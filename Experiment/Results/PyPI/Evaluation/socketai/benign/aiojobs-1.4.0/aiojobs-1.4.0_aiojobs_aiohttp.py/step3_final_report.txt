  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing an aiohttp-based scheduler, including setup, task spawning, and request-based atomic execution.",
  "sources": "Functions reading request data (get_scheduler, get_scheduler_from_request), scheduler instantiation (setup), and coroutine execution (spawn, shield, atomic).",
  "sinks": "spawn and shield invoke scheduler methods; atomic wraps request handlers, but no external data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Request -> get_scheduler -> spawn/shield/atomic -> scheduler methods -> coroutine execution; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and uses standard async patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code manages scheduler lifecycle and task execution within an aiohttp web app. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or malicious modifications. The functions are standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The potential for misuse exists if untrusted coroutines are scheduled, but this is inherent to scheduler design, not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for async scheduler management in aiohttp applications. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk score reflects typical concerns about misuse, not actual malicious activity.",
