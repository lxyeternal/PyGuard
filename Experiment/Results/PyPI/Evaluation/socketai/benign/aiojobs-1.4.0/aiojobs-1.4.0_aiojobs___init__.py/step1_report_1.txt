{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes for scheduling and managing background tasks asynchronously using asyncio.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and types, specifically the package's internal _job and _scheduler modules, and uses user-provided parameters in create_scheduler.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in create_scheduler are checked for validity, then passed directly to Scheduler instance creation. No external data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn to indicate deprecation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a factory function for creating Scheduler objects with parameter validation. It includes a deprecation warning for direct instantiation of Scheduler. There are no suspicious data handling, external network operations, or obfuscated code. The imports are from internal modules, likely part of the same package, and no external inputs are read or processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module for managing background tasks in asyncio. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
