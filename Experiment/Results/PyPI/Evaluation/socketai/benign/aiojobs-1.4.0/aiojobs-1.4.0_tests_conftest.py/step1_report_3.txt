{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures for testing the aiojobs Scheduler using pytest, creating and managing scheduler instances asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads static parameters from the PARAMS dictionary and creates Scheduler instances within async fixture functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external user input or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; scheduler creation and cleanup are straightforward object instantiations with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code employs standard async fixture patterns for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration parameters for the Scheduler, uses pytest fixtures to create and tear down scheduler instances asynchronously, and manages multiple scheduler objects cleanly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network or data access activity. The structure is standard for testing asynchronous code with no embedded malicious or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign test setup for the aiojobs Scheduler, with no malicious or security risks identified.",
