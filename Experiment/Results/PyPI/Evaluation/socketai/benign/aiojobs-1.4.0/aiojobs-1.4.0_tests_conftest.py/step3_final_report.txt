  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test setup code for asynchronous Scheduler management, with no external data or malicious patterns. It uses static parameters, proper cleanup, and no external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test fixture setup with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.",
