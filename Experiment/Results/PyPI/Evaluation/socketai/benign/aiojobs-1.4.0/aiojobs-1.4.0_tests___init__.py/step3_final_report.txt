  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, data input/output, environment variable access, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, eval()/exec() calls, network functions, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious eval()/exec(), obfuscated code, unusual variable names, dynamic code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. No suspicious network or file operations are detected. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution points are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies. The confidence in benign nature is high; the risk is low. The suspicion in some reports about obfuscation or dynamic code is unconfirmed due to lack of code evidence. Slightly increasing malware and obfuscation scores for suspected but unconfirmed obfuscation is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate. Slight adjustments for suspicion in some reports are recommended, but overall, the dependency is safe.",
