  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or automation, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files, environment variables, and possibly network sources (if present). Specific input points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, files, or environment variables to sinks like network transmissions, file operations, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions are evident from the code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step: starting with imports and initial setup, inspecting input points for data, reviewing data handling, and concluding with output or side-effect functions. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or data exfiltration routines are visible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to serve legitimate functions with no anomalies or security threats identified.",
