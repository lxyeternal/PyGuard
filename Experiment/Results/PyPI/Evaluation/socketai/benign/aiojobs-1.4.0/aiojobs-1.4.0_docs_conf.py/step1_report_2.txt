  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx, including version extraction and theme customization.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the __init__.py file in the aiojobs package, imports standard libraries, and processes configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package files to set version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard use of regex and file reading for version extraction; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical Sphinx configuration tasks, including importing modules, reading version info from a package file using regex, and setting documentation options. It does not execute external commands, connect to networks, or handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The only data read involves reading a package file to extract version info, which is a standard practice and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads version info securely from a package file and sets various configuration options for documentation generation.",
