  "purpose": "Standard Sphinx configuration for documentation, involving version extraction from a local file.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py using os.path, codecs.open, and regex.",
  "sinks": "Local file reading; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "File read -> regex parse -> version info stored; no external or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward regex usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple file I/O and regex parsing to extract version info, with no network activity, no dynamic code, and no secrets. It uses standard libraries and practices for configuration scripts. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The regex parsing is safe and typical for such tasks. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no external dependencies or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are accurate and justified.",
