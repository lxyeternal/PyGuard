  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scoring reflects the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, including version extraction.\n- **Sources:** Uses `os.path.abspath`, `codecs.open`, `re.search`, `match.groupdict()`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code reads version info from a local file using regex; no external data flows, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- **Score justification:** Given the benign nature, scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, focusing on version extraction and theme customization.\n- **Sources:** Reads version info from `__init__.py`, standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no malicious code.\n- **Risk assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard Sphinx configuration, reading version info, setting paths.\n- **Sources:** Filesystem operations, reading `__init__.py`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted input handling.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated code are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Sphinx configuration, version extraction.\n- **Sources:** Reading `__init__.py`, standard modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward file reading and regex parsing; no dynamic code, network, or secrets.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Score justification:** Security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high; perhaps a 0.0 would be more accurate, but it's minor.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative, but acceptable. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar configuration, version extraction.\n- **Sources:** Filesystem, standard modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No untrusted data, no network, no dynamic code.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1. Given the code's straightforward nature, even 0.1 may be slightly high; a score of 0 would be more precise.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks; minor version reading from local files)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No malicious or security concerns are justified here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe configuration script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring is appropriate, with perhaps a slight overestimation of the security risk in one report.",
