  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation for the aiojobs project.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the __init__.py file of aiojobs; reads files from the filesystem for version, templates, static files, and documentation source files.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used for system calls, network connections, or data processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; uses static configuration data for documentation generation. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regular expressions to parse version info, but implemented safely; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; commented-out code and standard library usage are normal for configuration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs filesystem operations to read version information and configure documentation build parameters. It imports standard modules like os, re, codecs, and typing, with no dynamic code execution, network access, or handling of untrusted input. The regex used for version parsing is straightforward and safely implemented. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The overall structure and content are consistent with typical Sphinx configuration files, and no obfuscated or malware-like patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads local files, sets configuration parameters, and does not perform any potentially harmful operations.",
