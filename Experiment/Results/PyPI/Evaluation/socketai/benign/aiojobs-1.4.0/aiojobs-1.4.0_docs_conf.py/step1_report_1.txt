  "anomalies": "Uses regex to parse version info from a file; no suspicious data flows. No hardcoded credentials or data leakage mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads version info from a local file using regex and sets up Sphinx documentation configuration. No external data is fetched or sent. The file operations are standard and safe. No malicious or suspicious activities detected. The code contains typical configuration and setup logic with no obfuscated code, network calls, or security-related vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file for documentation build setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
