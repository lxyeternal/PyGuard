The existing reports correctly identify the benign nature, though some overstate the security risk in one case. The appropriate assessment is that the code poses no security threat and should have malware, obfuscated, and risk scores set to 0."

The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. External dependencies should be reviewed for full security assurance, but based on the code, the overall risk is minimal."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to potential misuse of input data rather than active threats."

The low risk score reflects minor logical issues rather than security threats. The overall assessment indicates safe code that requires a review of the XOR operation and proper function invocation."
