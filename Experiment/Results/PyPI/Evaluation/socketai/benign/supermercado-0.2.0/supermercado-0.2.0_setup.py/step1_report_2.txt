  "purpose": "This code sets up the packaging configuration for the Python project 'supermercado', including reading descriptions, dependencies, and defining entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, user-defined metadata such as author and URL.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication beyond standard setup process.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of common setup tools and standard practices observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, reading files for description and dependencies, and defining package metadata. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. All operations are typical for Python packaging and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for packaging purposes.",
