{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'supermercado', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from README.md and requirements.txt files, and uses static values for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code only reads files and defines setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files (README.md, requirements.txt) into variables used in setup(), with no untrusted input processed during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading documentation and dependencies from files, defining package metadata, and configuring entry points. No dynamic execution, input validation, or suspicious patterns are present. The files read are static project files, not user input or external sources. The setup configuration appears typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks detected. It performs routine setup tasks without any suspicious activities or vulnerabilities.",
