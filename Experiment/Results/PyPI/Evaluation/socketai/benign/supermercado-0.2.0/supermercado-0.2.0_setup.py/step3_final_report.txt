{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads static files for description and dependencies, and configures package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, static package metadata definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, database, or external system interactions",
  "flows": "Reading static files during setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard setup procedures, no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading static files, defining package metadata, and setting entry points. It does not execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or handle untrusted input. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
