  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- They consistently identify no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- The code reads static files (README.md, requirements.txt) and uses standard functions.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on external files, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears correct and free of issues; no anomalies or security flaws are evident.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the above, the overall security risk should be minimal, likely 0 or very close to it.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is justified, given the code is straightforward.\n- The **security risk score** should be 0, as no vulnerabilities or suspicious activities are detected.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code performs a standard package setup, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.\n- The reliance on external files (README.md, requirements.txt) is typical for packaging and does not pose a security risk unless those files are malicious, which is outside the scope of this script.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**\n- **Scores should reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.**\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation or further analysis.",
