  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'supermercado'.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; reading requirements.txt for dependencies; reading package files via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to external systems or handles untrusted input data directly; no network or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity. External data sources are used only for package description and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading documentation, dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It uses safe file reading methods and standard setuptools functions. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, credential theft, or backdoors. The code strictly pertains to package configuration without executing untrusted code or manipulating system behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
