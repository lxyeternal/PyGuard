{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing tiles, features, and coordinate transformations, likely for geospatial data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include tiles (either JSON strings or matched strings), features (likely from GeoJSON), and coordinate arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code transforms coordinate data and yields features; no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input data (tiles, features, coordinates) flows through parsing, filtering, and coordinate transformation functions, resulting in transformed feature geometries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The use of numpy for mathematical operations and regex for parsing is standard. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geospatial data processing: parsing tile identifiers, computing coordinate ranges, creating masks, filtering features based on geometry types, and converting coordinates from projected to geographic form. The functions and class methods are straightforward, with no suspicious code or side effects. All data flows are typical for geospatial processing workflows. There are no external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The code appears benign, focusing on data parsing and coordinate transformations, which are common in mapping applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard geospatial data processing module with no malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The code performs expected operations with clear logic and no suspicious patterns.",
