{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing, filtering, and transforming geospatial features and tiles, primarily for processing map data.",
  "sources": "Input data includes tile identifiers (strings or JSON), feature collections with geometry types, and coordinate arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code transforms coordinate data and filters features; no direct data leaks or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (tiles, features) is parsed and filtered; coordinate data flows through transformation functions like xy_to_lng_lat and unproject, which modify feature coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions perform standard geospatial operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of parsing functions, feature filtering based on geometry types, and coordinate transformations typical for geospatial processing. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The coordinate transformation functions could be misused if fed malicious data, but this is inherent to such operations and not malicious per se. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard geospatial data processing tasks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to potential misuse of input data rather than active threats.",
