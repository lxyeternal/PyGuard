  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard geospatial data processing tasks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to potential misuse of input data rather than active threats."
