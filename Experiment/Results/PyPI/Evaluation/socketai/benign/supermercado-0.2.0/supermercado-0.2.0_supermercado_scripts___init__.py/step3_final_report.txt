  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or external modules; no explicit data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Data may reach system calls, network, or storage, but no specific sink patterns are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks such as files or network, with no suspicious or malicious pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence is high (0.9), and the reasoning aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
