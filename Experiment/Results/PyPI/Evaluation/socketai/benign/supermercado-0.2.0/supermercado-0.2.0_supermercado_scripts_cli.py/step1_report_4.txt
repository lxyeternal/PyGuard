{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for processing geographic tile data, including extracting edges, union of tiles, and burning features into tiles at a specified zoom level.",
  "sources": "Input files read via click.open_file, features provided through cligj decorators, and arguments/flags from CLI options.",
  "sinks": "Output via click.echo, including JSON dumps and list conversions; no untrusted data directly fed into system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input is read from files or CLI arguments, processed through imported modules, and results are output as JSON or lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. External modules are used for core processing, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI with three commands, each reading data from files or CLI arguments, processing via imported functions, and outputting results. There are no evident data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activities. The code relies on third-party modules for processing, and all data handling appears confined to local inputs/outputs. No suspicious code constructs or behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper around geographic data processing functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
