  "purpose": "Define CLI commands for processing tile and GeoJSON data related to the supermercado package functionalities such as finding edges, union of tiles, and burning features into tiles.",
  "sources": "Input files read via click.open_file(inputtiles). Data is read from files or strings provided as command arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs via click.echo(), including tile lists in JSON or list format; potential data leaks if input contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input read from files or strings -> processed by functions in supermercado modules -> output via click.echo()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or unusual code behavior detected. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe imports beyond standard libraries and known packages.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up CLI commands with input handling and calls to external modules (edge_finder, uniontiles, burntiles, super_utils). Input files are opened and read line-by-line; output is printed to console. No network connections, no data exfiltration, no command injection, or suspicious code patterns identified. The external functions are imported from the supermercado package, which appears domain-specific and is not suspicious in isolation. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual control flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for processing geographic and tile data. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It relies on external, presumably legitimate, modules to perform the core processing. The code itself does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
