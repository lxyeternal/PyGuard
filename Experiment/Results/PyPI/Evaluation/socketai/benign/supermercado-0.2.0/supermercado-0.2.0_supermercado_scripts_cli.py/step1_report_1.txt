{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line tools for processing tiles and GeoJSON features related to 'supermercado' operations, including edge detection, union, and burning features into tiles.",
  "sources": "Input streams read via click.open_file for 'inputtiles', and features input via cligj features_in_arg, sequence_opt, and command arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output streams via click.echo; potentially vulnerable if untrusted input is processed or output contains sensitive data, but no direct data leakage or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or command arguments is read into memory, processed by functions like findedges, uniontiles.union, and burntiles.burn, then output via click.echo. No untrusted data directly influences system commands or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Use of standard libraries and conventions, no obfuscated code detected. Input handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands that process input tiles and GeoJSON features using functions from imported modules. Input streams are read from files or command-line arguments, then passed to processing functions. Outputs are printed to standard output. No suspicious code paths, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The modules called (edge_finder, uniontiles, burntiles, super_utils) are external but their use appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a command-line utility for processing geographic tiles and features, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses standard input/output methods, no suspicious data handling, and relies on external libraries that are typical for geospatial processing.",
