  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for geospatial tile processing functions including edge detection, union, and burning features into tiles.",
  "sources": "Input files or command-line arguments read via click.open_file or direct arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output via click.echo or json.dumps, no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from files or args into external processing functions, results are output directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that delegates processing to external domain-specific modules. It handles input/output securely, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. External modules are assumed legitimate; no network activity or code injection present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, domain-specific CLI utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
