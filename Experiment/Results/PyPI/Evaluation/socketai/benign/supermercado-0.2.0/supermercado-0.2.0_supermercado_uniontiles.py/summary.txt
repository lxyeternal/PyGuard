  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate geospatial processing utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. External dependencies should be reviewed for full security assurance, but based on the code, the overall risk is minimal."
