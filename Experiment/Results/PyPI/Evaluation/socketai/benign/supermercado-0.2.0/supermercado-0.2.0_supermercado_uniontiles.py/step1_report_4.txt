{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform geographic data processing, specifically merging tiles into a unioned feature collection using coordinate transformations and raster data.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules ('supermercado', 'rasterio', 'mercantile', 'numpy', 'click', 'json') and uses internal functions like 'tile_parser' and 'get_range' that likely process geographic tiles. External data sources are not directly evident.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present. The code does not perform network operations, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves parsing tile data, calculating geographic bounds, creating an affine transformation, rasterizing shapes, and unprojecting features. There are no evident paths where untrusted data influences security-critical operations such as command execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are detected. The code's structure is straightforward. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors is apparent. Functions from external libraries are used as intended for geographic processing.",
  "analysis": "The code processes geographic tiles, computes spatial bounds, creates affine transformations, rasterizes shapes, and unprojects features for geographic visualization or analysis. The functions utilized seem standard for spatial data workflows. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident. No input from external sources (like user input or network data) that could be exploited is used. The code relies on internal modules ('supermercado', 'rasterio', 'mercantile'), which are standard in geospatial workflows. There is no indication of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard geographic data processing tool with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs spatial calculations and feature generation without insecure or suspicious operations.",
