  "purpose": "Geospatial tile processing, rasterization, and feature unprojection for map data synthesis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'inputtiles' and 'parsenames'; external 'super_utils' module; rasterio's shape extraction; mercantile's coordinate functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from 'features.shapes' processing, but no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Tile parsing -> extent calculation -> affine transformation -> raster shape creation -> shape extraction -> unprojection of features.",
  "anomalies": "Main block calls 'union()' with no arguments, which would cause a runtime error; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GIS tasks using reputable libraries; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Reliance on external 'super_utils' warrants trust but cannot be verified here. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The only flaw is the missing arguments in the main call, unrelated to security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate geospatial processing utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. External dependencies should be reviewed for full security assurance, but based on the code, the overall risk is minimal.",
