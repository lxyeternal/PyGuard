  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the appropriateness of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules related to geospatial or graphical processing.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is mentioned.\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard, and lack any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The only difference among reports is their assigned scores, particularly malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import code, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score, but since the code only imports modules, this seems overestimated. No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0, as no actual risk is present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores should be adjusted downward, especially securityRisk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same benign import structure.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same benign pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.25\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly elevated but not justified based solely on import statements. No evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.\n- **Verdict:** Overestimated.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.0 (should be 0)  |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.0          |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.0          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.0 (should be 0)  |\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All should be 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Should be lowered to 0 for all reports, given the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The initial higher scores for some reports are unjustified based on the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores for the entire set:**\n\n| malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scoring should reflect that, with all scores at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
