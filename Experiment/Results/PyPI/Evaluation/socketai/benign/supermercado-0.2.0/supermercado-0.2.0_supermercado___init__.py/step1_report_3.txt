{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to edge finding, burn tiles, and union tiles, likely for spatial or graphical processing.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a future import to ensure compatibility. It imports internal modules, which suggests modular design. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code execution. The code does not perform any operations, input/output, or network activities. The imports are standard and seem intended for geometric or graphical processing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement block with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger, modular project without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
