{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports other modules related to tile processing, such as edge finding, burning tiles, and union operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules, which may contain functions or data relevant to their respective operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; the imports suggest modular code structure but no direct data flow analysis can be performed here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a Python package; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement block, importing modules using relative imports. It uses the future import for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network interactions are present. The imports relate to tile processing functions, likely for geographic or graphical computations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign module import structure with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security issues detected.",
