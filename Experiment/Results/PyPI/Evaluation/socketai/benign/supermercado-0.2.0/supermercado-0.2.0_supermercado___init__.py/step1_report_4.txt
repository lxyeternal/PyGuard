{
  "purpose": "Module import statements for geographical or spatial data processing, importing submodules related to edge finding, burn tiles, and union tiles.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; imports are static and from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a future import and relative imports of three submodules. No data input, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of relative imports is typical for internal package structure. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import of internal modules with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or anomalies. The likelihood of malicious behavior is extremely low.",
