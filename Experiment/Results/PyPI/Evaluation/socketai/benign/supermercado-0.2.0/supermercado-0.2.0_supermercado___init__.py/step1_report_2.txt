{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to edge finding, burn tiles, and union tiles, likely for processing geospatial or graphical data.",
  "sources": "Module imports; no direct input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points, such as network or file operations, are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are explicitly defined in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code complexity; straightforward imports with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement block with no data processing, user input, or untrusted data sources. It imports three modules, possibly internal, with no indication of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs are present. The only notable aspect is the use of relative imports, which is common in package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is part of a larger codebase that likely performs geospatial or graphical computations. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
