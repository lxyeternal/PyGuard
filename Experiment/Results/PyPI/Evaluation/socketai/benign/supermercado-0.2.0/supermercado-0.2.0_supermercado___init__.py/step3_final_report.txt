{
  "purpose": "This code imports internal modules related to geospatial or graphical processing, with no executable logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package: edge_finder (aliased as edgetiles), burntiles, uniontiles",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or external data sources",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow, only static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, with a future import for absolute imports. There is no executable code, data handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign module setup. The security and malware scores should be zero, and the risk score should be minimal, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify the benign nature, though some overstate the security risk in one case. The appropriate assessment is that the code poses no security threat and should have malware, obfuscated, and risk scores set to 0.",
