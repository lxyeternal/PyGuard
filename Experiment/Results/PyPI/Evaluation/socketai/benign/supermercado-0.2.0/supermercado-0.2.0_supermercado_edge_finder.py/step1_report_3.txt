{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process tile data to identify edges and return an array of edge coordinates with associated zoom levels.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters 'inputtiles' and 'parsenames', and from the imported modules 'click', 'json', 're', and 'super_utils' from 'supermercado'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include untrusted data sinks such as network communications, file writing, or system modifications. It processes data internally and returns results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through tile parsing and range calculations, then via array manipulations to produce edge coordinate data with zoom levels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of external library 'super_utils' is legitimate as long as its implementation is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries and a custom utility module. It defines a function 'findedges' that processes tile data, calculates ranges, zoom levels, and edges by array rolling and min operations. The main block calls 'findedges' with no arguments, which would raise an error due to missing parameters. No network communication, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The code appears to perform a legitimate computational task related to spatial data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard spatial data processing script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external utilities for core functionality. The lack of network operations, file access, or hidden behaviors suggests it is safe, provided the 'super_utils' library is trustworthy.",
