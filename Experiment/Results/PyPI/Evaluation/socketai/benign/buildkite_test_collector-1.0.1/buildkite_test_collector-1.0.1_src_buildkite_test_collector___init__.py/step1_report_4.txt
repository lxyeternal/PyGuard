{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be intended for data processing or utility functions within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, external files (if any), environment variables, or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network calls, file writes, or system commands that could handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions or data transformations; specific flows depend on the code structure and input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns were identified. The code does not contain obfuscated or overly complex constructs that obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully examined at all segments, including imports, function definitions, conditional logic, and main execution blocks. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior was detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and not malicious. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, network communication with suspicious domains, or system damage mechanisms were found. The code executes typical data processing tasks without involving any insecure patterns, unsafe eval calls, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent. It performs standard operations without suspicious patterns or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
