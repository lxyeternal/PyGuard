{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or script, but without specific context or comments, its exact function is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from environment variables, function parameters, or external modules such as 'os' and 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach system calls like 'os.system', 'subprocess', or network-related functions if present. Also, data processed for sensitive information such as credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through functions or modules, potentially reaching system commands or output functions without proper validation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential anomalies include use of dynamic execution functions like 'eval' or 'exec', hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. No such anomalies are immediately evident in the visible code, but the absence of comments or validation routines is notable.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and appears to use standard Python libraries without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network calls are evident. The structure does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Without external context or hidden payloads, the code seems benign. However, incomplete snippets or missing context could hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard script with no obvious malicious activity or supply chain attack indicators.",
