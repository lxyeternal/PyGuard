{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of a Python package or module, potentially with some utility functions or classes. No clear operational intent is evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or external modules if any are used, but no specific input sources are shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls if present, but none are explicitly shown in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input/output operations demonstrated, no source-to-sink data flows are identifiable from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or package with no signs of malicious behavior. No evidence of data leakage, insecure coding practices, or hidden backdoors is visible. The absence of network activity, cryptographic misuse, or secret exfiltration points to low suspicion. Lack of contextual details limits full assessment, but based on the visible code, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet. It functions as a typical Python module with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.",
