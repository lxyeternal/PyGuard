  "purpose": "Buildkite test collector plugin for Pytest to capture and report test execution data.",
  "sources": "User input via pytest hooks, test report objects, in_flight dictionary, nodeid, report object, item object, location data, test data objects.",
  "sinks": "Saving payload as JSON file, updating payload object, possibly writing to disk via save_payload_as_json.",
  "flows": "Input data from pytest hooks -> test data objects (start, pass, fail, skip, finish) -> payload update, save to JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code appears to be straightforward test data collection and storage logic. Usage of uuid4() is standard for generating unique IDs. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a pytest plugin that tracks test execution states and saves results into a payload object. It uses UUIDs for test identification and logs debug information. It does not include network calls, code injection, or any data leakage mechanisms. The payload is saved as JSON at the end, which is a standard and safe operation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are evident. The logic appears to be standard test data collection code, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for collecting test data, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply tracks test states and saves results, with no suspicious behavior.",
