{
  "purpose": "Define a wrapper class around Python's monotonic clock to represent and manipulate time instants",
  "sources": "The method Instant.now() reads system's monotonic time via time.monotonic()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could leak information are present",
  "flows": "The code flows from calling Instant.now() to retrieve the current monotonic time, stored in the seconds attribute",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple, well-structured class to encapsulate monotonic time instants. It uses Python's built-in time.monotonic() as a source, which is safe and intended for measuring durations. There are no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file operations that could be malicious. The methods for addition and subtraction handle timedelta and Instant objects appropriately without unsafe behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for representing monotonic time instants. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this code segment.",
