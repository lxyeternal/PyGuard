  "purpose": "A wrapper class around the system's monotonic clock to measure relative times accurately.",
  "sources": "Reading system's monotonic clock via time.monotonic() in the now() method.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the system clock to the creation of Instant objects; no external or untrusted data flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and primarily for timing measurement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Instant' which encapsulates monotonic time readings. The class provides addition and subtraction operations with timedelta objects and a class method now() to fetch the current monotonic time. All functions interact only with system time functions and do not perform any network I/O, file operations, or other side effects. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. The implementation appears to be a standard utility for timing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility class for timing measurement using monotonic clock, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks.",
