  "purpose": "To provide a wrapper around the system's monotonic clock for accurate relative time measurements.",
  "sources": "time.monotonic() for getting current monotonic time",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The source (time.monotonic()) feeds into the creation of an Instant object, with no data flow to external or untrusted components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class wrapping around the system's monotonic clock, with methods for addition, subtraction, and creation of instances using time.monotonic(). All functions utilize standard Python library calls, with no external network or data handling. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a monotonic clock wrapper, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
