  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper class around the system's monotonic clock to measure relative time intervals accurately.",
  "sources": "time.monotonic() in the now() class method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the system's monotonic clock via time.monotonic() to instantiate an Instant object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, immutable data class for managing monotonic time, avoiding reliance on wall clock time which can change. The class includes methods for adding timedelta objects, subtracting instants, and obtaining the current time using time.monotonic(). There are no external data inputs, no network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose for time measurement without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for managing monotonic time, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
