  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for monotonic time measurement. All reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code can be considered safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts where reliable timing is needed."
