  "purpose": "Setup and manage pytest hooks and fixtures for Buildkite CI/CD integration, including environment detection, payload collection, registration, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "detect_env(), Payload.init(), submit(), and save_payload_as_json() functions, environment variables, pytest configuration and plugin management.",
  "sinks": "submit() function likely sends data over the network; save_payload_as_json() writes to a file.",
  "flows": "detect_env() -> Payload.init() -> plugin registration -> pytest hooks -> submit() during unconfigure -> optional save_payload_as_json()",
  "anomalies": "Use of setattr() and del on pytest config object is typical; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for Buildkite, managing environment detection, payload collection, registration, and cleanup. External functions are assumed safe; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network activity via submit() is expected for reporting purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are identified. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by typical CI/CD data transmission, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward pytest plugin for Buildkite, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the context, though it could be slightly lowered if desired. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use.",
