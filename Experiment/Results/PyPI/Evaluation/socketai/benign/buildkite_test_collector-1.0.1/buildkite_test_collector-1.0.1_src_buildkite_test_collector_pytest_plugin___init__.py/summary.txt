  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward pytest plugin for Buildkite, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the context, though it could be slightly lowered if desired. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use."
