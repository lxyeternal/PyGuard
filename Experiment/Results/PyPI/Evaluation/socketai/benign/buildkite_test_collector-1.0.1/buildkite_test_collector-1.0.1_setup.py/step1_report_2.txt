  "purpose": "Setup script for building and distributing the Python package 'buildkite_test_collector'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; imports constants from 'src.buildkite_test_collector.collector'.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported constants for package metadata; installs dependencies via 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "flows": "Imports constants from a local module, uses file reading for description, sets up package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual code behaviors. Constants are imported from local source, which appears normal. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package: reading a README file, importing constants for package metadata, specifying dependencies, and defining entry points. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The use of 'setuptools' and well-known dependency specifications align with normal packaging practices. The imported constants are from a local module, which is a common pattern to centralize configuration, not suspicious. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. It performs standard package setup procedures without any suspicious code or behavior.",
