{
  "purpose": "Configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the Python package 'buildkite_test_collector'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports constants from 'src.buildkite_test_collector.collector'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Constants are imported from a local module; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports configuration constants, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The imported constants are from a local module, which is typical for internal configuration. The script follows best practices and contains no malicious or risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
