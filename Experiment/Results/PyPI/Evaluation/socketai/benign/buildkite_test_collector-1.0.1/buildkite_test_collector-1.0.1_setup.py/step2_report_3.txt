  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, network activity, or data handling beyond typical package setup.\n- Constants are imported from a local module, which is normal for configuration.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dependencies.\n- The code reads a README.md file for long description, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code's purpose.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no untrusted data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk is set at 0.1, which seems slightly high for a benign setup script. It might be a default low risk assigned to all scripts, but since there's no real risk, a lower score (e.g., 0.0 or 0.05) would be more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; standard setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; the securityRisk score is slightly high but acceptable if considering minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** This is more appropriate; no risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate. The script does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Slightly high at 0.1 in some reports, but given the benign nature, it should be closer to 0.0. The setup script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final judgment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable, except for the minor securityRisk score which should be lowered to reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.0\n\nThe high confidence (1.0) is justified given the straightforward, well-understood code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify that imported constants do not contain sensitive data or secrets, but based on the provided code and reports, no such issues are evident here.",
