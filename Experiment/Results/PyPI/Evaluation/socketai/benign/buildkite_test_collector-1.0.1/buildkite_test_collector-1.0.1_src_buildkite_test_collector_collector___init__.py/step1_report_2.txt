{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing or similar tasks, but no specific purpose can be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potentially user input via function parameters or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data over sockets or HTTP requests), file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or os.system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file, system commands), passing through functions or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are observed in the provided snippet. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables or user input, processes this data through various functions, and may output or send the data elsewhere. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, or backdoors are explicitly visible. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not inherently suggest malicious intent. The code does not contain suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Without additional context or hidden payloads, the overall structure appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. The code looks like typical application logic without suspicious features. However, due to the limited snippet, a low confidence level is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
