  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network connections, file I/O, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via data processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code appears benign",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, credential leaks, or backdoors are evident. The absence of code or minimal code snippets limits detection, but descriptions indicate benign intent. The confidence score is high (0.9), malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2). No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified. Overall, the code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
