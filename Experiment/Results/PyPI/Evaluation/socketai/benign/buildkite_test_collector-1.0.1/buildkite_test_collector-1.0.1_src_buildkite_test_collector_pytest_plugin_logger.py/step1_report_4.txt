  "purpose": "Set up a configurable internal logger for a plugin or module.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED' and the module's own code.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to standard output via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences log level; logger configuration determines logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard logging setup with environment-based configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger, configuring its level based on an environment variable. It adds a StreamHandler with a simple formatter if no handlers are present, and disables propagation. This is standard logging setup without any suspicious or malicious code. The environment variable used for toggling debug level is common and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign logger setup. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as expected for logging configuration without any signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
