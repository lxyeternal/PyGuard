  "purpose": "To set up and configure a logger for internal plugin debugging and information output.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED' to determine log level.",
  "sinks": "Logging output sent to standard output via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> Logger level set -> Handler added -> Log messages output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behavior observed. The environment variable is used to control log level, which is normal practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with configurable verbosity based on an environment variable. It adds a stream handler to output logs to stdout, with a specific formatter. No untrusted input sources or malicious code flows are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or system modifications. It is a straightforward logger setup intended for debugging and normal logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe logger configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It uses environment variables appropriately to control debug level and handles logging setup safely.",
