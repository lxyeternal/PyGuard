  "purpose": "Configure and provide a customizable internal logger for a plugin or module.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED', module name, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to the console via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences log level; logger setup and handler configuration determine where logs are output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard logger setup. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with a configurable log level based on an environment variable. It adds a console handler if none exists to avoid duplicates and disables propagation to prevent double logging. The logic is straightforward, adheres to standard practices, and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logger configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to facilitate logging in a controlled manner.",
