  "purpose": "Set up a configurable Python logger with environment-based log level and prevent duplicate handlers.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED' for log level configuration",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> logger level set -> handler added if none exists",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward logger setup with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create and configure a logger, setting its level based on an environment variable and adding a stream handler if needed. It disables propagation to prevent duplicate logs. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard practices and is clear and simple. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The environment variable usage is typical and does not introduce security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
