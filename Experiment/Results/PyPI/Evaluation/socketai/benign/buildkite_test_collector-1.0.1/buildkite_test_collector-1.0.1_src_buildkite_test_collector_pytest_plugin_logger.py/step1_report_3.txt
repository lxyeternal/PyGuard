  "purpose": "Configure and provide a logging utility for internal plugin use, allowing logging at different levels based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED' read to determine log level.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to standard output via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences log level; logging output is sent to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code functions purely to set up logging behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with a configurable level based on an environment variable. It adds a StreamHandler for output and prevents duplicate handlers. No malicious activity or security risks are present; the code is standard and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logger setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or anomalies. The implementation appears secure and standard.",
