  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured data management module for test analytics. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of 0.1, reflecting benign logging, is conservative but acceptable. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for supply chain use."
