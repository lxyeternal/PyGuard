{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates styled terminal output using the 'termcolor' library, printing various colors, highlights, attributes, and combinations.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'TERM' environment variable; outputs styled text via 'cprint' calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or transmitted; only environment variable read and terminal output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TERM' read -> printed; styled text output via 'cprint' with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward use of a third-party library for demonstration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static demonstration of terminal styling features. It reads an environment variable 'TERM' but does not process untrusted input or perform any network or file operations. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The code's behavior is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The 'termcolor' library is used solely for styling output, and all signals point to a benign, demonstrative script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The environment variable reading is standard and not risky. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
