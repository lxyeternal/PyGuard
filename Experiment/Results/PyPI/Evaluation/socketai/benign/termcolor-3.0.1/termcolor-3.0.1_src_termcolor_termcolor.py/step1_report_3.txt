{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to output colored and styled text in terminal environments using ANSI escape sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., NO_COLOR, FORCED_COLOR, TERM) and system stdout properties (fileno, isatty) to determine color support.",
  "sinks": "Uses ANSI escape sequences to format text; does not appear to send data externally or store input data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, system terminal properties) influence the decision to apply color formatting; formatted output is generated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses standard terminal formatting techniques without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dictionaries for ANSI color attributes, highlights, and colors, then checks environment variables and terminal properties to determine if color output is allowed. The 'colored' function applies ANSI codes based on user parameters and environment checks. The 'cprint' function prints the colorized text. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, data leaks, or external network activity. The code is a typical utility for terminal formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ANSI terminal formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or transmit data maliciously. It appears safe and intended for aesthetic terminal output.",
