  "purpose": "Provide ANSI color formatting and printing functions for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries: os, sys, io. Reads environment variables for color configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs output formatting and printing. No untrusted data flows to external systems or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input (text, environment variables) → Formatting functions → Console output via print()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for terminal color formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dictionaries for color attributes and formatting, checks environment variables to determine if coloring should be applied, and provides functions for applying color and printing colored text. It uses standard environment variables and sys.stdout attributes to control color output. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious control flow. It strictly adheres to normal ANSI color formatting logic without any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ANSI color formatting library for terminal output. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
