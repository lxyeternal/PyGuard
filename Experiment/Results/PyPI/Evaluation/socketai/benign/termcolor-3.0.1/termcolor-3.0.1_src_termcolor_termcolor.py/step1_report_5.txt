{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for ANSI color formatting and terminal output styling for terminal applications.",
  "sources": "It reads environment variables (NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR, etc.) and system properties (sys.stdout).",
  "sinks": "It outputs colorized strings to terminal via print, which can display styled text.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence color display; the colored() function applies ANSI codes based on parameters; cprint() outputs styled text to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No use of untrusted input sources or network operations. Code primarily deals with output styling; no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks environment variables to determine whether to enable color output, then applies ANSI escape sequences to style terminal text. No input is taken from untrusted sources other than environment variables, which are standard for terminal styling. No data is sent over the network, no file system modifications, and no malicious system commands are executed. The functions serve purely aesthetic purposes, with no evident malicious intent or sabotage. The code is well-structured and appears to be a straightforward implementation for colored terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI color formatting library intended for styling terminal output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It simply manages ANSI escape sequences based on environment variables and function parameters. Overall, it appears safe and non-malicious.",
