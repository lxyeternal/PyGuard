{
  "purpose": "Provide ANSI color formatting and output functions for terminal display.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variables; sys.stdout for output stream; function parameters for text, color, on_color, attrs.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code outputs colorized text to the terminal but does not handle untrusted input beyond formatting.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether color is applied; input text is formatted and printed via cprint, but no data is transmitted externally or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code only deals with terminal text formatting and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dictionaries for terminal color attributes, includes functions to determine if coloring is enabled based on environment variables and terminal capabilities, and functions to apply ANSI escape codes to text for colored output. The logic is straightforward and primarily involves environment checks and string formatting. No input handling, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for colored terminal output, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manipulates text presentation and respects environment variables to disable or enable colors. No malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
