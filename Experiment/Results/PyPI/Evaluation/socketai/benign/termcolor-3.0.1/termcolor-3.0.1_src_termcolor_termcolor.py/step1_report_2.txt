{
  "purpose": "Provides ANSI color formatting for terminal output, enabling colorized and styled text display.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR, TERM), sys.stdout, and input text.",
  "sinks": "Outputs colorized text to terminal via print, and potentially interprets environment variables that influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and sys.stdout capabilities; applies color/style codes to input text; outputs via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of ANSI color formatting. It checks environment variables to determine if color should be applied, and formats input text accordingly. It respects system capabilities and user configurations. No external data sources, no network activity, no credential handling, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal color formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and performs only display-related functions as intended.",
