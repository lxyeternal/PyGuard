  "purpose": "Utility module for applying ANSI color and style formatting to terminal output, based on environment variables and terminal capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR, TERM) and system properties (sys.stdout) to determine if coloring is enabled.",
  "sinks": "Formats text with ANSI escape sequences and outputs via print; no external data handling or transmission.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and terminal properties influence whether color codes are applied; formatted strings are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard for terminal styling. Minor note: 'grey' mapped to 30 (black) for compatibility, not an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code checks environment variables and terminal properties to decide on applying ANSI colors. It defines dictionaries for color attributes, highlights, and colors. Functions 'colored' and 'cprint' generate ANSI escape sequences for styling text. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The implementation is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Minor potential concern is reliance on environment variables, but this is typical for such utilities and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for terminal styling with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as harmless, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as zero or near-zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
