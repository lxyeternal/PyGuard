{
  "purpose": "To provide ANSI color formatting functions and constants for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and termcolor module, specifically ATTRIBUTES, COLORS, HIGHLIGHTS, RESET, colored, cprint.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data leaks; the code only re-exports imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific symbols from the termcolor package and re-exports them for external use. It includes a __future__ import for annotations, which is standard. There are no input sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to security issues. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or code injection, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a simple wrapper or alias for the termcolor package's color formatting functions and constants. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, poses no security risks, and functions solely to facilitate colored terminal output.",
