{
  "purpose": "Provide ANSI color formatting capabilities for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__ (annotations), import attributes from termcolor.termcolor module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks or external communications present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, importing and exporting color formatting functions and constants",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that re-exports specific constants and functions from the termcolor library for terminal text styling. It uses the __future__.annotations import for future compatibility and defines __all__ for export control. There are no inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that re-exports features from a well-known library for terminal coloring. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
