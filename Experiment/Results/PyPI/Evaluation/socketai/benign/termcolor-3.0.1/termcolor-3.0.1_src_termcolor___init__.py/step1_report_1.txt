{
  "purpose": "Provides ANSI color formatting utilities for terminal output, wrapping functions from the termcolor library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and termcolor.termcolor; no external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions and constants from termcolor; no sinks that process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Imports and re-exports attributes and functions related to terminal coloring; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports features from the future module and a third-party termcolor library, then re-exports certain constants and functions for coloring terminal output. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external communication. It appears to serve as a utility module to facilitate terminal coloring, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions solely as an interface to the termcolor library for terminal text formatting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
