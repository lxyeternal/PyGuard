{
  "purpose": "A utility module that imports specific ANSI color formatting functions and constants from the 'termcolor' library and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'termcolor.termcolor' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static re-export of library symbols",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; purely static import and export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward re-export with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal wrapper that imports constants and functions from a third-party library and re-exports them via __all__. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or communicate externally. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and static nature eliminate the possibility of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module serving as a wrapper for terminal color formatting functions. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. All signals and scores should reflect this benign assessment.",
