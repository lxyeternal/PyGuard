{
  "purpose": "Provides ANSI color formatting utilities for terminal output using the termcolor library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for annotations; imports specific functions and constants from termcolor.termcolor.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscation; code appears standard and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for compatibility, then imports color-related constants and functions from the termcolor library. It then defines __all__ to explicitly export these symbols. No dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious logic is present. The code is a simple wrapper or re-export of existing library components, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports parts of the termcolor library for ANSI coloring support. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard utility code with no suspicious elements.",
