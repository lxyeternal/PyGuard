  "purpose": "Provide ANSI color formatting for terminal output using the termcolor library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and termcolor, and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "targets": "No specific sinks indicating untrusted data handling or output, as the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "flows": "The code imports and exposes functions and constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code strictly imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports formatting constants and functions from the termcolor library and makes them available for other modules. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or system modifications. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected, and no untrusted data handling. The code's structure is straightforward and standard for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves solely as an interface to re-export functionalities from the termcolor library. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
