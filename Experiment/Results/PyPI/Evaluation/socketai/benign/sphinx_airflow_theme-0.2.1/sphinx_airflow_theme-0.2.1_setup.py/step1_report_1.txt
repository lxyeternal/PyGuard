  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'sphinx_airflow_theme' Python package, including file checks and package metadata.",
  "sources": "File system checks for required static files, reading the README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "flows": "File existence check flows into potential exception raising; reading README flows into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The static file check and package setup are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a file existence check for specific static assets, raising an exception if missing. It reads a README file for the long description and then proceeds to define package metadata and dependencies for setup. All operations are standard for a Python package setup script. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code strictly handles package configuration and static file verification, which are typical in package build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with a static file existence check. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or malware indicators. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
