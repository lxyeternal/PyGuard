  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package for the sphinx_airflow_theme, including verifying required files and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "os.path.isfile() to check for required static files; reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sink that leads untrusted data to a dangerous operation or external system; no output or network activity.",
  "flows": "File existence checks to setup configuration; reading static files and setting package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code performs standard setup operations with file existence validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, performs straightforward file existence validation, reads a markdown file, and configures package setup parameters. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, nor handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The checks are limited to static file presence, typical for setup scripts. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing file validation and package configuration without any malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
