  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the script is a standard package setup script, performing static file checks and reading a README for metadata. No malicious behavior, untrusted data, or network activity is present.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code performs static file existence checks with `os.path.isfile()`, raising an exception if missing. This is a common practice.\n  - Reads `README.md` for long description.\n  - Calls `setup()` with package metadata, static files, and entry points.\n  - No untrusted data sources, no network activity, no obfuscated code.\n  - The logic is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup procedures, static file verification, and package configuration. No suspicious or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Verifies static files with `os.path.isfile()`.\n  - Reads `README.md`.\n  - Uses `setup()` with package data, entry points, dependencies.\n  - No dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no untrusted input handling.\n  - No obfuscation or malware indicators.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup script, with static file checks and package configuration, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same pattern: static file existence check, reading README, setting up package.\n  - No untrusted input, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n  - All operations are typical and safe.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard setup script, static file validation, package metadata configuration, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n  - File checks and setup calls are standard.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous reports, emphasizing standard package setup with static file checks and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input.\n  - Static checks are typical.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard setup script, performing static file checks, reading a README, and calling `setup()`. No malicious code, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly assigned 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign, all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely configuration for package distribution.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n- The static file checks are standard for ensuring package completeness.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. The code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The entire review confirms that the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
