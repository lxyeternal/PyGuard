{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script for the 'sphinx_airflow_theme', performing static file existence checks, reading README.md for long description, and configuring package metadata and data.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for required static files, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static checks and setup configuration are benign.",
  "flows": "File existence verification leads to exception if missing; README reading supplies package description; setup() configures package metadata and data.",
  "anomalies": "Minor grammatical typo in exception message ('You need copy these files...'), but no security relevance.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file verification, reads a README for package description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and data. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated segments. The static file checks are standard for ensuring package completeness. No untrusted input handling or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and typical for package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
