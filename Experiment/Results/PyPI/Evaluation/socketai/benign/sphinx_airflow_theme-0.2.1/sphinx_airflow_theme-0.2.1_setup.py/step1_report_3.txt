{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'sphinx_airflow_theme', used to distribute a Sphinx theme for Airflow documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'README.md'; Checking existence of required static files; Reading environment variables via os module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content and verifying static file existence, then passing data into setup() parameters; No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; static file checks are standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file existence validation, reads a markdown file for description, and configures package setup parameters. All operations are standard for package distribution. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The use of os.path.isfile for static file verification and setup() for packaging is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. It is purely for distribution purposes.",
