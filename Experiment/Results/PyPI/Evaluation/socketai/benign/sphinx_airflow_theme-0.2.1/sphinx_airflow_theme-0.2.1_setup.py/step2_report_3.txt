  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a standard setup script verifying static files and reading README.md.\n- Sources: Filesystem checks, static file presence, README reading.\n- Sinks: None of concern; static configuration.\n- Flows: File existence check → exception; README reading → package metadata.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard package setup script; no untrusted data, network activity, or malicious logic.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe, with no malware or security issues.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; emphasizes standard setup operations.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign setup script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on static file checks, README reading, and package configuration.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Typical setup script, safe and legitimate.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports; standard static file verification and package setup.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard package setup code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: static file checks, README reading, package configuration.\n- No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe setup script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, score 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security concerns, the overall risk score should be 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
