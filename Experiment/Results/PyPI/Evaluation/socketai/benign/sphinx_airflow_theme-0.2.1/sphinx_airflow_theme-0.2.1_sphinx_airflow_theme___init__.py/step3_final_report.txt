  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Sphinx theme for documentation, setting theme paths, options, and including static assets.",
  "sources": "Path computations using os.path, configuration object modifications, static file additions, and callback connections.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions modify local objects; no external data flows or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Sphinx theme, utilizing common modules and APIs. It manipulates local configuration objects, sets theme paths, and registers static assets without external inputs or outputs. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Sphinx theme configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a standard, safe setup script. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
