{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures a custom Sphinx documentation theme, setting theme paths, CSS, and JS files, and configuring theme options.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory path using os.path functions and reads version information from variables.",
  "sinks": "The code writes theme files and configuration options, and connects setup functions to the Sphinx application.",
  "flows": "The current directory path is obtained and used for theme configuration; setup functions modify the Sphinx app configuration and add static files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a Sphinx module, defines version variables, and implements functions to configure the Sphinx application. It uses standard path manipulations, appending CSS and JS files, and sets theme options. All operations are typical for Sphinx theme setup. No input/output flows suggest handling untrusted data, nor are there any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx theme setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages theme paths and static assets for documentation rendering.",
