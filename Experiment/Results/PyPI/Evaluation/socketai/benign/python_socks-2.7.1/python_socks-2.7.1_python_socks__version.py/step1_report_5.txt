  "anomalies": "Code only contains variable assignments for package metadata; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal set of metadata variables (__title__ and __version__) for a Python package. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be standard package metadata declaration, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only serves to set package information. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
