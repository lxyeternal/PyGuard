  "sources": "Assignment of package name and version variables (__title__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external data handling, or executable code present.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments are static; no data flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string variable assignments for package name and version, typical in Python package metadata. No functions, data flows, external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
