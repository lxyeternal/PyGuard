  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is only two variable assignments:\n```python\n__title__ = 'python-socks'\n__version__ = '2.7.1'\n```\nThere are no functions, data processing, external data interactions, or any other code constructs. The code is purely metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is minimal and only contains package metadata. They do not overlook any suspicious constructs or malicious indicators. The logical reasoning is sound, and no flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate because there is no malicious activity or code.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, reflecting high certainty based on the code snippet.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or malicious elements, there is no justification for increasing the malware or security risk scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as standard package metadata.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code present)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is purely metadata declaration, standard in Python packages, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.          |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No security issues or vulnerabilities evident.              |\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
