  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail.\n\n1. Code Content:\nThe code is:\n```python\n__title__ = 'python-socks'\n__version__ = '2.7.1'\n```\nThis is a minimal snippet setting package metadata variables, common in Python packages.\n\n2. Report Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code only assigns string literals to variables representing package name and version.\n- No functions, data flows, external data handling, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for package metadata.\n\n3. Logical and Security Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious indicators are present.\n- The absence of any data input/output, network activity, or code complexity supports the benign assessment.\n\n4. Scores and Justification:\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with the straightforward variable assignments.\n- Security risk: 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. Critical Review:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No report overestimates the risk; all correctly identify this as benign.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n\n6. Additional Considerations:\n- Since this is only a metadata declaration, it cannot be malicious unless combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions beyond the evidence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, harmless package metadata snippet with no security concerns.",
