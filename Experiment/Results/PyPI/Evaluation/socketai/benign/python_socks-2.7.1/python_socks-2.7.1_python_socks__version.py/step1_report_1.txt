  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'python-socks' library, including its name and version.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata; no unusual code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of two string assignments indicating the package name and version. There are no functions, data handling, or executable logic that could indicate malicious activity. The absence of suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, or external data interaction suggests no malicious intent. This appears to be standard package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
