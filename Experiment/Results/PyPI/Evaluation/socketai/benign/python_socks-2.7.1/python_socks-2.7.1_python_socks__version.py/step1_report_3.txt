  "purpose": "This code defines the package metadata for 'python-socks', likely part of a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code only assigns string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata, which is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal fragment setting package name and version variables. It contains no data processing, input/output operations, or executable logic. There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or external calls. Since it's only metadata, it does not pose security risks or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be boilerplate information typically found in Python package modules.",
