  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing proxy URLs and validating IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6).",
  "sources": "Parsing URL components (scheme, hostname, port, username, password) using urlparse; IP validation via regex matching on host input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input URL string -> urlparse -> extract scheme, hostname, port, username, password -> validate IP address if host is IP -> return parsed components.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out line in _is_ip_address function; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard regex patterns for IP validation, URL parsing with error handling, and straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The regex patterns are complex but standard for IP validation. The functions handle untrusted input cautiously, raising errors on invalid data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for proxy URL parsing and IP validation, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
