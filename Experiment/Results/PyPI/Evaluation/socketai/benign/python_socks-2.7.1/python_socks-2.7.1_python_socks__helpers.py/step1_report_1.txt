  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing proxy URLs and validating IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6).",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the URL string passed to parse_proxy_url and host input for IP validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system modification, or external communication. The code only parses and validates data.",
  "flows": "Input URL string -> urlparse -> extract scheme, hostname, port, username, password -> validation and parsing functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The IP regex patterns are complex but standard for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for IP address validation using regex patterns for IPv4 and IPv6. It parses proxy URLs to extract scheme, host, port, username, and password, raising errors on invalid input. No dynamic code execution, external system calls, or data exfiltration routines are present. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors. The validation methods and URL parsing logic are straightforward and standard for proxy configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for proxy URL parsing and IP validation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain backdoors, malware, or suspicious patterns.",
