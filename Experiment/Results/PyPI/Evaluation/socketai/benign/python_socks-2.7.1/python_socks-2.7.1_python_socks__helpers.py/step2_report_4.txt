  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides functions to parse proxy URLs (`parse_proxy_url`) supporting schemes: socks5, socks4, http.\n- Validates IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) using regex patterns.\n- Extracts username and password, unquoting them.\n- No dynamic code execution, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard regex and URL parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The IP validation regex patterns are complex but standard for such purposes.\n- No external data leaks, system modifications, or suspicious data flows are evident.\n- The commented-out line in `_is_ip_address` is benign and does not impact functionality or security.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No functional errors are apparent.\n- The only minor concern is the commented-out line:\n  ```python\n  # if host is None:\n  #     return False\n  ```\n  which was perhaps intended for earlier validation but is now commented out. This could lead to a situation where `host` is `None`, but since `parsed.hostname` can be `None`, the code does check for `not host` and raises an error, so this is not a security issue.\n- No input validation beyond parsing; however, this is typical for such utility functions.\n\n### Scores given by reports:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: high (~0.9-0.95)\n\nThese seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** The code is clear, with regex patterns and functions straightforward.\n- **Security risk (0.2):** Slightly elevated due to the potential for processing untrusted URLs and IP addresses, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The code processes untrusted input (proxy URLs) but does not execute or transmit data, so the risk remains low.\n- The regex patterns, while complex, are standard for IP validation.\n- No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility module for proxy URL parsing and IP validation, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is safe for use, with standard validation procedures.",
