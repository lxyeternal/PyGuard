{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for parsing proxy URLs and identifying IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6).",
  "sources": "URL input in parse_proxy_url() and the host string in _is_ip_address().",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted URL input processed in parse_proxy_url() and URL components parsed via urlparse().",
  "flows": "Input URL -> urlparse() -> host, port, scheme -> validation and extraction -> returned as tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Regex patterns are standard for IP validation. The code does not perform network actions or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of regex-based IP validation, URL parsing, and extraction of proxy details. It uses standard library functions and patterns for IP address validation and URL parsing, with no evident obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions handle typical inputs safely. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. The only notable aspect is the URL parsing, which could process untrusted URLs; however, this is typical for such utility functions and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for parsing proxy URLs and IP address validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use within a larger application that requires proxy configuration handling.",
