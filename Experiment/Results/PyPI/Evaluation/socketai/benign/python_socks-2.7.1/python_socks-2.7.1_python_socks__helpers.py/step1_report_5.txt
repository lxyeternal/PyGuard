{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing proxy URLs and identifying IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). It aims to validate and extract components from proxy URLs and IP addresses.",
  "sources": "URL input through the parse_proxy_url function; the hostname, username, and password fields from parsed URLs; the input to the IP address validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values of parse_proxy_url including proxy type, host, port, username, and password; the validation functions used internally to check IP address format.",
  "flows": "Input URL is parsed; host is extracted and validated; username and password are decoded and returned; IP validation functions determine if a host is an IP address.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or secret keys. The code contains commented-out lines that could indicate debugging or incomplete validation, but no malicious logic is present. The code performs standard URL parsing and IP address validation without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing with input validation for proxy URL schemes and components, including hostname, port, username, and password. The IP address validation uses regular expressions to identify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The commented lines are benign and typical for debugging. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected; the functions are straightforward and intended for legitimate URL processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for parsing proxy URLs and validating IP addresses. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network activity, or security risks. The overall design and implementation are standard, with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
