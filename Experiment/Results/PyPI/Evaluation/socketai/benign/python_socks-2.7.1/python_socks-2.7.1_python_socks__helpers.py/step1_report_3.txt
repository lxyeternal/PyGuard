{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and validate proxy URLs, identifying proxy type, host, port, and optional credentials.",
  "sources": "URL input in the function parse_proxy_url, and hostname components from urlparse.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code processes input and extracts data without executing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> urlparse -> extraction of scheme, hostname, port, username, password -> validation and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors; the regex patterns for IP addresses are standard. The commented-out code is benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses urlparse to extract URL components, validates proxy schemes, and handles IP address validation with regex. No suspicious or malicious logic is identified. The only potential concern is the absence of strict input validation beyond basic parsing, but it does not appear malicious. The commented-out code is harmless. No external network calls or data leaks are evident. The functions perform standard URL parsing and validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing proxy URLs, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It performs validation and extraction without executing untrusted code or leaking data. Overall security risk is low.",
