  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an async proxy chain handler with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trust in external proxy objects. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to deprecation and external dependencies."
