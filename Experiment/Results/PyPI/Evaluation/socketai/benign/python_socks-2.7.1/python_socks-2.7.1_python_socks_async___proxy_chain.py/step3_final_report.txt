{
  "purpose": "Implements an asynchronous proxy chain connector that sequentially connects through multiple proxies to reach a destination host and port.",
  "sources": "Proxy objects' connect method, proxy_host and proxy_port attributes within each proxy object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "Sequential calls to each proxy's connect method passing the current socket, ultimately connecting to the destination host and port.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning indicating outdated implementation; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, readable implementation of proxy chaining, relying on external proxy objects with a connect method. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The deprecation warning suggests the code should be updated but does not imply malicious intent. Security concerns depend on the trustworthiness of external proxies, not the code itself. No data leaks, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The logic is standard and safe within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an async proxy chain handler with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trust in external proxy objects. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to deprecation and external dependencies.",
