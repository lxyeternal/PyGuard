  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code defines three custom exception classes:\n- `ProxyError` extends `Exception` and adds an optional `error_code` attribute.\n- `ProxyTimeoutError` extends `TimeoutError`.\n- `ProxyConnectionError` extends `OSError`.\n\nThere are no dynamic behaviors, data flows, external interactions, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for error handling related to proxy operations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Are the reported issues present in the code?\n- **Presence of issues:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None. The code is standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n### Step 2: Are the scores appropriate?\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n### Step 3: Justify any higher scores\n- Since the code is benign, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n### Step 4: Are any claims based on assumptions?\n- No. All reports correctly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n### Step 5: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No changes are necessary.",
