  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code defines three custom exception classes:\n- `ProxyError`, which extends `Exception` and adds an optional `error_code` attribute.\n- `ProxyTimeoutError`, which extends `TimeoutError`.\n- `ProxyConnectionError`, which extends `OSError`.\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no data handling, no external interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The classes serve as custom exceptions for proxy-related error handling.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- There are no logical errors or security flaws in this code.\n- The design is standard and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n\n**Scores Given in Reports:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any runtime behavior, network activity, or data processing, scores for malware and obfuscation should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score is also correctly 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n- All reports agree on zero scores, which is consistent with the code content.\n- No changes needed here.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- The optional `error_code` attribute in `ProxyError` is a common pattern for richer error information.\n- The inheritance from built-in exceptions aligns with best practices.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard, and secure. No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
