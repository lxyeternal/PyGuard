  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for proxy-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class definitions do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are simple exception subclasses without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: ProxyError with an optional error_code attribute, and two subclasses, ProxyTimeoutError and ProxyConnectionError, inheriting from built-in exceptions. All classes are straightforward and do not include any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation present. The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes intended for handling proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
