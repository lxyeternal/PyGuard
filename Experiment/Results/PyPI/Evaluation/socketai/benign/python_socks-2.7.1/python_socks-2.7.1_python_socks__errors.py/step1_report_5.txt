  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for proxy-related errors to be used in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no potential for data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving sources to sinks; code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: ProxyError, ProxyTimeoutError, and ProxyConnectionError. ProxyError adds an optional error_code attribute, which is standard practice for custom exceptions. ProxyTimeoutError and ProxyConnectionError inherit from built-in exceptions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python conventions for exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for proxy errors with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
