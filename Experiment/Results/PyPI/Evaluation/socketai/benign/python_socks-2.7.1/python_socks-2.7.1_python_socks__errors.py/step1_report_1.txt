  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for proxy-related errors",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading in this code",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network, or file operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes: ProxyError, ProxyTimeoutError, and ProxyConnectionError. ProxyError extends Exception and adds an optional error_code attribute. The other two classes extend built-in exception types (TimeoutError and OSError). There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes intended for proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
