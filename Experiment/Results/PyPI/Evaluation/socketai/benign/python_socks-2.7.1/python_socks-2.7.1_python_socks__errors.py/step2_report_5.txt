  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes:\n     - `ProxyError`, which extends `Exception` and includes an optional `error_code` attribute.\n     - `ProxyTimeoutError`, which extends `TimeoutError`.\n     - `ProxyConnectionError`, which extends `OSError`.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no data handling, no network operations, and no hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for exception class definitions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly identifies that these are simple class definitions with no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious intent.\n   - The conclusions are consistent and reasonable based on the code provided.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, as there is no malicious activity, code, or behavior.\n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, given the benign nature of the code.\n   \n   Since the code is purely definitional and does not perform any operations beyond class declarations, all scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the code is only class definitions without runtime behavior or external interactions, which is accurate.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are based on assumptions; the code is simply structural.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the evidence, I agree with the current scoring and conclusions.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign and the reports are accurate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
