  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for proxy-related errors, including optional error codes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input or output; no runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and exception raising; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three simple custom exception classes: ProxyError with an optional error_code attribute, ProxyTimeoutError inheriting from TimeoutError, and ProxyConnectionError inheriting from OSError. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or network interactions. The code is standard, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is purely structural and follows best practices for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
