  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes:\n     - `ProxyError`, which extends `Exception` and includes an optional `error_code`.\n     - `ProxyTimeoutError`, which extends `TimeoutError`.\n     - `ProxyConnectionError`, which extends `OSError`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security and Malicious Indicators**:\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No external data, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n   - The exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as simple, benign, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - They explicitly mention the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate: the code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is safe.\n   - No report suggests any potential vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Discrepancies**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime data flow, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The only possible concern could be if these exception classes were used in a malicious context, but as standalone definitions, they are benign.\n   - No assumptions about future usage are warranted based solely on this code snippet.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for proxy error handling. All reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. No changes are necessary; the scores reflect the code's nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and straightforward.\n- The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
