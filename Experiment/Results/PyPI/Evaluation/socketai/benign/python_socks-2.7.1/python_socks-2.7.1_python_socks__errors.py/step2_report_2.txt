  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes:\n  - `ProxyError` with an optional `error_code` attribute.\n  - `ProxyTimeoutError` inheriting from `TimeoutError`.\n  - `ProxyConnectionError` inheriting from `OSError`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no network operations.\n\n**2. Logical and Security Review:**\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n- The `error_code` attribute in `ProxyError` is a common pattern for richer error information.\n- No external dependencies, data flows, or potential attack vectors are present.\n\n**3. Report Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**4. Potential Concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the `error_code` attribute could be exploited or misused. However, as it is an optional attribute stored in a class, and no malicious behavior is indicated, this is not a security concern.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is purely structural.\n\n**5. Final Assessment:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**6. Overall Risk and Scores:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the nature of the code.",
