  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for proxy-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No data output, external communication, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as there are no sources or sinks defined",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with standard exception class definitions; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: ProxyError with an optional error_code attribute, ProxyTimeoutError inheriting from TimeoutError, and ProxyConnectionError inheriting from OSError. All classes are standard and contain no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No external data, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The structure and content are typical for custom exception definitions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of custom exception classes for proxy errors, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
