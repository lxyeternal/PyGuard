  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different proxy types (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP).",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code is static and defines an enumeration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code solely defines an Enum class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a ProxyType enumeration with three members, representing different proxy protocols. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious logic. The structure is simple and conventional. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration definition for proxy types with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
