  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple enum definition for proxy types with no input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior. There are no errors, flaws, or malicious patterns in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Analysis of logic, reasoning, and summary:**  \n   Each report states that the code is a straightforward, standard enum declaration, which is accurate. They correctly note the absence of dynamic behavior, external data, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious intent or behavior is present.\n   - **SecurityRisk:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Confidence:** All are at 1 or 1.0, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential issues or claims of vulnerabilities:**  \n   No report claims or implies any vulnerabilities, exploits, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Consistency and reasonableness of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious features, the scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall assessment and recommendations:**  \n   Since all reports agree and the code is a standard enum declaration, I concur with their evaluations. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard enumeration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
