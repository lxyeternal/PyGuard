  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different proxy types",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading in this snippet)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or external data output in this snippet)",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward enum declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a simple enumeration ProxyType with three members: SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP, mapped to integer values 1, 2, and 3. There are no input/output operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or complex logic. The code appears to be a standard, minimal enum definition for proxy types without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves to categorize proxy types and does not perform any harmful actions.",
