  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different proxy types (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP).",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or sinks where data could be leaked or misused.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward enum definition with no unusual or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a simple enumeration class ProxyType with three members. There are no input, output, or dynamic elements. The code appears to be a standard and safe enumeration definition with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard enum definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
