  "purpose": "Define proxy types as an enumeration for categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; static enum definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static declaration without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enum class defining three proxy types with integer values. It contains no input/output, no data processing, no external dependencies, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity. There are no anomalies or suspicious features. The code's purpose is purely categorical, and it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
