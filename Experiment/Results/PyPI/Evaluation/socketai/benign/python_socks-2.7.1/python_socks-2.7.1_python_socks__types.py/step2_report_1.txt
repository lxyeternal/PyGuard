  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass ProxyType(Enum):\n    SOCKS4 = 1\n    SOCKS5 = 2\n    HTTP = 3\n```\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward enum definition, mapping proxy types to integer values.\n- There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external data sources or sinks.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No dynamic or runtime behavior that could introduce security risks.\n- The code appears to serve a simple categorization purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard, benign enum definition.\n- They note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are 0, aligning with the assessment that there's nothing malicious.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Are the issues present?**  \nNo. All reports agree that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n**Any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \nNo significant errors. The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n**Scores analysis:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are at maximum (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \nNo. All scores are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is minimal and static; no hidden or malicious behavior is plausible.\n- Since the reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard enumeration for proxy types with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and straightforward.\n- No modifications to scores or analysis are needed.\n- The reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the code's simplicity.",
