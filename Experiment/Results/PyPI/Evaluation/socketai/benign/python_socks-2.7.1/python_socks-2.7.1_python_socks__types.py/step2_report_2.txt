  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \nThe provided code snippet is a straightforward enum class defining three proxy types with integer values. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, no external input/output, and no obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Issue Presence**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple enumeration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and without security concerns.\n- They also correctly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Score Justifications and Recommendations**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\nGiven the above, I see no reason to adjust any scores. The assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are suggested.\n\n6. **Overall Estimation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard enum definition with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is safe and straightforward.  \n- The scores reflect this accurately.  \n- No further action needed.",
