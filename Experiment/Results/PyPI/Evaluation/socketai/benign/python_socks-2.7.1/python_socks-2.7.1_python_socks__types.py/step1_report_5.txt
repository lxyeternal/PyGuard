  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different proxy types",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external communications, or sensitive operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing pathways; simply defines an enum",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a simple enumeration class ProxyType with three members: SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP. There are no input sources, data flows, or external effects. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining an enum.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration definition with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns.",
