  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, static enumeration defining three proxy types: SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP.\n- All reports agree that there are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain obfuscation or complex logic.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Issue presence:** None of the reports identify any issues, anomalies, or suspicious behavior. The code is a minimal enum definition with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n- **Accuracy:** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a simple enum with no data flow, no input/output, and no suspicious features.\n- **Potential oversight:** The reports do not consider the possibility of malicious use if this enum is imported into a larger, potentially malicious, codebase. However, based solely on this snippet, the analysis is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores\n- **Confidence scores:** All reports have a confidence of 1 or 1.0, which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** All zero, which aligns with the conclusion that this code is benign.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed for the scores, as they are consistent and justified.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, and the code is purely definitional without any dynamic or external elements, these scores are appropriate.\n- **No justification needed for higher scores** because there is no evidence of malicious intent or security concern.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n- The code only defines an enum; no malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports assume that defining an enum is inherently safe, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code snippet; thus, no challenge is necessary.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static enum definition with no input/output, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No issues or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The overall risk is minimal; the code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as-is: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
