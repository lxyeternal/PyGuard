  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code simply imports `Enum` and defines `ProxyType` with three members mapped to integers.\n   - No input/output, no data processing, no external dependencies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard enum declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flows, external interactions, or potential vulnerabilities.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Malware scores are 0, consistent with no malicious activity detected or implied.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent.\n   - Since the code is a basic enum definition with no complex logic or external interactions, no higher risk scores are justified.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate; there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, given the code's transparency.\n\n4. **Potential for Assumptions or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scoring or interpretation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature and the reports' analyses.",
