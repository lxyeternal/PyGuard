{
  "purpose": "To expose package metadata, error classes, types, and helper functions related to proxy management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, _types, _helpers, _errors). No external or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; only defining exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard import and export patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to versioning, types, helpers, and error classes. It then defines an __all__ tuple to specify public API exports. All operations are standard module setup, with no data processing, no untrusted inputs, and no suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a typical package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely manages exports and internal imports without any suspicious or malicious code. It is safe based on the provided content.",
