{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initializer or module setup for a Python package, importing version info, types, helpers, and error classes, then defining what to export.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from internal modules (_version, _types, _helpers, _errors).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears standard for a package init module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information, types, helper functions, and error classes from internal modules, then defines __all__ to specify public API exports. There are no external inputs, no data handling, and no execution of untrusted data or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. It functions purely as a module interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and minimal security risk. It simply manages imports and exports within the package.",
