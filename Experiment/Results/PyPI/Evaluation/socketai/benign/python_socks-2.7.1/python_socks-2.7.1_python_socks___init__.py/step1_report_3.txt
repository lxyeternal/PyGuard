{
  "purpose": "The code imports version info, types, helpers, and error classes related to proxy handling, and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version, ._types, ._helpers, ._errors",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply re-exports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules. It does not execute any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The structure suggests typical module organization for a package related to proxy management. There are no apparent security risks or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module interface for a proxy-related package, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
