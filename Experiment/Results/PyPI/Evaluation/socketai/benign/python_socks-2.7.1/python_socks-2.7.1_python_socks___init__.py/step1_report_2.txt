{
  "purpose": "This code is used to import and expose certain attributes, classes, and functions from internal modules for external use, likely as part of a larger library or package related to proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version, ._types, ._helpers, and ._errors.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are only import and export statements without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard import and export statements without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version, title, types, helpers, and error classes from internal modules and then defines an __all__ list to specify what is exported when the package is imported. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no external network calls, and no data processing occurs here. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard package scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code for a Python module related to proxies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply re-exports internal components for external use.",
