  "purpose": "To define and export module-level variables, classes, and functions related to proxy handling, version info, and errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version, ._types, ._helpers, ._errors.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import/export statements, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version, type definitions, helper functions, and error classes from internal modules, then declares an __all__ list for exports. It is a standard module setup without any input handling, data processing, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected. It simply sets up the module's exports.",
