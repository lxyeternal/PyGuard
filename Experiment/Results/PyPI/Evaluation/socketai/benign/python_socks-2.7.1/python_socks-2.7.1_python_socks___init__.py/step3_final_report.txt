{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (_version, _types, _helpers, _errors)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Imports and exports only; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing internal modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and structure indicate benign intent, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
