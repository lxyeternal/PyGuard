  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports the 'ProxyChain' class from a local module '_proxy_chain' and exposes it via the '__all__' list for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '_proxy_chain' when importing 'ProxyChain'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'ProxyChain' from '_proxy_chain' during module initialization; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class and exposes it. No data flows, external inputs, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and follows standard practices. No security issues, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the lack of suspicious elements, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
