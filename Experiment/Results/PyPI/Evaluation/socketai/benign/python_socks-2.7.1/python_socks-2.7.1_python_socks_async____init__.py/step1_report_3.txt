  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simple import and export",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and exposes it via __all__. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The only action is a class import and export statement, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely to re-export a class for use elsewhere. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
