  "purpose": "Export the ProxyChain class from the current module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement from the internal module ._proxy_chain",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only exports an imported class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named ProxyChain from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package exports. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export with no malicious or security-related issues identified. It appears to be a normal part of a larger package's structure.",
