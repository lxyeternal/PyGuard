  "purpose": "Expose the ProxyChain class from the local module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ProxyChain from a relative module _proxy_chain",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of ProxyChain does not involve data flow; no source-to-sink flow evident",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and __all__ declaration; no anomalies or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. It imports ProxyChain from a local module _proxy_chain and exposes it for external modules. There are no input sources, data flows, or potentially dangerous operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is apparent. The module appears to be part of a package structure with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and only exposes a class from a local module. There is no malicious behavior or security concern detected based on this code fragment.",
