{
  "purpose": "The code exports the ProxyChain class for external use, likely part of a larger package related to network proxy chaining.",
  "sources": "The code imports the ProxyChain class from a relative module '_proxy_chain'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import flow is from _proxy_chain to this module; no data flow from external input to untrusted sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration to expose the class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a standard module export pattern typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
