  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs standard asynchronous DNS resolution using `getaddrinfo`.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n- The use of `await getaddrinfo` and sorting is standard practice.\n- No external effects, data leaks, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Asynchronous DNS resolver.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with a low security risk. The securityRisk score of 0.2 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but perhaps it accounts for the potential (though unlikely) misuse of DNS resolution in some attack scenarios. However, no such misuse is evident here.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as safe and straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 may be slightly high, but considering the function's purpose, it's acceptable as a conservative measure. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low, with some at 0.2; this is reasonable given the code's benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The securityRisk scores could be slightly lowered in some reports (e.g., from 0.2 to 0.1) to reflect the benign nature more accurately, but this is a minor point.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, given the code's purpose and behavior)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, legitimate asynchronous DNS resolver with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
