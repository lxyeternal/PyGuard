{
  "purpose": "Asynchronous DNS resolver for network address resolution, likely used in a networking or HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'host' and 'port' parameters for DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Returns resolved address information; no direct data leaks or external effect observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'host' and 'port' → 'getaddrinfo' call → processing of returned info → return of family and address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. Uses a standard socket library and async functions. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous resolver class that wraps around 'getaddrinfo' to perform DNS resolution for given host and port. It handles errors gracefully by raising an OSError if resolution fails. The use of 'await getaddrinfo' suggests asynchronous operation. No data exfiltration, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior is evident. No dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors, and no use of untrusted inputs in a malicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard asynchronous DNS resolution with appropriate error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be a legitimate component of a network client library.",
