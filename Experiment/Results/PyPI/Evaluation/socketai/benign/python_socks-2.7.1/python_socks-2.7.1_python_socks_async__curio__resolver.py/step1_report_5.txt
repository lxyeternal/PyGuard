  "purpose": "To asynchronously resolve hostnames to IP addresses using socket functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: host, port, and family in the resolve() method.",
  "sinks": "Awaited getaddrinfo call, which performs DNS resolution based on provided host and family.",
  "flows": "host input -> getaddrinfo() function -> returned address info -> extraction of address for return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async resolver class that calls getaddrinfo to resolve hostnames. It handles socket errors gracefully, sorts address info, and returns the address. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. Usage of standard socket functions and clear exception handling suggest normal operation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard hostname resolution asynchronously with proper error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a typical, safe implementation of an async DNS resolver.",
