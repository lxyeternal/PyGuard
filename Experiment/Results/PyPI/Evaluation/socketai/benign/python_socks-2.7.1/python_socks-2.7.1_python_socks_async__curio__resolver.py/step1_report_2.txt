  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous DNS resolver class that resolves hostnames to IP addresses using getaddrinfo.",
  "sources": "The host parameter in the resolve method, and the imported getaddrinfo function.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write untrusted data or invoke any sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input host to getaddrinfo, then process the returned address info for resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async resolver class that utilizes getaddrinfo to resolve hostnames asynchronously. It handles errors gracefully and sorts the address info before returning. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No external or untrusted inputs are used in unsafe ways, and the code adheres to normal DNS resolution patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard asynchronous hostname resolution without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
