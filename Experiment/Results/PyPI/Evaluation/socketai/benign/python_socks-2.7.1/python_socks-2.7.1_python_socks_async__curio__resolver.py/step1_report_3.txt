  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous DNS resolution functionality using the getaddrinfo method.",
  "sources": "Host input parameter in the resolve method.",
  "sinks": "getaddrinfo call, which resolves hostnames to IP addresses.",
  "flows": "Host input -> getaddrinfo -> resolution result -> returned address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of sorted to prioritize address types is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async resolver class that calls getaddrinfo to resolve hostnames. It handles errors by raising OSError if resolution fails. The code uses await for asynchronous resolution, sorts results to prioritize address families, and returns the address family and IP. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity, are present. The use of external library functions appears legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous hostname resolution without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger asynchronous networking framework.",
