  "purpose": "Asynchronous DNS resolver wrapping getaddrinfo to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: host, port, family; getaddrinfo call for DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input host and port flow into getaddrinfo, which returns address info; sorted and processed before returning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of getaddrinfo, proper error handling, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async DNS resolver using getaddrinfo from curio.socket. It handles socket.gaierror gracefully, sorts results, and returns address family and IP. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation detected. The import from curio.socket indicates use of an async socket library, which is legitimate. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of DNS resolution, but this is inherent to DNS functions and not indicative of malicious intent. Malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard async DNS resolver with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
