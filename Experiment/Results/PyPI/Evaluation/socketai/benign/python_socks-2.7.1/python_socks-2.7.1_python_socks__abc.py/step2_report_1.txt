  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code to assess potential security risks, malware presence, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code consists solely of abstract classes and method signatures for network resolvers and socket streams, both synchronous and asynchronous.\n- All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are placeholders meant to be implemented elsewhere.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, hardcoded secrets, or executable logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard interface layer, likely part of a larger framework or library.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All reports agree that the code is purely abstract interface definitions with no data handling, no execution logic, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** They all correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **obfuscated:** 0 — Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **malware:** 0 — Correct, no malware detected.\n- **securityRisk:** 0 — Correct, no apparent security issues.\n- **confidence:** 1 — Fully confident, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Justification**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is purely abstract and contains no malicious or risky content.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign interface definitions.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. Since there's no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is harmless and intended for extension.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. The code does not pose any security threat, so high risk scores are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe code is a set of standard, benign interface definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
