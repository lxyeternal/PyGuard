  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for synchronous and asynchronous network resolvers and socket streams.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read from external sources; the code only defines classes and method signatures.",
  "targets": "No direct targets or sinks are present; the code only declares method signatures without implementations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are present, as all methods raise NotImplementedError and contain no logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward abstraction layer with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely interface definitions for network-related components with no actual logic or data processing. It contains no input handling, data manipulation, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be a standard, harmless set of class definitions intended for extension or implementation elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard abstraction layer defining network resolver and socket stream interfaces. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
