  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for synchronous and asynchronous network resolvers and socket streams.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without data input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external interactions are implemented.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow; all methods are abstract and raise NotImplementedError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only contains class and method definitions with no executable or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes for network resolution and socket streams, with no implementation or runtime logic. It contains no data handling, no external connections, or dynamic code execution. The methods are placeholders intended for subclass implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code appears to be part of a larger framework or library infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign interface definition with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or other risky operations. Based solely on this, there are no security concerns.",
