  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes/interfaces for resolvers and socket streams for synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; this code only defines class structures and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. All methods are raising NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be overridden.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions with method signatures for resolver and socket stream interfaces. There are no actual implementations, data handling, or operations that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The code appears to be a standard interface declaration meant for further extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining abstract interfaces for network resolution and socket streams in both sync and async contexts. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be a benign setup for future implementation.",
