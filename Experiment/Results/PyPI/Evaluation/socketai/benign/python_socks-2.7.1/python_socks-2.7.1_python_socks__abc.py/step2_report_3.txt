  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of abstract class definitions with method signatures raising `NotImplementedError`. There are no implementations, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No input/output processing, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious activity or security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely abstract interfaces with no implementation or data handling, there is no basis for a higher risk score. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is just interface definitions with no vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, all indicating no malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code's simplicity and purpose as interface definitions mean it does not pose any security threat in its current form. Any security concerns would depend on how these interfaces are implemented and used, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious behavior, code is purely abstract interface definitions. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward class definitions.   |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No data handling, network activity, or vulnerabilities evident.     |\n\nThis is a benign, structural piece of code intended for extension. No further security concerns are warranted based on this snippet.",
