  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for synchronous and asynchronous network resolvers and socket streams.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "There are no executable data flows or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "All classes and methods are abstract with no implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides interface definitions for network-related components without actual implementation. It does not include data handling, input/output processing, or execution logic. No source-to-sink data flows or security risks are identifiable. The code appears to be a standard pattern for defining interfaces or abstract classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines abstract classes serving as interfaces for network resolvers and socket streams. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger system.",
