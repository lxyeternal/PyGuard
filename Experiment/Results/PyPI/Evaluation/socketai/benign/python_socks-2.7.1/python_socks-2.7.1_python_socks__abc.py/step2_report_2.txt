  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of abstract base classes with method signatures raising NotImplementedError.\n- No data input/output handling, no actual implementation, no network activity, and no data processing are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: defining interfaces for network resolvers and socket streams, both synchronous and asynchronous.\n\n**Assessment of the code's malicious potential:**\n\n- Since the code only contains class definitions with unimplemented methods, it does not perform any operations, including malicious ones.\n- The absence of data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution indicates no malicious behavior.\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining interfaces or abstract classes, which is common in large codebases or frameworks.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the lack of any executable or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\n- No implementation means no immediate security risk, but if an implementation were malicious, that would be outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The code's role as an interface layer means its security implications depend on the implementations that extend these classes, but the interface itself is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are justified.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard set of interface definitions with no malicious or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural and non-executable, with no security concerns.",
