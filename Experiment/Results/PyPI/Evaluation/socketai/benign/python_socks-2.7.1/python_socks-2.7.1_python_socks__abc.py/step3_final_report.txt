  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for network resolvers and socket streams, both synchronous and asynchronous, serving as a foundation for further implementation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method signatures; no data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating placeholders.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; abstract method signatures do not execute or process data.",
  "anomalies": "None; code contains only abstract class definitions with no implementation, data handling, or executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract classes with method signatures raising NotImplementedError, serving as interface definitions. There are no data inputs, outputs, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign, structural nature of the code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the absence of malicious or security-sensitive content. The high confidence score reflects certainty about the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of interface definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No further security concerns are warranted based on this snippet.",
