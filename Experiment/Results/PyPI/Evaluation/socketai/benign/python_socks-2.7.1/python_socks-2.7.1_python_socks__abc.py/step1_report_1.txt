{
  "purpose": "Defines interface classes for synchronous and asynchronous network resolvers and socket streams.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; all methods are abstract and intended to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; only class and method definitions with NotImplementedError.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes with method signatures for network resolution and socket stream operations, intended for extension. There are no data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The absence of concrete implementations limits potential malicious activity. No signs of hidden or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of interface definitions for network components, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as a foundation for further implementation, which must be reviewed separately for security issues.",
