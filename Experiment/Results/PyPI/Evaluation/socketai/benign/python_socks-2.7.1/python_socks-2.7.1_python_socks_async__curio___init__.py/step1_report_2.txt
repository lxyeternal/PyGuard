  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports a class named 'CurioProxy' from a local '_proxy' module and exposes it as 'Proxy' for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from the local module '_proxy' to import 'CurioProxy'.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import and re-export of a class. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. Without additional context about the '_proxy' module or 'CurioProxy', there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface to expose 'CurioProxy'. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
