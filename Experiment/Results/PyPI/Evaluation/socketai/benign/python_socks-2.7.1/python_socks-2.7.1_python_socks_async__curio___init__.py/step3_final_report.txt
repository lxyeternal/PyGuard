  "purpose": "This code imports the class CurioProxy from a local module and re-exports it as Proxy, serving as a simple interface for external modules.",
  "sources": "Import from ._proxy module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import occurs at module load; no data flows or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import and re-export pattern with no data processing, external inputs, or dynamic behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The import is straightforward, and the __all__ declaration exposes only the Proxy alias. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identified its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
