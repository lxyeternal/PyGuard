  "purpose": "Define and expose the 'Proxy' class imported from the '_proxy' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._proxy import CurioProxy as Proxy.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a straightforward import and export; no anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'CurioProxy' from a local module '_proxy' and assigns it the name 'Proxy', then exposes it via __all__. There are no indications of data input, external data handling, or other complex logic. The code appears to be a simple module setup without any malicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely re-exports a class from a local module, which is standard practice.",
