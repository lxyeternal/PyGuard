  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imported class 'CurioProxy' flows into the module's namespace as 'Proxy'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No external data or user input handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and exposes it under a different name in the module's public API. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data processing, no external data sources, and no potential attack vectors. The code's structure is straightforward and standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an alias or re-export of a class from a local module. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
