  "purpose": "Type definitions for the WorkDocs service API in Python, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it mainly defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code does not execute or handle external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; it is purely type annotation and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code strictly defines data types without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict definitions for various request, response, and metadata structures used in the AWS WorkDocs SDK. It conditionally imports typing features based on Python version, ensuring compatibility. The code uses no executable logic, no external data processing, and no potential malicious functions. It is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for better type safety and documentation. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The static nature of the code, along with the absence of code execution or network activity, indicates low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS WorkDocs SDK in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The overall malware score is 0, and security risk is very low. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the static and declarative nature of the code.",
