  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS WorkDocs SDK data structures, providing static type definitions for improved code clarity and type safety.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; static class and type definitions serve as schemas for SDK interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Purely declarative; no data flow or processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is to define data schemas for SDK interactions, not to perform runtime operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with its static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS WorkDocs SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores accurately reflect its static, declarative purpose.",
