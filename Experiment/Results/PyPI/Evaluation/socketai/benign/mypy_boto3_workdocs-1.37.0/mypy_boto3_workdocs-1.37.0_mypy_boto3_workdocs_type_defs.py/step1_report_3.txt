  "purpose": "Type definitions for WorkDocs service data structures to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code primarily defines TypedDict classes, constants, and imports that establish data schemas. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems, network, or file operations are present in this code. It is solely type definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows, input handling, or external data processing paths; this is purely schema definition code.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive use of type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and detailed schema definitions. No unusual or suspicious code constructs, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data types for the WorkDocs SDK, ensuring proper structure for API interactions. All classes are static type definitions without executable logic. The conditional imports are standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The use of 'sys.version_info' for compatibility is normal. No external data sources, external network connections, or credential handling code is present. No obfuscated or hidden code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code constitutes safe, non-malicious type definition schemas for the AWS WorkDocs SDK. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply defines data structures to be used elsewhere in the application or SDK.",
