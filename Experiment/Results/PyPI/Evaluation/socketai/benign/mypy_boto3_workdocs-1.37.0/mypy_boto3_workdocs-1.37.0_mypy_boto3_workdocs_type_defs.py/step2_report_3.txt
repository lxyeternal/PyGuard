  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is purely type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS WorkDocs SDK, with no runtime logic or executable components. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a static, schema-defining module. No evidence of malware, suspicious imports, or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type definitions with no external data processing or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No runtime logic, no dynamic code, no external inputs handled insecurely.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is static type definitions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No executable code or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type annotations for AWS SDK, with no runtime or external data handling.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type definitions for boto3's WorkDocs, with no runtime logic or external data processing.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code nature:** All reports correctly identify that this module is a static, declarative set of type annotations and data schemas for the AWS WorkDocs SDK.  \n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is justified given the static, non-executable nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.  \n- **Security risk:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation purposes.  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present.  \n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the analysis that the code is purely declarative, with no security concerns.**",
