  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to identify any security concerns, inconsistencies, or misalignments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static, type annotation module defining TypedDict classes for AWS WorkDocs SDK interactions.\n- It imports constants and types from external modules, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, runtime data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety, validation, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness & malicious activity:**  \n  The code appears purely declarative, with no runtime behavior. The type definitions are standard for SDKs, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Malware & obfuscation:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is not obfuscated, contains no malicious payloads, and is straightforward.\n\n- **Data flow & security risks:**  \n  Data flows from external API responses or user inputs into data structures, but these are mere definitions; no processing occurs here.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  Since the code does not execute, process untrusted data, or perform network operations, the likelihood of security vulnerabilities within this code is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious signs; code is benign type annotations.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** No external data processing; static data structures only.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Strictly type definitions; no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Pure type annotations, no runtime logic.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward type definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the absence of runtime logic, data handling, or network activity.\n\n**All reports are accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for the AWS WorkDocs SDK, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
