  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, anomalies, data flow, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is solely type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS WorkDocs SDK. No executable logic, no external data processing, no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static type definitions with no runtime or malicious components. The confidence is high, malware score is 0, and security risk is negligible.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only data structures and type annotations, with no external input processing or execution. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is static, purely declarative, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines static type structures for the SDK, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or malicious indicators. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's static nature and absence of executable or dynamic features confirm its benign intent.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. Malware score is 0, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type annotations for AWS WorkDocs, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no executable logic.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a schema, not executable, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** No concerns. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type definitions for boto3's WorkDocs, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious indicators.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is static, purely declarative, and designed for type checking.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. Malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is static type definitions with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for the AWS WorkDocs SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate type safety and documentation, with no executable or network components.\n\n---\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\nThis code is benign and standard for SDK type definitions.",
