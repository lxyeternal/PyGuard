  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a collection of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code relies on external literals for constrained field values, which is standard practice.\n- The purpose is to provide type annotations for AWS SDK interactions, not to perform any runtime operations.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS WorkDocs SDK.\n- **Flow & sinks:** Data flows from user/API inputs into data structures; no untrusted data is processed directly.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no suspicious or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Static, well-structured, no runtime or executable code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Fully benign. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for the WorkDocs API in Python.\n- **Flow & sinks:** No untrusted data processing, no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None; purely type annotations.\n- **Analysis:** Static data schemas, no executable logic, no malicious patterns.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for data structures in WorkDocs.\n- **Flow & sinks:** No data flows from untrusted sources; static definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis:** Static type schemas, no runtime code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for API payloads.\n- **Flow & sinks:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None; purely declarative.\n- **Analysis:** Static type definitions, no executable logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; safe code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for boto3 WorkDocs.\n- **Flow & sinks:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard type definitions.\n- **Analysis:** Static, declarative, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is purely static type definitions, with no executable logic, no external data processing, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent and appropriate.\n- The confidence is high, given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for the AWS WorkDocs SDK, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
