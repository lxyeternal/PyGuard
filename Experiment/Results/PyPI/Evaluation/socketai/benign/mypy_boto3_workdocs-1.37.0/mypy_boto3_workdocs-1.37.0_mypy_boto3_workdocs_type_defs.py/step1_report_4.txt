  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the workdocs service API, used for static type checking and ensuring correct data structures in Python code interacting with AWS WorkDocs.",
  "sources": "Defines data structures (TypedDicts) for request and response payloads, including input parameters and metadata; imports external types and standard libraries for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing or insecure handling; no network, file, or external command execution code present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; only static type definitions without dynamic code or data manipulation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. All code consists solely of type definitions and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type annotations and data structure definitions, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no executable statements, no data processing, and no external data sources or sinks. It appears to be a static type hinting module for AWS WorkDocs SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static type definitions for the AWS WorkDocs SDK in Python. There is no malicious behavior, no dynamic or network activity, and no security risks associated with the provided code. It serves purely as a schema for type checking.",
