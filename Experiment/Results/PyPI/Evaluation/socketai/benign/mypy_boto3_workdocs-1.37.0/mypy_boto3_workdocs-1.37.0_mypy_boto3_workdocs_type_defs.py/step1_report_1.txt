  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS WorkDocs service, used for data validation and type safety in SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from literals module; user inputs for various request payloads; internal data structure assignments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data inputs from API calls or user parameters that populate request fields; outputs are mostly data structures returned from API responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or external API responses into internal data structures; no explicit flow of untrusted data into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. Use of optional (NotRequired) fields and type annotations appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines typed dictionaries for request and response data structures for the AWS WorkDocs SDK. It imports literals for constrained field values and uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no runtime or executable components, only type and data structure definitions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a standard, benign type definition module. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the comprehensive coverage of data types and optional fields, which aligns with SDK design but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for the AWS WorkDocs SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as a schema definition, with no runtime or executable behavior.",
