{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the WorkDocs service in boto3, facilitating type checking and code clarity for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports, system version info, and predefined constants and types. No external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code is solely defining type annotations and data structures without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code strictly defines data structures using TypedDict, conditional imports for compatibility, and type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of type definitions for the WorkDocs API in boto3, with compatibility handling for different Python versions. It imports necessary types and defines numerous TypedDict classes for API request and response structures. There are no executable statements, external data processing, or potential entry points for malicious activity. The presence of licensing and documentation comments is standard. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic or data processing that could harbor malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign set of type definitions for boto3's WorkDocs service. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Its purpose is to enhance static type checking and developer clarity. Overall security risk is negligible.",
