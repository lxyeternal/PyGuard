  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions, with no executable logic, external data processing, or network activity. The code is a set of TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n   No report points out any logical errors, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. They all correctly identify that the code is standard, static, and intended for type hinting.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscation, and risk:**  \n   - Malware score: all reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n   - Obfuscated: all assign 0, as there's no obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n   - Security risk: all assign 0, given the static, benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent, emphasizing the code's role as a schema and type annotations.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS WorkDocs SDK in Python.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as a schema for type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior or code present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n- **Risk score:** **0** — static type definitions pose no security risk.\n\n### Final justification:\nThe code is static, declarative, and standard for SDK type annotations. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any executable logic that could be exploited. The comprehensive use of TypedDict and conditional imports is typical for maintaining compatibility and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
