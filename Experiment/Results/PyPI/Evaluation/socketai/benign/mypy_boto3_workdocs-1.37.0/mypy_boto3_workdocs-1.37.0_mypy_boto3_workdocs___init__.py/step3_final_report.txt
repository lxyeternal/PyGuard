{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports classes and functions related to the AWS WorkDocs SDK, sets up an alias, and defines the public API via __all__. It also includes documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules (.client and .paginator) during import time to load classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static imports and exports; no runtime data flows from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions from internal modules, assigns an alias, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains a detailed docstring with usage instructions and documentation links. No dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is typical for an SDK interface layer, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The future date in the copyright is unusual but not malicious. The assigned scores in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are appropriate, and the low risk score is justified. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
