  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring, and the security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions from internal modules (.client and .paginator), defines an alias, and sets up the __all__ export list.\n- It includes a detailed docstring with usage instructions and documentation links.\n- No data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution occurs within this code.\n- The code appears to serve as an SDK interface layer, primarily for organizational and re-export purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import/export module with no malicious or vulnerable behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct, and the logic is straightforward. The only minor anomaly is the copyright date set in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a very low or zero risk score, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a benign SDK interface module with no security concerns.\n- The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The detailed documentation and import structure do not introduce any security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- The code is a standard SDK interface setup, with no external data handling or dynamic execution.  \n- The future date is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is safe, well-structured, and free from security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
