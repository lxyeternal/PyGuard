  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are appropriate, and the low risk score is justified. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
