{
  "purpose": "Provides interface and imports for the WorkDocs service client and related paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator). No external input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources. No data leak or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external or untrusted sources to sinks; primarily module imports and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions to set up a client interface for the AWS WorkDocs service. The only dynamic element is the creation of a client instance and the usage of paginators for various AWS API calls, which are standard in SDK-based code. There are no user inputs, environment variable usages, network calls, or code execution features that could be exploited maliciously. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical of SDK module setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup module for AWS SDK clients related to WorkDocs. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and purely structural, serving as an interface for other parts of the application.",
