  "purpose": "This code provides the main interface and import structure for a WorkDocs service client, including paginators and documentation references.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator) and static string literals in comments and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; primarily imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines and exports classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The copyright date is set in the future (2025), which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and defines an alias 'Client'. It includes a detailed documentation string with example usage. No input/output handling, network connections, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flow are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for a boto3-based WorkDocs client library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It primarily facilitates access to AWS WorkDocs functionalities through structured imports.",
