{
  "purpose": "Define the version of the package as a static string, serving as the source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version declaration with a docstring comment. It contains only a static string assignment to __version__, with no external dependencies, input handling, or obfuscation. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
