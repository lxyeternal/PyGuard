  "purpose": "Define and store the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring comment about the source of truth for versioning, followed by a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. There are no dynamic or obfuscated elements, no input reading, and no data transmission or sensitive data handling. This is a typical version declaration pattern with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It serves a simple purpose of version tracking.",
