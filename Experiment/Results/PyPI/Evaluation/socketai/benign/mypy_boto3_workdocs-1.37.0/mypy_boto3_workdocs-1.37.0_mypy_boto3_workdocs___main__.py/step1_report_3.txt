  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. Code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for command-line argument handling. It defines two functions to output static information about the package and its version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and displays appropriate info. The script executes main() if run directly. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static package information. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It is a benign and straightforward script.",
