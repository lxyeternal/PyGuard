  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output data)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (writes to stdout), reading sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> main() -> conditional check -> print_version() or print_info() -> sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The printed information is static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code functions solely as a CLI interface, printing static package information and version data. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version info or package info, then writes output to stdout. There are no external data sources, no user inputs beyond command-line args, and no suspicious network activity or data handling. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and only performs informational printing, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple informational CLI tool with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no signs of sabotage or malware. It appears to be safe and purely informational.",
