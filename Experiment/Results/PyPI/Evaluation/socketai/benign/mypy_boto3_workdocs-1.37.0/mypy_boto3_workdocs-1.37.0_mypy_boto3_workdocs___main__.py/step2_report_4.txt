  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Logical Consistency:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version` and writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No dynamic data, external network calls, or data processing occurs.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only prints static information and has no external dependencies or network activity.\n   - No report claims or implies any vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware Consideration:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static strings, there is no malware or malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - No suspicious or obfuscated code, no external data, no network activity.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports are based on static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is correct given the code.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and reports.\n   - The reports are thorough and align with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My personal estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and no security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, straightforward CLI utility that displays static package info, with no security concerns.",
