  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only `sys`, uses straightforward functions, and performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The logic is clear, minimal, and typical for an informational CLI script.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only outputs static information, with no external data handling, network calls, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues detected. The code is a straightforward CLI info display.\n   - The reports are consistent and justified.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on observable code behavior.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static informational CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
