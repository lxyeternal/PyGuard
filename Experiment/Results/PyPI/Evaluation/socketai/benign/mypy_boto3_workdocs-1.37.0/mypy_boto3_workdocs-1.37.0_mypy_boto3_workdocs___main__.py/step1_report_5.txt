  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 WorkDocs stub and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing info and version details",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments (sys.argv) -> conditional checks -> output via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No external network calls or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information about the package. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version info or package details, then writes static text to stdout. No untrusted data processing, no external requests, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The code is minimal, well-structured, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs static information based on command-line input. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
