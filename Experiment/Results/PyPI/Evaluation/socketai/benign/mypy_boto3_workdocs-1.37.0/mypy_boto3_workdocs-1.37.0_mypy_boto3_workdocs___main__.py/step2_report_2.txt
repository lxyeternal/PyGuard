  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores:\n\n**1. Code Presence and Functionality:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on command-line argument `--version`.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no dynamic data, network activity, or external data handling.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n- The logic is straightforward and correct: checking for `--version` and printing accordingly.\n- No errors or flaws are evident; the code is minimal and functions as intended.\n\n**3. Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely informational, static, and has no suspicious behaviors, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscation Concerns:**\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present; the malware score remains at 0.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign, static CLI utility.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
