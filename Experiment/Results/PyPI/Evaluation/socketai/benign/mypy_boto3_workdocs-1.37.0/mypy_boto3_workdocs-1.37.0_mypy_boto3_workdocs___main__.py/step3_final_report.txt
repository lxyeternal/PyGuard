  "purpose": "Provides static package info and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to either print_version or print_info output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line input. It performs no dynamic data handling, network activity, or external data processing. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The logic is minimal and correct, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident. All signals indicate benign, static code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
