  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 WorkDocs and its version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "User provides '--version' argument, triggering print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI arguments to display package info or version details. It imports only the sys module, uses straightforward conditional logic, and outputs static strings. No user input is processed beyond argument checking. The code does not include network activity, file operations, or data leaks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The structure is simple and standard for CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI entrypoint that displays package information based on user input. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
