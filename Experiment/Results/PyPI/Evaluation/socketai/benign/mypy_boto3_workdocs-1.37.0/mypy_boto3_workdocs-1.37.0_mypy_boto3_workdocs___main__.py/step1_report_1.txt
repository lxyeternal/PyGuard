  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 WorkDocs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdout.write() to output package info and version details.",
  "flows": "Command-line input triggers print_version() or print_info(), which output static strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data. No use of unsafe functions or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution, network calls, or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple CLI utility functions that print static information about the package. It checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to display. All data is hardcoded and there are no external data sources or sinks that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The structure is straightforward and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a static info display tool, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities present.",
