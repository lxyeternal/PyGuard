  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-workdocs package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata; import statements; setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools for package setup. It reads a README file for long description content. All data used for package configuration are static strings or file reads; there is no processing of external or untrusted input. The dependencies and metadata are fixed, and no code executes external commands or network operations. The code appears typical for a Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It only manages package metadata and dependencies without involving any external or untrusted data sources.",
