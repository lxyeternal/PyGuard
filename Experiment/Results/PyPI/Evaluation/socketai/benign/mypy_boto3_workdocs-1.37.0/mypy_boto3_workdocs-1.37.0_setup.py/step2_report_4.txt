  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess their accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python setup script for the package `mypy-boto3-workdocs`.\n- The code reads a local README.md for long description, imports `setuptools`, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports conclude that the script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is straightforward and matches typical Python packaging scripts.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no external data, no code injection, no obfuscated code.\n- **Data flow:** Only static data and filesystem reads are involved; no untrusted sources or data sinks.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware:** None detected.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The only dynamic operation is reading `README.md`, which is standard.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The `install_requires` line with environment markers is standard.\n\n### Scoring assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a typical setup script with no external or untrusted data processing, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- All reports correctly assign a risk score of 0.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe script is a standard, static setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It reads a local file for description and sets package metadata, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no security threats. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
