  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- It defines static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- It uses only standard modules (`pathlib`, `setuptools`) with no dynamic code execution.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The code appears safe, legitimate, and conventional.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the script as a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that no untrusted data, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- They assign a security risk score of 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Confidence is high (1.0), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or flaws are noted.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified, given the static, safe nature of the script.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk should be 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final expert estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security threats. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed no issues in the code.\n- No anomalies, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe and legitimate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as-is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
