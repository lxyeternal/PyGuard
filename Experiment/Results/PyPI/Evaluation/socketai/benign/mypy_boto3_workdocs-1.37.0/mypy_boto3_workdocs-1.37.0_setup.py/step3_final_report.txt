  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-workdocs, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static strings for metadata; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README.md file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It uses only static data and filesystem reads, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted input. The code is clear, readable, and follows standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate a benign, safe package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe Python package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
