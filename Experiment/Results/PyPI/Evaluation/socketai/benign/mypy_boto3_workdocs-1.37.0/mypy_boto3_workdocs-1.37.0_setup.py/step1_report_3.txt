  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-workdocs package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static package metadata, and dependencies from hardcoded strings and filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data at runtime; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README.md file as a source to include as long description; no data flows from external untrusted sources into the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script importing 'setuptools' for package configuration. It reads a README.md file for the long description, specifies package details, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. All data used is static or filesystem-based, with no suspicious logic. The dependencies are straightforward and properly versioned. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate and typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
