  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their claims, the presence of issues, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes a type annotation/interface for the WorkDocs client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external data flows beyond method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies this as a static interface, primarily for type safety, with no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that this is a legitimate SDK interface is justified. Confidence is high (1), malware risk is 0.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — justified, as it's a pure interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar; type annotations for API interaction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially accept untrusted input via kwargs, but this is standard for SDK clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No embedded malicious code; boilerplate style.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is a boilerplate interface, with no malicious payload.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, reflecting standard SDK usage; acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK stub with extensive type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; methods are signatures, not implementations.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states this is a well-structured type stub with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified; high confidence, no malware.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; type annotations for SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses kwargs and URL generation, typical for SDK clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or code.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately describes this as a type stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, with high confidence.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method signatures, URL generation, typical SDK operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies this as a legitimate, safe SDK interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious elements; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — acceptable, as it’s a typical SDK client.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the fact that these are SDK interfaces accepting untrusted input, but not inherently risky or malicious.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reported scores. The code is a static, type-safe SDK interface with no runtime logic, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (due to potential misuse, but not inherently risky)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk score is justified, reflecting the typical nature of SDK wrappers that handle untrusted input but do not contain malicious code themselves.",
