{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 WorkDocs client, providing structured method signatures and exception handling for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting kwargs, type definitions, and URL generation functions; no external data sources or runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacked from predefined types; URL generation for presigned URLs; no untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into API method calls; no active data processing or external communication beyond standard SDK behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; static interface with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS WorkDocs, with method signatures, properties, and overloads. It does not perform data processing, external calls, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The use of kwargs and URL generation is standard for SDK wrappers. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface stub with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. It serves as a static type-safe wrapper for AWS WorkDocs API interactions.",
