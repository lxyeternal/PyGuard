{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the Amazon WorkDocs service, providing type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, botocore, and internal type definitions; method definitions including parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "None evident. The code primarily defines an interface and data types, with no direct data handling or external calls beyond method signatures.",
  "flows": "Method signatures with unpacked kwargs from predefined type definitions, returning typed responses; no actual runtime data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a structured interface with extensive type annotations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static interface definition for the boto3 WorkDocs client, including type annotations for method parameters and responses, and property/method signatures for interacting with the service. It imports necessary types, defines a custom exception class, and a client class with methods corresponding to API actions. No runtime logic, data handling, or external calls are present. The use of 'Unpack' with detailed type definitions suggests static type checking rather than dynamic execution. The overall structure aligns with standard SDK interface definitions, and no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a type-safe interface for the boto3 WorkDocs client, providing clear method signatures and type annotations. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface without malicious elements or suspicious behavior.",
