  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a type annotation and interface for the WorkDocs client. No runtime logic, only type definitions and method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, no external calls, just interface definitions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** This is a standard SDK interface, purely static, with no malicious elements.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above—type annotations for the WorkDocs client, with detailed method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept kwargs, potentially from untrusted sources, but this is typical for SDK interfaces.  \n- **Anomalies:** No embedded malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, boilerplate SDK interface, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. No security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type stub for the WorkDocs client, with method overloads, properties, and type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Unpack kwargs for API calls, URL generation for presigned URLs—standard behavior.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external code execution.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious intent.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, aligned with the content.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Interface definition for WorkDocs, with method signatures and type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to above, kwargs unpacked for API requests, URL generation.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, safe and legitimate.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, fitting the description.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type-safe wrapper for the WorkDocs client, with methods, properties, and URL generation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method inputs from kwargs, URL creation—typical for SDK clients.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard SDK interface code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.1 (securityRisk) and 0 (malware) are consistent with a typical SDK interface that interacts with external services but contains no malicious payload.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that this is an interface/stub code for the boto3 WorkDocs client.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0 or very low, which is correct given the static, interface-only nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Zero or near-zero, appropriate for SDK interface code with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear, structured, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the absence of any active malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured type stub/interface for the AWS WorkDocs SDK. It is safe, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain risk score at 0, as this is purely an SDK interface.  \n- No further action needed unless runtime code or data handling is introduced.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
