{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for Amazon WorkDocs service, providing methods to interact with WorkDocs resources via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and function implementations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, property accesses, and URL generation functions that could potentially handle untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (kwargs) unpacked into request types, which then invoke network calls; generate_presigned_url creates URLs for resource access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; all code follows standard boto3 client wrapper structure; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly-typed wrapper class for the boto3 WorkDocs client, including method signatures, exception definitions, and pagination overloads. It primarily provides an interface to AWS services with type safety and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No untrusted data handling or unsafe code practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured boto3 wrapper for Amazon WorkDocs with type annotations. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate SDK interface code for AWS service interaction.",
