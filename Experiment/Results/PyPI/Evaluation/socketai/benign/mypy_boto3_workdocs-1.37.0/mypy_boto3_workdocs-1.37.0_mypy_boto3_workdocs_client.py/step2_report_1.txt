  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the provided code with their conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations and interface for the WorkDocs client.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, data handling, or external calls; purely interface definitions. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Clearly 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes type annotations and API interface.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No executable logic, no data leaks, no obfuscation. Potential concern about passing untrusted data, but this is standard for SDK clients.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. No malicious intent, just boilerplate SDK code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0 malware, minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on type safety and API definitions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard use of Python typing, overloads, and method signatures.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. No signs of backdoors or malware.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0 malware, no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar interface and type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Use of '**kwargs' and 'generate_presigned_url' is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. It's a type stub for SDK interaction.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0 malware, no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous reports—SDK interface.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dangerous data handling. URL generation and method signatures are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0 malware, minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a static, type-annotated interface for the boto3 WorkDocs client.\n- **Behavior & Risks:** No executable logic, no external code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Purpose:** To provide type safety, documentation, and structured API signatures—likely auto-generated or boilerplate.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely interface/type annotations with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface stub for AWS WorkDocs, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
