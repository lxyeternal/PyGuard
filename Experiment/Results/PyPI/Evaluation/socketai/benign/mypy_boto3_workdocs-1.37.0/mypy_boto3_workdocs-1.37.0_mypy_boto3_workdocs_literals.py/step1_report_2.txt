{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various enumerations used in the boto3 workdocs service for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string constants used in type annotations; no runtime input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple literal type definitions, some with common or generic string values; no obvious malicious code or behavior. The code contains a copyright notice and version-dependent imports, which are standard for type definition files.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for string constants as Literal types, aiding static type checking. It uses conditional imports to support different Python versions, which is common practice. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling. No dynamic code execution, network access, or other suspicious activities are present. The overall structure is straightforward and solely for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type definitions for enum-like string literals used in the boto3 workdocs client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign type annotation module.",
