{
  "purpose": "Defines static string literals for AWS WorkDocs service constants to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type annotations without runtime data processing or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard static type declaration pattern, conditional import for compatibility, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of string literal type definitions for AWS WorkDocs constants. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal', which is common for compatibility. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data, or runtime logic. The code serves as a type hinting aid and does not pose any security risks or contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type declaration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
