{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for boto3 workdocs service integration, facilitating type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines literals and imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow logic or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard type annotations and conditional import for compatibility, nothing unusual or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for string literals used within the boto3 workdocs service, including activity types, paginator names, resource types, and others. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime data manipulations; it solely defines constants for type safety. No malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The purpose is purely to improve static type checking, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign type definitions module for boto3 service integration, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a static typing aid and contains no executable or data-handling code that could be exploited.",
