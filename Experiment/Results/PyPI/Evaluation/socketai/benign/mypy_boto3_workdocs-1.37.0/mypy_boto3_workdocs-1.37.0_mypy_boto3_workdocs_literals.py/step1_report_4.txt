  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS WorkDocs service constants and related enumerations, primarily for type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions of string constants used as type annotations for AWS API parameters and responses.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines static literal types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; straightforward type alias definitions using Literal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines numerous Literal type aliases for AWS WorkDocs and other AWS service constants. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The code strictly provides type annotations for static analysis and does not perform any runtime actions or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern could be unnecessary dynamic import based on version, but this is a standard compatibility pattern. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static declaration of string literal types for type annotations, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a utility module for type safety in AWS SDK usage.",
