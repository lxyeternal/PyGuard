  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS WorkDocs service and related enumerations to support type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based enums, imported sys module to check Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, data output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None present; the code only defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; standard pattern for type annotations. The import of 'sys' for version check is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of string literal type definitions used for type annotations in boto3 AWS SDK stubs. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a standard practice. The definitions are extensive but purely declarative, serving as enums for various AWS resources and operations. There are no inputs, outputs, or external calls that could be exploited or malicious. The code appears to be auto-generated or maintained as part of a SDK stubs package for type checking support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely providing type annotation literals for AWS SDK support. There is no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risk present.",
