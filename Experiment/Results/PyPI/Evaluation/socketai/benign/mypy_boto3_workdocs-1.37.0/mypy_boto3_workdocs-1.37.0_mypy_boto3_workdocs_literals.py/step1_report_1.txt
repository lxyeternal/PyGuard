{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for various constants used in the boto3 WorkDocs service for type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "The literals are assigned directly as variables with string values; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows or input-output paths involving untrusted sources are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type literal definitions, which are standard and benign. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations using Python's Literal type for a large set of predefined string constants related to AWS WorkDocs and other services. The import logic adapts based on Python version for compatibility, which is standard. No external data, user input, or network operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected; the code appears to serve as a static type definition module. All literals are standard strings representing AWS service constants, with no embedded or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static type declaration module with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to improve type safety and IDE support for AWS WorkDocs API constants.",
