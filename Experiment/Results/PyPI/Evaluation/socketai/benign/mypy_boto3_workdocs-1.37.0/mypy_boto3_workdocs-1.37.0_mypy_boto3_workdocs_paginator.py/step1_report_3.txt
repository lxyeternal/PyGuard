{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS WorkDocs service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted data; it primarily imports modules and defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data, execute commands, or perform network operations; it only defines paginator classes with no internal data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the paginate methods only define signatures without executing any logic or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present. The code uses standard Python typing, conditional imports, and class definitions. The license statement mentions 2025, which appears inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a type annotation and class definition module for AWS SDK paginators. It imports standard modules and conditional typing extensions, defines several paginator classes with method signatures, and includes documentation links. There are no indications of code injection, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns. The presence of a future timestamp (2025) in the license may suggest placeholder or outdated info but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation module for AWS SDK paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and purely declarative, serving to improve type safety for SDK usage.",
