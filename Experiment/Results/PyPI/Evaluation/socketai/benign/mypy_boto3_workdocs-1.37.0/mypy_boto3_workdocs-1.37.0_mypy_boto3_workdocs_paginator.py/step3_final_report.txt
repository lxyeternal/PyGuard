  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS WorkDocs client paginators, providing static type hints for paginator classes and their methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, local type_defs module, and conditional import of Unpack based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; methods accept kwargs for pagination parameters but do not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'paginate' methods which return PageIterator objects; no external data processing or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version; license year noted as 2025, which appears inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated module defining paginator classes for boto3's WorkDocs service. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The classes inherit from Paginator, with 'paginate' methods accepting pagination parameters and returning PageIterator objects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution are present. The only minor anomaly is the license year '2025', likely a placeholder or typo. All evidence points to this being a benign, structural type stub intended for static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign set of type annotations for AWS SDK paginators, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves solely as a static type hinting aid, and the overall security assessment is that it is safe and non-malicious.",
