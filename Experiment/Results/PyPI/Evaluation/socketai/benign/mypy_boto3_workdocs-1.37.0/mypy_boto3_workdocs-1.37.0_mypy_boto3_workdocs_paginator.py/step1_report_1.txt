{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS WorkDocs client with type annotations for use with boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class and method definitions; dynamic type assignment based on type checking.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; no code executes external commands, writes files, or handles user input directly.",
  "flows": "Method 'paginate' receives **kwargs with type Unpack[...TypeDef], returning PageIterator of response types; no external data flows or malicious data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. Use of dynamic typing and conditional imports is standard for version compatibility, not malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, type-annotated definition of paginators for the AWS WorkDocs service, intended for static type checking and documentation. It imports relevant modules, defines classes extending Paginator with 'paginate' methods, and uses conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a type stub package, serving as a thin, well-structured wrapper around boto3 paginators with added type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign type stub implementation for AWS boto3 paginators. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely for type checking and IDE support. The malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
