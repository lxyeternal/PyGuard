{
  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for the WorkDocs service client with type annotations for better static analysis and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module. Also, class methods that call 'paginate' which internally invoke the paginator's built-in method.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods, which accept untrusted keyword arguments, potentially passing external data into paginator calls.",
  "flows": "User provides kwargs to 'paginate', which are unpacked and passed into the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method, producing a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, no network operations, no data leaks, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of paginator wrapper classes for the boto3 WorkDocs client with type annotations. It imports type definitions and extends the Paginator class, overriding 'paginate' to add type hints. The conditional import of 'Unpack' is for Python versions >= 3.12. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or credential handling. No malicious patterns or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of paginator class definitions aimed at enhancing static type checking and code clarity for boto3 WorkDocs operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
