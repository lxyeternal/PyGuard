{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations such as computing distances, courses, and propagating points on Earth's surface using spherical geometry formulas.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, notably p0, p1, angle, and distance d.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks; it returns calculated numerical outputs without external data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted into numpy arrays, processed with mathematical operations, and the results are returned. No untrusted data flows into external systems or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Functions use standard mathematical formulas for geodesic calculations; no obfuscated or misleading code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geographic calculations based on spherical Earth assumptions. It converts inputs to numpy arrays, applies trigonometric formulas, and returns distances, bearings, or propagated points. The functions rely on numpy's math functions for computations and include input validation and conversion logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden code. All mathematical formulas are standard for geographic calculations and do not involve external network calls or system commands. The code is clean, well-structured, and contains only legitimate mathematical processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate geographic utility library with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard calculations for distances, bearings, and point propagation on Earth's surface without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
