{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations on Earth's surface, including distance, course, and propagation functions based on latitude and longitude coordinates.",
  "sources": "Reads input points (p0, p1) and parameters such as degree flag, distance, and angles. Uses functions like _to_arrays to process input data.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations that involve trigonometric functions and array manipulations. No untrusted data outputs or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs (coordinates, angles, distances) are processed and transformed through mathematical functions without external data transmission. No evidence of data leaking or external network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Uses standard scientific libraries (numpy) without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No unusual behavior or obfuscated code features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements geographic calculations using well-known formulas for distance, bearing, and position propagation on a sphere. Functions handle both scalar and array inputs, applying numpy vectorized operations. The implementation relies on standard mathematical approaches with no hidden code or malicious logic. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The overall structure and purpose are consistent with a geographic utility library, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate geographic computation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard mathematical formulas and numpy functions without any suspicious behavior. Overall, it is safe and not malicious.",
