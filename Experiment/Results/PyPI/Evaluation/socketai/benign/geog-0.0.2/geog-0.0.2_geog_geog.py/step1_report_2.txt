{
  "purpose": "This code provides geospatial calculations on Earth's surface, including distance, course, and propagation of points based on spherical Earth models.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: p0, p1, angle, d, which are points, angles, and distances provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions contain data sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or leak data. The code performs mathematical calculations locally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into conversion functions, then into mathematical functions (trigonometric calculations) within each method. There are no external data flows or untrusted data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard mathematical and numpy operations. No hidden backdoors or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements geospatial calculations for Earth's surface using standard formulas (haversine, bearing, destination point calculations). It correctly handles array inputs and conversions, with no signs of malicious intent. Functions are straightforward, with no network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import of numpy is standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. No sensitive data or secrets are stored or transmitted. The logic appears to be a standard geospatial utility library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geospatial computation library that performs mathematical calculations without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware or suspicious data handling. It is safe for use in applications requiring Earth surface calculations.",
