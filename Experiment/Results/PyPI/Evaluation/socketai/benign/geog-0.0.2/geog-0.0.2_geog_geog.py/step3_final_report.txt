{
  "purpose": "Provides geospatial calculations such as distance, bearing, and propagation on Earth's surface using spherical models.",
  "sources": "Reads input points (longitude, latitude) in arrays or scalars; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; purely computational functions.",
  "flows": "Input points are converted to arrays, then used in mathematical formulas to compute distance, bearing, or new positions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard spherical Earth formulas (haversine, initial bearing, destination point) using numpy for vectorized operations. It handles both scalar and array inputs correctly, with no signs of malicious logic or external data leaks. The functions are straightforward, relying on well-known mathematical formulas, and do not perform any network or file operations. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in benign intent is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented geospatial utility library with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
