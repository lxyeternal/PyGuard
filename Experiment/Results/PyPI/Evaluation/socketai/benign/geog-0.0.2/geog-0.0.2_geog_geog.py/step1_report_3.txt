{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate distances, bearings, and propagate points on the Earth's surface using spherical geometry, primarily for geospatial analysis.",
  "sources": "Input points (p0, p1) and parameters such as angles and distances, supplied as arrays or individual values.",
  "sinks": "Calculated outputs include distances, bearings, and new coordinate points; no external or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input points are converted to arrays, then used in trigonometric calculations to produce distances, bearings, or new locations. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward geospatial calculations with no suspicious or hidden code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard numpy operations to perform geospatial calculations based on spherical earth assumptions. It includes functions for distance, course, and propagation, with input validation and optional degree/radian conversions. No external data fetching, network communication, or file operations are present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The implementation is typical of geospatial utility functions, and the code structure and logic are transparent and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign geospatial utility library with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard calculations without external dependencies beyond numpy, and there are no suspicious patterns or hidden functionalities.",
