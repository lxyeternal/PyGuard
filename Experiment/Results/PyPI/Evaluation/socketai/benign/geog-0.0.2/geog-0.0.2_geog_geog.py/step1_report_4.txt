{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic computations such as calculating distances, bearings, and propagating points on Earth's surface using spherical models.",
  "sources": "Input points (p0, p1), angles, distances; potentially from external or user input.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; functions perform calculations without data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Inputs (points, angles, distances) flow through mathematical transformations within functions; no external or untrusted data handling beyond parameter input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geographic formulas for distance, bearing, and position propagation on a sphere. The functions include appropriate input handling and mathematical operations. There are no indications of malicious data handling, external network communication, or backdoors. Usage of numpy ensures numerical stability, and the code follows typical patterns for such computations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward implementation of geographic calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a well-structured, standard utility module for geospatial computations.",
