  "purpose": "Import geographic functions from a local module for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and relative import from .geog module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; purely static import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static import of functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import syntax, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'absolute_import' feature for compatibility and three functions ('distance', 'course', 'propagate') from a local 'geog' module. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal and standard for a Python module, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
