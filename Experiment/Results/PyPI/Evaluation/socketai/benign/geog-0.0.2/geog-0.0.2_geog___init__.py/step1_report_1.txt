{
  "purpose": "This code imports geographic calculation functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.geog'. No input or data reading from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; no source-to-sink paths are observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard import statements with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions ('distance', 'course', 'propagate') from a local module 'geog'. The use of '__future__' import indicates compatibility considerations but is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal Python import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a typical import of functions from a local module. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
