  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions related to geographical calculations such as distance, course, and propagation from a module named geog.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the module .geog",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this short code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement. It uses a future import for absolute_import to ensure compatibility across Python versions. No input reading, data processing, or output is performed. The imported functions relate to geospatial calculations, which are common in many legitimate applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import statement for geospatial functions. It does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
