  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing geographic functions such as distance, course, and propagate from a module named geog.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and relative import from .geog module",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; only imports are used",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just module import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code uses a __future__ import to ensure compatibility and performs a relative import from a local module named geog. There are no function calls, data processing, or external communication. The import statements are standard and do not exhibit any malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for geographic functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
