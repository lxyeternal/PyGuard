  "purpose": "This code imports geographic calculation functions from a local module named 'geog'.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and relative import from .geog",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this snippet only contains import statements without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import is standard and benign; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a __future__ import to ensure compatibility across Python versions, and a relative import of functions from a local module 'geog'. There is no evidence of any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be part of a larger module that provides geographic utilities. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an import statement for geographic functions within a package. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
