{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'geog' Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static package configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily reads a local file and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Input source (README.md) is read and assigned to a variable; no data flows from untrusted external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; straightforward use of setuptools for package setup with no embedded or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic or external inputs influencing the package configuration beyond the static file read. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
