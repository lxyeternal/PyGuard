  "purpose": "This is a setup script for packaging a Python project called 'geog'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes data, executes untrusted input, or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (besides standard author info), or unusual behaviors are observed. The code uses standard setup and packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for encoding and package setup, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup with project metadata. There are no dynamic executions, no network calls, and no suspicious code patterns. It is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe.",
