  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'geog', providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; package and dependency definitions in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications beyond standard package setup",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) to long_description (sink), then passing dependencies to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard use of setuptools; no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads the README file for documentation, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and extras. No code executes untrusted data, no network connections, and no code obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It correctly prepares the package for distribution without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
