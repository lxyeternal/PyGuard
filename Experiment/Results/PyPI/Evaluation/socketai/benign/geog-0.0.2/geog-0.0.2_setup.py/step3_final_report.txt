  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file.",
  "sources": "Reads local 'README.md' file for long description; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads static file and passes static metadata to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and extras. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows common packaging practices. No obfuscation, embedded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score near 0, with a negligible 0.1 in one report which is acceptable given the static file read. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All assessments and scores are accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
