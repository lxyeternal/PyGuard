{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Django-based image processing utility that normalizes rotation, converts image modes, resizes, crops, and saves images with specified formats and qualities.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from ContentFile objects, particularly from uploaded files or in-memory streams.",
  "sinks": "Saves processed images back to storage via the save method, writing to in-memory BytesIO streams before final storage.",
  "flows": "Image data is loaded from ContentFile, optionally normalized for rotation, converted for format compatibility, resized/cropped, and then saved as a new file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image normalization, format conversion, and resizing using well-known libraries (PIL, Django). It handles EXIF orientation, converts image modes based on target formats, and processes images in-memory, avoiding external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured image processing utility for Django projects, with no indicators of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0. All reports accurately reflect the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
