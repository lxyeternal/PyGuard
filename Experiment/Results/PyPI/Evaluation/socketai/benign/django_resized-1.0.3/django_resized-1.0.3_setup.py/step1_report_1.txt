  "purpose": "The script sets up the packaging configuration for the 'django-resized' Python project, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is directed to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file to incorporate its content into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.rst').read() without explicit error handling; no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools, specifying metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It imports and calls setup() with standard parameters. The only data read is the README file, which is typical for package descriptions. There are no input streams, untrusted data handling, or code execution mechanisms present. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It purely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
