  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for dependency management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 across all reports would more accurately reflect the minimal inherent risk, assuming external method safety."
