  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, scoring, and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard asyncio-based subprocess execution utility, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It handles output, platform differences, and pseudo-terminals appropriately.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code does not exhibit any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The security risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern. The confidence level is high, consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper subprocess management, argument escaping, and platform handling. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The security risk is very low, and the confidence is high, matching the detailed analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the subprocess execution, output handling, and safe argument escaping. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns. The security risk is low, and confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the robustness of subprocess management, output capturing, and platform-specific handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code appears legitimate, and the low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the secure design, proper escaping, and absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no hidden or obfuscated code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Confidence levels are high, matching the thorough reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed reviews and consistent reasoning, **the code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of an asyncio-based subprocess utility**. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard subprocess handling)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-implemented, secure subprocess management utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
