  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard subprocess execution framework with no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It emphasizes the platform-specific handling, safe argument escaping, and the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent with the code. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The platform-specific handling and argument escaping are standard. The security risk score is modest, reflecting the potential misuse if user inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe subprocess management, argument escaping, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis aligns with the code. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, given the code's nature. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a standard async subprocess utility with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It highlights safe handling of output and argument escaping.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent with the code. The low security risk score is justified, as the code is a typical subprocess utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a robust, standard implementation for subprocess management with no signs of malicious activity. It supports output capturing, pseudo-terminals, and safe argument escaping.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis is accurate. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the absence of malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a safe, standard subprocess management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It handles platform differences properly.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent with the code. The security risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code, there are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is a typical subprocess wrapper with asyncio, argument escaping, and platform handling.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risks of subprocess execution if inputs are malicious. Since the code itself is safe, these scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9-0.95), consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Slight risk if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is secure.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured asyncio-based subprocess utility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are appropriate and justified.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Final malware score: 0.0**  \n**Final obfuscated score: 0.0**  \n**Final security risk score: 0.1**",
