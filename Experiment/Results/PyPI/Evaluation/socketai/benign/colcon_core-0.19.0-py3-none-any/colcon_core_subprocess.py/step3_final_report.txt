  "purpose": "A utility to run subprocess commands asynchronously, capturing stdout and stderr via callbacks, with platform-specific handling and argument escaping.",
  "sources": "Input command arguments, environment variables, and callback functions invoked during process execution.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions processing output; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input args -> subprocess creation -> output streams -> callbacks; no suspicious data flow or malicious patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. Argument escaping is standard; platform handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard asyncio-based subprocess wrapper with output capturing, platform-specific adjustments, and argument escaping. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess management, callback invocation, and platform handling follow best practices. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if callbacks are malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure asyncio subprocess utility with no malicious or suspicious features. It is well-structured, with appropriate platform handling and argument escaping. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
