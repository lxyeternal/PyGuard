{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving file system paths relative to a base directory, typically used in scripts or applications to handle file paths consistently.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory via os.getcwd() and input values passed to resolve_path().",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data; it only computes and returns path strings. No sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input value is checked for default; if not default, it is combined with the base directory to produce an absolute path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard library functions and third-party library appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward utility routines for path resolution. resolve_path() computes absolute paths based on provided input and current directory. get_cwd_path_resolver() creates a partial function binding the current working directory at the time of call. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code relies on standard Python libraries and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focused solely on path resolution, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
