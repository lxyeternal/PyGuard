  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for resolving filesystem paths relative to a specified or current working directory, avoiding resolution when default argument values are detected.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters 'value' and the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write, transmit, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked against default status; if not default, it is combined with 'base' (or current directory) to produce an absolute path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path resolution with a benign external dependency check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'resolve_path' for converting a path to an absolute path relative to a base, and 'get_cwd_path_resolver' which creates a partial function fixing the base as the current directory. It uses standard libraries and an external utility 'is_default_value'. The logic is simple, safe, and intended for utility purposes. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The external dependency 'is_default_value' is assumed trustworthy. The code performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The use of 'functools.partial' and 'os.path' functions is standard and safe. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for path resolution with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
