  "purpose": "Utility functions for resolving file system paths relative to a base directory, mainly used for handling command-line arguments or configuration paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'value' parameter passed to 'resolve_path' and the current working directory via 'os.getcwd()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no significant sinks where untrusted data causes security issues, as the code only performs path resolution and string manipulation without executing or writing data.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is processed by 'resolve_path' to produce an absolute path; 'get_cwd_path_resolver' creates a partially applied function that uses the current directory at the time of its creation to resolve paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to resolve paths based on the current working directory or a given base. It employs safe path operations via 'os.path.abspath' and 'os.path.join'. The 'is_default_value' check prevents unnecessary resolution when default argument values are used. The use of 'functools.partial' is standard and does not introduce obfuscation or malicious behavior. No untrusted input execution, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended for path resolution in a safe manner. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
