  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension management utility with no embedded malware or malicious intent. The main security consideration is the potential risk from external extensions loaded dynamically, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on external extension content. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use in trusted environments."
