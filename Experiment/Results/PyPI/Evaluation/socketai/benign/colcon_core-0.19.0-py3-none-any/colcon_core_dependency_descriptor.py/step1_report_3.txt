  "purpose": "Define a dependency descriptor class for representing package dependencies with optional metadata.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __new__ and __init__ methods (name, metadata).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or output operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from __new__ and __init__ to setting attributes; no external data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The class design is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from str, allowing dependency names to be treated as string objects with additional metadata. The __new__ method constructs the string object, and __init__ adds metadata. The deep copy method optimizes copying the metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured data class for managing dependency information, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
