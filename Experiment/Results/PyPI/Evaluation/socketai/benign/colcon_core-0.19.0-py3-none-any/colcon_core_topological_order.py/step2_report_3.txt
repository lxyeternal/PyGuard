  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the potential security implications, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of topological sorting for package dependencies.\n- It relies on external functions (`get_decorators`, `add_recursive_dependencies`) which are assumed to be standard or safe.\n- No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose aligns with dependency resolution in package management.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 0.95**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies no malicious activity. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious behavior. The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected; the analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious activity; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, justified given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a standard, dependency-resolving topological sort with no signs of malicious intent.\n- External functions are assumed safe; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe from a security perspective. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
