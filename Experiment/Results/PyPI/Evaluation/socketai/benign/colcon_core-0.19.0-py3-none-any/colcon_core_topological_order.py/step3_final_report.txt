  "purpose": "Order packages topologically based on their dependencies for build or deployment sequencing.",
  "sources": "Package descriptors, decorators, and recursive dependencies obtained via external functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "From package descriptors and decorators through dependency resolution to topological ordering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard topological sort algorithm for package dependencies, utilizing external functions to retrieve decorators and add recursive dependencies. It maintains a dependency graph, identifies packages with no remaining dependencies, and orders them deterministically. No external data handling, network activity, or code obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common dependency resolution patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of dependency sorting with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risks and functions as intended for dependency management.",
