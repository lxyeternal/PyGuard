  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Dependency topological order for package build/deploy.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: All standard, internal data processing, no external untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard dependency resolution, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95.  \n  *The risk score seems high given the benign analysis. Since the code performs dependency sorting without external data or malicious activity, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 would be more appropriate.*\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and analysis.\n- No anomalies, external data, or malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.  \n  *Again, the risk score of 1 is excessive. The code is standard dependency sorting, so a lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) would be justified.*\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.  \n  *Same reasoning applies; the risk score should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.*\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.  \n  *Same as above, lower risk score is appropriate.*\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.  \n  *Again, the risk score should be adjusted downward.*\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward implementation of topological sorting for package dependencies, relying on external functions (`get_decorators`, `add_recursive_dependencies`) which are standard and likely safe.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Currently very high (mostly 0.95 to 1). Given the benign analysis, these should be lowered significantly.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be adjusted to a low value, e.g., **0.1 or 0.2**, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a standard dependency management utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The high risk scores assigned are unjustified and should be lowered accordingly.",
