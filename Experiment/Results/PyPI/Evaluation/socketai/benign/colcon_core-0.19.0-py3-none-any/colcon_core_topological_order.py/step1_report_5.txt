{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for topologically ordering package descriptors and decorators based on dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package descriptors and decorators, which are inputs passed to the functions; it also accesses attributes such as decorator.recursive_dependencies and decorator.descriptor.name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, external outputs, or sensitive information leaks. No data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input package descriptors -> get_decorators() -> add_recursive_dependencies() -> topological_order_decorators() -> dependency resolution -> output ordered list.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs standard dependency resolution logic without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for ordering package descriptors based on dependencies. It uses imported functions (add_recursive_dependencies, get_decorators) that are external, but their usage appears standard. Dependency resolution is performed with typical set operations and sorting. Error handling raises exceptions if circular dependencies are detected. No external network, file I/O, or other suspicious activities are present. The code's purpose aligns with dependency management, and there are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for topologically sorting packages based on dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is part of a dependency management system without any suspicious or malicious code elements.",
