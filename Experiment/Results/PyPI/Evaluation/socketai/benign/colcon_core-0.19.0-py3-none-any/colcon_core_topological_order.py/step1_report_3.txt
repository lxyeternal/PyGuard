{
  "purpose": "The code orders packages topologically based on their dependencies to ensure correct processing order.",
  "sources": "The code reads package descriptors, decorators, and dependency data through function parameters and imported functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted input for critical actions like network, file system, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (descriptors and decorators) are processed to build dependency maps, which are then ordered topologically without external untrusted data injection points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code performs standard dependency graph processing and sorting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to perform topological sorting of package dependencies using standard algorithms. It relies on imported functions for dependency extraction and decoration. The logic appears to be straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for dependency ordering with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs dependency resolution using safe data structures and sorting methods. The code is well-structured and free from anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
