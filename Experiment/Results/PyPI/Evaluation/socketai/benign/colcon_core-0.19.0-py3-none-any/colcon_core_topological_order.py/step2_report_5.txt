  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, standard dependency sorting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or insecure data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, standard topological sort implementation for package dependencies, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 (high confidence in safety).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard dependency resolution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 (full confidence in safety).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, standard dependency ordering with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: dependency sorting without anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports, standard dependency management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is a dependency sorter, which is inherently safe.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or dynamic code execution.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** All reports assign a risk score of 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the analysis. The highest risk score assigned is 0.95, which is still just below 1, indicating high confidence in safety.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports. Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and the analysis, a risk score of **0.0** is appropriate. The original reports' scores of 0.95 and 1 seem overly cautious for this code, which is standard dependency management logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0                 | No signs of malicious behavior.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0                 | Clear, standard code without obfuscation.                    |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0                 | No vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.         |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of package dependency sorting, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores should be adjusted to zero to reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that external functions (`get_decorators`, `add_recursive_dependencies`) are from trusted sources. If they are compromised, the overall security posture could be affected, but based solely on this code, it appears safe.",
