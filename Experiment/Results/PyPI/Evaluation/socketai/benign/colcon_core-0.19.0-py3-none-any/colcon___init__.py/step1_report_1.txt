  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, the specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and function parameters; no external data sources are explicitly accessed in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs via return statements and possibly logging functions; no apparent external network connections or file writes are shown.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and parameters flow through functions to produce outputs; no suspicious or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are visible; code appears straightforward with standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables, processes input parameters, and performs typical operations such as calculations or string manipulations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behavior are detected. The lack of external network activity or hidden functions reduces suspicion. The structure is clear, and there are no signs of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard utility code without any hidden malicious intent or security flaws.",
