  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python package module, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network, or outputs, and interacts with environment variables or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters through functions and possibly to sinks like network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors observed. No unusual or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or malicious system modifications evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python features. It does not contain obfuscation, hidden imports, or dynamic execution. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries seems benign. There are no indications of code injection, insecure handling of secrets, or other security risks. The absence of network activity or system tampering points to no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign module with no suspicious activities. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
