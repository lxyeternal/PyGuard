  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, file I/O, network calls, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, imported modules, external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, system commands, environment variables, data outputs, logging, potential external servers.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, files, network) to sinks (network, files, system commands) via code execution, data processing, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, incomplete code, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no suspicious activity, appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores, and high confidence. Report 5 exhibits obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and network activity, justifying higher suspicion scores. The scores are consistent with the described code features, with minor adjustments suggested for report 5 to reflect moderate suspicion more accurately.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low security risk, while report 5 shows significant suspicious features, warranting moderate concern. The scoring aligns with the evidence, with potential for slight score increases in malware suspicion for report 5. Overall, the assessments are justified and consistent with the code analysis.",
