It is well-structured, with appropriate platform handling and argument escaping. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence in this assessment is high."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for dependency management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 across all reports would more accurately reflect the minimal inherent risk, assuming external method safety."

The main security consideration is the potential risk from external extensions loaded dynamically, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on external extension content. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use in trusted environments."
