{
  "purpose": "A generic class decorator to wrap and extend the behavior of another class instance.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from the 'decoree' parameter during initialization and through attribute access/assignment.",
  "sinks": "Attribute get/set operations on 'self' and 'decoree'. No external data or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Attributes are delegated between the decorator and the decoree, with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard attribute delegation with assertions to prevent misuse.",
  "analysis": "The class decorates an object, allowing additional attributes and delegated attribute access. It asserts '_decoree' is not in kwargs to prevent conflicts. The '__getattr__' method forwards attribute lookups to the decoree, while '__setattr__' updates attributes either locally or on the decoree. No data leaks, network calls, or malicious code are detected. The assertions and attribute delegation are standard Python practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a class decorator with attribute delegation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as intended for extending class behavior without side effects.",
