{
  "purpose": "A generic class decorator that proxies attribute access and modification to an underlying object, ensuring encapsulation and attribute forwarding.",
  "sources": "The __init__ method reads the 'decoree' parameter and kwargs; __getattr__ accesses the '_decoree' attribute; __setattr__ modifies attributes on self or the decoree.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; the code does not perform network operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Attribute access and setting flow from the decorator to the decoree object via __getattr__ and __setattr__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions to prevent overwriting '_decoree' could be bypassed if assertions are disabled, but this is a minor correctness concern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard proxy/decorator pattern with attribute forwarding. It does not contain network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Assertions are used for internal consistency but are not security measures. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a class decorator pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe behavior, and the scores should reflect minimal security concern.",
