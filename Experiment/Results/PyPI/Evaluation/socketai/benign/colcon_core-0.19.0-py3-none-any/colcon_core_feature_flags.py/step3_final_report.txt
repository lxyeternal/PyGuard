  "purpose": "Manage feature flags via environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS', parse flags separated by OS-specific separator, and log warnings about enabled or implemented flags.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' using os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "Logs warnings about feature flags; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Retrieves environment variable, splits into flags, checks for specific flags, logs warnings if applicable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward environment variable handling",
  "analysis": "The code manages feature flags by reading an environment variable, parsing flags separated by the OS separator, and issuing warnings when flags are enabled or have been implemented. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or any malicious actions. The logic is simple and standard for feature toggling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The environment variable can be manipulated, but this is a common practice and not inherently insecure. The warning logs serve informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign feature flag management utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal risk associated with environment variable handling. No modifications to the scores or assessment are necessary.",
