  "purpose": "Manage and check feature flags via environment variables for a Python package, primarily for enabling or warning about pre-production features.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' accessed through os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "The code reads the environment variable and logs warnings; no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' -> get_feature_flags() -> is_feature_flag_set() -> logger.warning()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of environment variables and logging is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script manages feature flags through an environment variable, parsing it using the system's path separator. It warns when certain flags are enabled, indicating potential instability. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. All functions are straightforward and intended for feature management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration utility for feature flags, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs environment variable parsing and logging without side effects or data leaks.",
