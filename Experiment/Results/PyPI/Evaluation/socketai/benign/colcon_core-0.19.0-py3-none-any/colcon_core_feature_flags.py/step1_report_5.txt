{
  "purpose": "This code manages environment-based feature flags for a software system, allowing toggling of pre-production features and logging their usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' to determine which feature flags are enabled.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions that output warnings about feature flags being used or implemented.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' is read by get_feature_flags(), which supplies data to is_feature_flag_set() to check if specific flags are enabled, triggering log warnings if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. Usage of environment variables and logging is standard. No hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines mechanisms to retrieve, check, and warn about feature flags set via an environment variable. It uses standard Python practices, environment variable access, and logging. No input validation vulnerabilities or malicious flows are identified. The code appears intended for feature management and user notification, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard feature flag management utility that reads from environment variables and logs usage. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use and poses no threat based on the provided content.",
