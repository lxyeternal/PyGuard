  "purpose": "Manage and check environment-based feature flags for controlling pre-production features in a robotics software framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables using os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks detected; no output or untrusted data handling beyond environment variable reading",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' is read, parsed into flags, checked against implemented flags, and logged for warnings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of environment variables is standard for feature flags, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads an environment variable to determine enabled feature flags, logs warnings for implemented or enabled flags, and manages internal state to prevent repeated warnings. It does not perform any network activity, file modifications, or system commands. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. All actions are consistent with feature flag management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of environment-based feature flag management without malicious intent or security issues. It safely reads environment variables, logs relevant warnings, and tracks state internally. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
