{
  "purpose": "The code manages feature flags via environment variables for controlling pre-production features in a robotics framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' using os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks, no unsafe data handling or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' -> get_feature_flags() -> is_feature_flag_set() -> logging warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables for feature control, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves feature flags from an environment variable and checks if specific flags are set, issuing warnings if certain conditions are met. It does not perform any system modifications, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The use of environment variables for feature flags is common and not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The only notable behavior is warning logs for feature flags, which is benign.\n\nThe flow is straightforward: reading environment variables, checking set flags, and logging warnings. There are no external data transmissions, code injections, or harmful behaviors.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a benign feature management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard feature flag management module with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It responsibly handles feature toggles via environment variables and logs relevant warnings. No security risks or malware are present.",
