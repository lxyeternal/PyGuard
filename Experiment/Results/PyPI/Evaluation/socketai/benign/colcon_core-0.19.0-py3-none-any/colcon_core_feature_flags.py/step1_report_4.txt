  "purpose": "Manage and check environment-based feature flags for enabling pre-production features in a robotics software environment.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COLCON_FEATURE_FLAGS' using os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is written to external systems or used in unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Environment variable value flows from os.environ.get to internal list for feature flag checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard use of environment variables and logging; no obfuscated code or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves feature flags from an environment variable, checks if specific flags are set, and logs warnings if certain flags are used or deprecated. It does not perform any unsafe operations such as executing untrusted input, connecting to external domains, or handling sensitive data maliciously. The functions follow typical patterns for environment variable parsing and logging with no signs of malicious intent or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard environment variable management module for feature flags with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. It is safe based on its current logic and context.",
