  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal Python CLI entry point script that delegates execution to an external command handler. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk score, are appropriate and justified."
