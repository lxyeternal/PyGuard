  "purpose": "Entry point script for invoking colcon in multi-Python environments, delegating execution to colcon_core.command.main()",
  "sources": "Importing sys and colcon_core.command modules",
  "sinks": "Calling sys.exit() with the result of colcon_core.command.main()",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call main() -> exit with main()'s return value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and colcon_core.command, then calls sys.exit() with colcon_core.command.main(). It functions as a minimal launcher, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. The security of the overall system depends on the external main() function, but this snippet itself is benign. No anomalies, obfuscation, or risky behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal Python CLI entry point script that delegates execution to an external command handler. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk score, are appropriate and justified.",
