{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, as indicated by the functions and logic present.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or imported modules, and possibly reads files or network responses depending on context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, subprocess calls, or data output functions that could leak information or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscated code features or malicious payloads detected. Usage of dynamic execution appears standard if present, but requires further context.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, importing standard libraries and defining functions without evidence of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious imports, no obfuscated strings, or unusual control flows. The absence of hardcoded secrets or backdoors suggests low malicious intent. Careful review of network or subprocess calls should be performed if present, but none are evident here. Overall, the code looks benign based on the visible parts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It performs expected functions with standard security practices. No immediate security risks or malicious behaviors are identified.",
