  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded strings, network or file I/O (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, system modifications, or code execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "From sources like input/env vars to sinks such as eval/exec, network calls, or file operations, indicating potential malicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscated strings.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that most reports lack actual code, leading to low risk and malware scores, with high confidence in benign assessments. Report 5 presents suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The obfuscation score of 0.7 and malware score of 0.4 are justified given these patterns. The other reports correctly assign zero or low scores due to absence of code or benign code. The overall reasoning aligns with best practices, balancing suspicion with evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning appropriate low scores. Report 5's suspicious patterns justify a moderate malware score (~0.5), high obfuscation (~0.7), and elevated security risk (~0.6). The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the analysis appropriately highlights obfuscation and dynamic code as primary concerns.",
