  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward auto-generated API stub with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.5 seems slightly high; a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score?** No malicious or risky behavior; purely static imports.\n- **Malware score?** Correct at 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is accurate.\n- **Consistency?** Scores are consistent with the report.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Similar to above, a risk score of 0 is more fitting.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code or data handling; purely static imports.\n- **Malware?** Correct at 0.\n- **Assumptions?** None.\n- **Scores?** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Again, a risk score of 0 is more accurate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity, code is static, machine-generated comment is standard.\n- **Malware?** Correct at 0.\n- **Scores?** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. A risk score of 0 is more suitable.\n- **Justification:** Static import statements, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Malware?** Correct.\n- **Scores?** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. A risk score of 0 fits better.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, purely static imports.\n- **Malware?** Correct.\n- **Scores?** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and auto-generated.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are uniformly set at 0.5, but given the benign nature, a score of 0 would be more accurate for all.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated API import module for TensorFlow's estimator export functionalities. It poses no security threat, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** Adjust the risk scores from 0.5 to 0 for all reports to better reflect the benign nature of the code.",
