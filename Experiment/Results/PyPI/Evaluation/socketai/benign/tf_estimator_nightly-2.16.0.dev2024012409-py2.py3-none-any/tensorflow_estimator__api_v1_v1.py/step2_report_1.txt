  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected in the code. The code is straightforward module import and wrapping.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, security risk is 0. The conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk justification:** No reason to increase the risk score; the code is standard auto-generated API setup.\n- **Obfuscated/malware:** None observed.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment; no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious or suspicious behavior. The module wrapper is a common pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or flaws.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1. The small security risk might be due to module modification, but it's standard practice.\n- **Risk justification:** The security risk is minimal and typical for such patterns.\n- **Obfuscated/malware:** None.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the code is standard for module wrapping.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1. The risk score seems slightly elevated for such a pattern but is acceptable given the module wrapping.\n- **Risk justification:** The wrapping could be misused if altered maliciously, but as-is, it's a standard pattern.\n- **Obfuscated/malware:** None.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate evaluation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the code is typical auto-generated module wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.95, malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Risk justification:** Correct; no risks identified.\n- **Obfuscated/malware:** None.\n- **Overall:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard module wrapping.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2. Slightly higher security risk score, but justified due to module modification.\n- **Risk justification:** Given the pattern, the risk is minimal and typical.\n- **Obfuscated/malware:** None.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the dynamic module wrapping, which is a common pattern in large frameworks for API management.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (small risk due to module wrapping, but standard and justified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, auto-generated API management code with no security concerns.",
