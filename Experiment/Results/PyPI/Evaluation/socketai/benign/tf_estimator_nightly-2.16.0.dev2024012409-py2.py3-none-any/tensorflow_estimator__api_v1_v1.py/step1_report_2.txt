{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a module wrapper for the TensorFlow API, specifically for the tf_estimator._api.v1 namespace, primarily for API exposure and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system modules dictionary (_sys.modules) and the imported tensorflow_estimator._api.v1.estimator module.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies _sys.modules[__name__], which could influence module import behavior, and interacts with the module_wrapper to potentially alter module behavior.",
  "flows": "The code checks the current module type in _sys.modules, then possibly replaces it with a wrapped version of itself, affecting subsequent imports of this module.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicating the file is machine-generated is common in auto-generated code. The module modification logic could be misused if malicious, but it appears to be standard for API management. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with a comment indicating machine-generation, which is typical for large, auto-created API files. It imports system modules and specific TensorFlow components. The core logic checks if the current module is wrapped; if not, it wraps it using TFModuleWrapper, likely for API management or deprecation notices. The behavior is consistent with standard API wrapper patterns, with no signs of malicious activity. The code's intent seems to be to control module access and deprecation warnings, a common pattern in large libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard auto-generated API wrapper code for TensorFlow, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It modifies module import behavior for API management purposes. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
