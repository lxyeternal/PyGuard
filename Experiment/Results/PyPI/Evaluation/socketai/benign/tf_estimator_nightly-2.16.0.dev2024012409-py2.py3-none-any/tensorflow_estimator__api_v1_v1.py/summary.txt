  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The module wrapping pattern is typical in large frameworks like TensorFlow. The security risk is minimal and justified. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code."
