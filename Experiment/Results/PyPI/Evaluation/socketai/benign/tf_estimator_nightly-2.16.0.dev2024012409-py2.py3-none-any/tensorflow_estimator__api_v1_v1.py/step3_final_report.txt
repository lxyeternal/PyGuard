  "purpose": "Auto-generated module setup for TensorFlow API exposure, involving import and conditional wrapping of the module with a custom wrapper.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, tensorflow_estimator._api.v1.estimator, and tensorflow.python.util.module_wrapper; accesses sys.modules and the current module.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules[__name__] with a wrapped module object.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Checks module type -> Replaces sys.modules entry with wrapped module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of module wrapping pattern, which could be misused if altered, but is standard in large frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated API module that imports necessary components and conditionally wraps itself with a custom module wrapper. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The pattern is common for managing API exposure, deprecation, or versioning. The module wrapping is benign in this context, and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected. The code's behavior aligns with standard practices, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The module wrapping pattern is typical in large frameworks like TensorFlow. The security risk is minimal and justified. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
