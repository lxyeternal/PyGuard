  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, dynamic constructs, environment variables, network calls, and external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., user input, environment variables) flow into processing functions, with potential malicious actions occurring at network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual patterns include complex constructs, obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, showing no concrete malicious activity. Slight complexity or obfuscation is acknowledged but not deemed malicious. Confidence levels are high where code is available; low where code is absent. Overall, the assessments are cautious and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. Scores are appropriately low, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
