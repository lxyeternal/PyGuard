{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the standard input (e.g., via input() or sys.stdin), environment variables, or imported modules that may retrieve external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket or requests modules), file writing operations, or subprocess executions that could be exploited to leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via intermediate processing or eval/exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code patterns observed. However, unusual patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports should be verified. Without specific code, cannot identify particular anomalies.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be completed due to the absence of actual code snippets. Generally, the analysis involves identifying where untrusted data originates, how it propagates through the program, and whether it reaches sensitive sinks that could cause security issues. Checking for obfuscation, suspicious imports, or dynamic code execution is crucial. Since no concrete code is provided, the review remains high-level and cautious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible malicious patterns and the lack of specific code, there is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears benign but should be reviewed with the actual implementation to confirm security safety.",
