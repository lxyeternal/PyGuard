  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes that the code defines the public API for TensorFlow Estimator, mainly through imports.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** All are internal, static imports; no data from untrusted sources or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Machine-generated, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard library code exposing classes/functions; no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or lower). The report's confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static imports, no external data, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Also safe, standard API setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, static import statements, no dynamic code, no external input.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: static imports, no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard API module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others: purely import statements, no external data or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is auto-generated, static, and solely performs imports.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any runtime logic that could be exploited.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, since no obfuscation or suspicious code is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (just static imports for an SDK API), a risk score of **0** is appropriate. The only exception might be if the package were compromised, but based on the code alone, no such risk exists.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated API setup for TensorFlow Estimator, with no security concerns.",
