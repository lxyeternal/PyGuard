{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal or placeholder script with no functional logic or data flows.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input reads, or external data interactions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are identifiable due to absence of code execution paths.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable; code is empty or non-functional.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious imports, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is either empty or a placeholder, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. This absence of code eliminates any possibility of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score due to the lack of content. Confidence is limited by the absence of code but is appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the overall security posture is minimal threat. The assessment aligns with the provided code snippet and the analysis of its structure.",
  "confidence": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
