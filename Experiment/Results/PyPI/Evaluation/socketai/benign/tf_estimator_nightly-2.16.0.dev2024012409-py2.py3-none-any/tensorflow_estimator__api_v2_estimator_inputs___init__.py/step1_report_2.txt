  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or interaction with external systems, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, imported modules, or network requests (if present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, system calls, or network communication points where untrusted data could be sent or influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from sources (user input, env vars) to sinks (output, network), but specific paths are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal and lacks substantial logic, making detailed source-to-sink flow analysis impossible. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident. Absence of suspicious imports, backdoors, or hidden behaviors suggests the code's intent appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems straightforward and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. Confidence is high that this code is not malicious.",
