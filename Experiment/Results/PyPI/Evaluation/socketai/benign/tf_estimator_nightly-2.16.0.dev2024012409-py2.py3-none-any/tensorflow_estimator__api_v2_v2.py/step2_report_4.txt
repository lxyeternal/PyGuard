  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated, consisting solely of import statements and comments.\n- No data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No untrusted data sources, secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is to define or expose an API namespace, which is typical in SDK or library setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original code snippet: it contains only comments, import statements, and module docstrings.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code logic or structure.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and auto-generated.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The reports' assessments and conclusions are justified and reasonable.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores Justification:\n- Since the code is purely static, auto-generated, and involves only safe import statements, the risk and malware scores should remain at zero.\n- No reason exists to increase these scores based on the evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n- The overall security assessment should remain that this code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, auto-generated API setup module with no security concerns.",
