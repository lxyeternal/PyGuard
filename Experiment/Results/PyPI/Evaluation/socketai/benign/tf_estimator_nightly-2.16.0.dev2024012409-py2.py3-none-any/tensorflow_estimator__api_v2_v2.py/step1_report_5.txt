{
  "purpose": "Provides public API access for the tf_estimator._api.v2 namespace in TensorFlow.",
  "sources": "Import statement: imports 'estimator' from tensorflow_estimator._api.v2.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of machine-generated comment, but no obfuscated code, secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single import statement. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or data sinks. The import appears standard for a package module. The comment indicates auto-generation, which is common in SDKs and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module that imports a component from a package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
