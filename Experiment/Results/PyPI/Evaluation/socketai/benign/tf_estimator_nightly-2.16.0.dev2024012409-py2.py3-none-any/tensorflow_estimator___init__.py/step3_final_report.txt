  "purpose": "Manage API exposure and deprecation for tensorflow's v1 estimator namespace through module wrapping.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module, accessing __name__, and the module's own sys.modules entry.",
  "sinks": "Modification of sys.modules to replace the current module with a wrapped version.",
  "flows": "Code reads sys.modules[__name__], then assigns a wrapped module back into sys.modules[__name__].",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module replacement via sys.modules, which could influence module behavior but is a known pattern in large frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated for API management, wrapping the module with TFModuleWrapper to handle deprecation and API exposure. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code is present. The pattern is standard in frameworks like TensorFlow. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The manipulation of sys.modules is a controlled pattern for API management, not malicious. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects this pattern but is justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API wrapper used in TensorFlow for module management. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern of wrapping modules dynamically is standard practice and does not indicate security issues.",
