  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is auto-generated, primarily consisting of import statements from the tensorflow_estimator package.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks is identified across all reports.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The reports assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely import statements, serving as an API stub.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n- The comments explicitly state the code is machine-generated, which is typical for such API files.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 or very low, which is justified given the code's static nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is auto-generated and only contains imports, there is little room for malicious activity.\n- No suspicious patterns or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated API module for TensorFlow's estimator components. It is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
