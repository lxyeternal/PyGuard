{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an auto-generated API module exposing components of the tensorflow_estimator library for TensorFlow estimators.",
  "sources": "Import statements from tensorflow_estimator.python.estimator modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external network operations present",
  "flows": "Static import statements with no data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; comments indicate auto-generation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements for well-known TensorFlow estimator components, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The comments clarify it is machine-generated. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, risk 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for deployment and use within the TensorFlow ecosystem.",
