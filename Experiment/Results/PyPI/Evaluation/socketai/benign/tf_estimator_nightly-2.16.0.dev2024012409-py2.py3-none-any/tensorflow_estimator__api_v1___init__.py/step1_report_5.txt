{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming requests, possibly for serving a web application or API.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP request parameters, environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Output to HTTP responses, possibly writing files or database interactions, depending on request handling.",
  "flows": "Request inputs are processed and potentially used in response generation or stored in a database, with data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no signs of obfuscated or malicious code patterns. Some dynamic import statements or use of eval() are absent, reducing suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server, imports standard libraries, and defines request handling functions. It does not contain any suspicious external network calls, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. Usage of environment variables appears standard. The flow seems to process incoming data and respond accordingly without evident malicious intent. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage is detected. The code structure aligns with typical web application patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard web server setup without malicious intent.",
