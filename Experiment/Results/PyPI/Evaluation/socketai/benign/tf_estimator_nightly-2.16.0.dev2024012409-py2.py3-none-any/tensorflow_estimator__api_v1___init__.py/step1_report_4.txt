{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some basic data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading environment variables, files, or user input (e.g., open(), os.environ, input()), though none are explicitly visible.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include execution of dynamically generated code, network connections, or data storage, but no explicit sinks like eval(), exec(), or network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly defines functions or performs simple operations without untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code structures, or obfuscated segments are detected. The code structure seems straightforward, with no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to be standard Python without obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no signs of data leakage, suspicious external calls, or malicious backdoors. Since the code is incomplete or abstract, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit suspicious or harmful patterns.",
