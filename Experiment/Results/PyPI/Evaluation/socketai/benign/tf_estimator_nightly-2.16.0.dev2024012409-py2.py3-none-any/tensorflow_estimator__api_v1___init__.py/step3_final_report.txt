{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, configuration files, network calls, environment variables, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, database queries, and system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file systems, potentially via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, unusual network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns in data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with no insecure practices detected. The confidence level is high (0.9), and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero, indicating a benign assessment. The low risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern given the lack of suspicious activity but acknowledges the limited scope of analysis. Overall, the code is safe, with no security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The supply chain risk is low, and the dependency appears safe for use. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
