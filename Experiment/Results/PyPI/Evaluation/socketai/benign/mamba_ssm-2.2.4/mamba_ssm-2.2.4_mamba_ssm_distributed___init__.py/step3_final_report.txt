  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include untrusted data, environment variables, network connections, eval/exec calls, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network exfiltration, code execution points, file modifications, or credential theft mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources flow into eval/exec, network functions, or data storage; malicious code manipulates or exfiltrates data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated functions, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code's benign reports (1, 2, 3, 5) show no malicious patterns, with scores reflecting low risk and no obfuscation. The detailed suspicion in report 4 indicates high malicious intent, justified by high malware (0.8-0.85), obfuscation (0.75), and risk (0.9) scores. The reasoning aligns with the described behaviors, and the scores are consistent with the analysis. Overall, benign reports are correctly scored as low risk, while the malicious one appropriately reflects high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with low malware and obfuscation scores; report 4 indicates significant malicious activity justifying high scores. The scores are consistent with the detailed observations, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
