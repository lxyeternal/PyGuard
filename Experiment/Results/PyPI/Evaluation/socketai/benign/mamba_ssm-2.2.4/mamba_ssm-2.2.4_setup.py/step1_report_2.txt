{
  "purpose": "Setup script for building, packaging, and distributing the 'mamba_ssm' Python package, including optional CUDA/HIP extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for description, environment variables for build options, fetching package version from __init__.py, constructing URLs for prebuilt wheels, and subprocess calls to get CUDA/HIP versions.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlretrieve for downloading prebuilt wheel files, subprocess.check_output for querying CUDA and HIP versions, and shutil.move for moving downloaded wheel files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build behavior; URLs are constructed from package and system info; urllib.request downloads wheel; shutil.move relocates wheel files; subprocess outputs determine CUDA/HIP compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of subprocess for version info is standard; URL download is for prebuilt wheels; warnings alert user about missing CUDA/HIP, no suppression of errors. The code uses standard libraries and known build tools without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks for CUDA and HIP, constructs URLs for prebuilt wheels based on system info, and downloads wheel files if available. No suspicious or malicious code is evident; subprocess calls and URL fetches are standard for build automation. The code handles environment warnings responsibly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging and distributing the Python package with optional CUDA/HIP extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its operations are standard for build and deployment processes, with no suspicious signals.",
