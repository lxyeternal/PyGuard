  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential risks, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the script manages build configurations, version checks, and wheel downloads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The download of wheels via `urllib.request.urlretrieve` is standard for prebuilt wheel retrieval.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. The subprocess calls are for version detection, not execution of untrusted code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior. The low malware (0) and security risk (0.2) are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the package setup, environment checks, and wheel download.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard use of URL retrieval and subprocess for version info.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns; standard build script behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes potential supply chain risk due to wheel download from GitHub.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The download process could be exploited if the URL or wheel content were malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** The pattern of downloading prebuilt wheels from remote URLs is common but introduces potential risks if the source is compromised.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Recognizes the supply chain risk but considers the code benign in intent. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, highlights the download of external wheels and subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The download process is standard but could be exploited if the remote source is malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; the pattern is typical for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly notes the low risk assuming remote source trustworthiness.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general pattern—downloads prebuilt wheels, uses environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same potential supply chain concern.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious code or backdoors; standard build process.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected in the code.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** The main concern is the download of prebuilt wheels from remote URLs, which could be compromised, but this is a common practice in open-source distribution.\n- **Behavior & Intent:** All reports correctly interpret the script as a legitimate build/setup process with standard practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external wheel downloads, a cautious but low score of around **0.2** is justified, which aligns with current assessments.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nThis reflects a standard, legitimate build script with a minimal supply chain risk due to external wheel downloads, which is common in open-source packaging but warrants vigilance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary concern is supply chain risk associated with external wheel downloads, but this is a typical pattern and not inherently malicious. Therefore, the current scores are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
