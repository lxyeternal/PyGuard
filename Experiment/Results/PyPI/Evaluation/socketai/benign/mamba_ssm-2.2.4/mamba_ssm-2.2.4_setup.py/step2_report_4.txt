  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: code presence, logic, reasoning, and potential malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup/build script for 'mamba_ssm'. It performs environment checks, version validation, downloads prebuilt wheels from a GitHub URL, and manages compilation flags for CUDA/HIP.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess calls are for version detection, not malicious execution. The wheel download is from a known, legitimate source (GitHub releases). The logic aligns with common build practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to external wheel download), Confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of environment checks, URL-based wheel retrieval, and build configuration.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code detected. Use of subprocess and URL download is typical. The warnings about missing tools are responsible. The download from GitHub is standard for prebuilt wheels.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.0. These are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential supply chain risk of downloading wheels from a remote URL, based on environment info. It notes that the download could be exploited if the URL is compromised but recognizes this as a common pattern.\n\n- **Assessment:** The main concern is the external wheel download. However, this is a standard practice in open-source package distribution. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. The subprocess calls are for version detection.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (due to potential supply chain concern), Confidence = 0.85. These are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing the download of wheels and environment checks. Recognizes the potential supply chain risk but finds no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or malicious code. The download URL is from a known repository. The subprocess calls are for version info.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9. These are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the same pattern: download of prebuilt wheels, environment checks, subprocess calls for version info. Notes the potential supply chain risk but considers it low.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or backdoors. The download source is standard, and subprocess calls are for version detection.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8. These are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a typical build/setup script, not containing any malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the analysis. The only concern is the external wheel download, which is common but could be exploited if the source is compromised.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to reliance on external wheel files, but this is standard in open-source projects.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, standard build script.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — Slight concern about supply chain, but no active malicious activity.\n\n- **Justification:** The script performs environment checks, version validation, and downloads prebuilt wheels from a known, legitimate source. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The external wheel download introduces a supply chain risk, but this is a common and accepted practice, especially if the source is trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The script is a legitimate build and distribution setup for an open-source package, with standard practices and no signs of malicious intent.",
