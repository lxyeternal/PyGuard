{
  "purpose": "This script manages the build and distribution process for the 'mamba_ssm' Python package, including environment checks, version validation, and retrieval of prebuilt wheel files from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for build options, subprocess calls for version detection, URL retrieval for prebuilt wheels, file reading for version info.",
  "sinks": "Downloading wheel files via urllib.request.urlretrieve, subprocess execution for version info.",
  "flows": "Source variables and subprocess outputs lead to URL construction; URL is used to download wheel files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard build script behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation, version checks, and attempts to download prebuilt wheels from a GitHub URL. No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The subprocess calls are solely for version detection. The external wheel download introduces a supply chain risk but is a common practice in open-source distribution. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical build scripts, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and distribution setup for an open-source package. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary concern is supply chain risk due to external wheel downloads, which is a known and accepted practice when sources are trusted. The scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.",
