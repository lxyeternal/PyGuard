  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a setup script for a Python package (`mamba_ssm`).\n- It performs environment checks for CUDA and HIP, version validation, and sets compilation flags.\n- It constructs URLs for prebuilt wheel files hosted on GitHub.\n- It attempts to download prebuilt wheels via `urllib.request.urlretrieve`.\n- If download fails, it proceeds with building from source.\n- It reads version info from package files.\n- No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or direct malicious payloads are present.\n- External subprocess calls are only for version detection.\n- The download of wheels from GitHub is standard in open-source package distribution but can be a supply chain risk if the remote source is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; standard build script.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious code, just environment checks and wheel download.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (low).  \n**Justification:** No malicious activity, just downloading prebuilt wheels from a trusted source.  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; similar to Report 1, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.  \n**Justification:** Same reasoning; downloading from GitHub, no malicious code.\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Similar; notes potential supply chain risk due to wheel download, but this is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a typical build script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.  \n**Justification:** The download could be exploited if the URL is compromised, but that is a known risk in open-source distribution.\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious code, just environment checks and wheel download.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build script, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Same as above; supply chain risk exists but is common.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; similar pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just remote wheel download.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is a standard build script with remote wheel retrieval, which is common but introduces supply chain risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2), reflecting the supply chain risk of downloading prebuilt wheels from external URLs. This is a known and accepted risk in open-source distribution, especially when using trusted sources like GitHub releases.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned by all reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the analysis is accurate.\n- The primary concern is supply chain security, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — due to reliance on external wheel downloads, which could be compromised if the source is malicious, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a typical setup script with external wheel retrieval, which introduces some supply chain risk but no malware or obfuscation. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
