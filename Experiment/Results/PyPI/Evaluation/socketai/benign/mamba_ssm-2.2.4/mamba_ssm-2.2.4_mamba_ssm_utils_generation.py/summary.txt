  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended for efficient inference in transformer models. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no external data leaks. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the performance optimizations that could be misused if exploited, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present."
