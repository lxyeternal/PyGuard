  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs conditional imports of `custom_fwd` and `custom_bwd` functions from either `torch.amp` or `torch.cuda.amp`, based on the presence of an attribute.\n- It defines a decorator `custom_amp_decorator` that wraps these functions, adding or modifying the `device_type` argument if `cuda_amp_deprecated` is True.\n- The purpose appears to be compatibility handling for different PyTorch versions or configurations, ensuring that AMP functions behave correctly.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, file writing, or data exfiltration.\n- The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for maintaining compatibility.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, as expected, given the code's benign purpose.\n- **Purpose and analysis:** All reports correctly identify the code as a compatibility utility, with no malicious intent.\n- **Flow and sinks:** The data flow is limited to function imports and wrapping; no external data or network activity.\n\n**Any discrepancies or concerns?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The logic and implementation do not suggest any hidden malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's benign and compatibility-focused nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I would agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.5 (or even 0), but given the reports' scores, 0.5 is acceptable if considering potential future misuse, which is unlikely here.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as the code is benign and intended for compatibility)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured compatibility wrapper for PyTorch AMP functions, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the code's safety profile.",
