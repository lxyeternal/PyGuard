{
  "purpose": "The code aims to create decorators for torch's automatic mixed precision functions (custom_fwd and custom_bwd), with conditional handling based on deprecated attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'torch.amp' attribute and imports 'custom_fwd' and 'custom_bwd' from either 'torch.amp' or 'torch.cuda.amp'. It also reads the 'deprecated' flag to determine the source.",
  "sinks": "The code applies a decorator that modifies the arguments passed to 'custom_fwd' and 'custom_bwd'. No data sinks or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Input data from attribute detection and imports flows into decorated functions, which modify the 'kwargs' before calling the original functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs conditional import and decorator wrapping but contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of 'torch.amp.custom_fwd' to determine the import source, which is a standard practice for compatibility. It defines a decorator that modifies 'device_type' in the keyword arguments based on a flag. The decorator is applied to 'custom_fwd' and 'custom_bwd'. There are no external data leaks, suspicious data flows, or malicious modifications. Overall, the code is a straightforward implementation for handling deprecated attributes with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility and decorator wrapper for PyTorch's automatic mixed precision functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
