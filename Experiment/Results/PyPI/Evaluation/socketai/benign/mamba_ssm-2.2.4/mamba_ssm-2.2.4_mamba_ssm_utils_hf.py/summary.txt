  "conclusion": "The code is standard for loading models from Hugging Face, with minor logical flaws that are typical programming mistakes rather than security issues. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minor code quality issues but no security threat."
