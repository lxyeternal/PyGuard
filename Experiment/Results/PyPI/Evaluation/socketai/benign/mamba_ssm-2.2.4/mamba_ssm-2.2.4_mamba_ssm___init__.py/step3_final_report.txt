  "purpose": "Set version string and import modules/functions from the mamba_ssm package for machine learning or data processing.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__; import statements from mamba_ssm modules",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment are static; no runtime data flow or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and module imports. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The imported modules relate to machine learning or data processing, but their usage is not shown here. The code is syntactically correct, transparent, and typical for module setup. No external data sources, sinks, or dynamic code execution are involved. The security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be considered even lower given the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
