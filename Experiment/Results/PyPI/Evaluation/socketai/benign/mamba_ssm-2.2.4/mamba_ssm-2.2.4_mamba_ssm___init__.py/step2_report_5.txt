  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- Sets a version string (`__version__ = \"2.2.4\"`).\n- Imports multiple modules and functions from the `mamba_ssm` package, including interface functions, model classes, and modules related to machine learning or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and all imported modules and functions are standard import statements. No anomalies like obfuscation or suspicious syntax are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Data flow:** The snippet only shows static imports and a version declaration; no runtime data flow, input/output, or external effects are present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No signs of vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Issues and scores:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely import statements and a version declaration, with no malicious code or behavior evident.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and readable; no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign a very low security risk score (~0.1 or 0).\n- **Justification:** The code is minimal and safe; no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- Given the nature of the code, the assigned scores seem appropriate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The only point to emphasize is that, since this is a small snippet, the actual security implications depend on how these imported modules are used elsewhere. However, based solely on this fragment, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or very close to zero)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be standard, safe module setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No further action or concern is warranted based on this fragment.",
