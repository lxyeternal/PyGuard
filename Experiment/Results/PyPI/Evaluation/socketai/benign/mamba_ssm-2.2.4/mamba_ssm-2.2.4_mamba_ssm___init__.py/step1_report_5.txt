{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set version information and import various modules related to 'mamba_ssm', likely for a larger application involving selective scanning and models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'mamba_ssm.ops', 'mamba_ssm.modules', and 'mamba_ssm.models' indicate the code reads module files and class/function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and functions; there are no data flow paths, input handling, or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports specific functions and classes from the 'mamba_ssm' package. No execution or data handling occurs here. The imports suggest reliance on external modules which are not shown, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code structure and content are typical for a module initialization segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of version declaration and module imports. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
