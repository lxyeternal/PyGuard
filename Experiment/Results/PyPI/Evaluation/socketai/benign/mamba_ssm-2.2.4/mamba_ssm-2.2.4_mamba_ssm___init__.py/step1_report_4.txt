  "purpose": "The code imports modules and functions related to a system or application, likely for processing or modeling tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the mamba_ssm package, including selective_scan_fn, mamba_inner_fn, Mamba, Mamba2, and MambaLMHeadModel.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly shown in this snippet; it only shows import statements without any runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward import statements with no obfuscated or unusual syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports several functions and classes from the mamba_ssm package. No runtime behavior, input handling, or output generation is present. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be part of a larger application setup or initialization process.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only benign import statements and a version declaration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe based on this fragment.",
