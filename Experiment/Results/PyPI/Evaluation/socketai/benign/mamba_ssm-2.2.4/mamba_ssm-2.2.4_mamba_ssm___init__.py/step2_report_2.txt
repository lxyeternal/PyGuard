  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe code that only sets a version string and imports modules/functions from the 'mamba_ssm' package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The code appears to be standard initialization or setup code for a larger application, likely involving machine learning models.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual Report Review**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is just setting a version and importing modules, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Comment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the code's benign nature. Since no suspicious activity is detected, a score of 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correct at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Overall:** No issues; the scores overstate risk slightly.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with identical reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Comment:** Same as above; the minimal risk score is acceptable but could be lowered to 0.0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: straightforward imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Fully consistent. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly overstated at 0.1 in reports 1 and 2; given the code snippet, a score of 0.0 is more justified.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Justification & Overall Assessment**\n\n- The code snippet is purely for setting a version and importing modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are correct.\n- The security risk score should be lowered to 0.0, as there are no security concerns evident in this fragment.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores for the Entire Code:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0            | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0            | Clear, straightforward import statements.                   |\n| Security Risk     | 0.0            | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or suspicious patterns.       |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The existing scores should be slightly adjusted to reflect this, particularly lowering the security risk to 0.0.",
