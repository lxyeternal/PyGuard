  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- Sets a version string: `__version__ = \"2.2.4\"`\n- Imports multiple modules and functions from the `mamba_ssm` package, including interface functions, model classes, and modules related to machine learning or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is limited to setting a version string and importing modules. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.  \n  **No issues are present in the code snippet itself.**\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  The overall risk score is low (around 0.1), which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious behavior in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They recognize that this is a benign setup code fragment without any execution logic, data flow, or external communication.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified, as there is no malicious code.\n- The **security risk score** of 0.1 is reasonable, considering that in a larger context, imported modules could potentially be misused, but nothing in this snippet indicates such misuse.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential for Reconsideration:\n- Given the minimal code, there is no reason to adjust scores upward.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly slightly lower, e.g., 0.05, but 0.1 remains reasonable)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code itself is benign.  \n- The imported modules may be part of a larger system that could have security implications, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n**The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.**  \n**No changes are necessary.**  \n**Overall, this code appears safe and standard for a module initialization segment.**",
