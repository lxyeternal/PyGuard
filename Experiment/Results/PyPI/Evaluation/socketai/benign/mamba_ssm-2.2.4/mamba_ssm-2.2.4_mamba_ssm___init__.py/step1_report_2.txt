{
  "purpose": "Define version and import specific functions and classes from a module related to 'mamba_ssm' for some processing or model operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'mamba_ssm.ops', 'mamba_ssm.modules', and 'mamba_ssm.models' modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported functions and classes could be used in untrusted ways if misused elsewhere, but the code itself does not demonstrate data sinks.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow, so no source-to-sink data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed. Only straightforward imports and version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string and imports specific functions and classes from a package called 'mamba_ssm'. There is no execution of dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other malicious behaviors. The imported modules suggest a machine learning or processing pipeline, but nothing suspicious is evident in the snippet provided.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import and version declaration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger system likely related to machine learning or data processing, but on its own, it shows no signs of malware or security risks.",
