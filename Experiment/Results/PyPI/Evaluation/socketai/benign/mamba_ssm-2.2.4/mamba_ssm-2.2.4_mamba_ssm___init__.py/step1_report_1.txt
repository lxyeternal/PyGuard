{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version and import modules related to 'mamba_ssm', likely part of a larger application or system involving machine learning models or data processing components.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'mamba_ssm.ops.selective_scan_interface', 'mamba_ssm.modules.mamba_simple', 'mamba_ssm.modules.mamba2', and 'mamba_ssm.models.mixer_seq_simple'. No direct input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules but does not execute any data flow or process logic within this snippet. Potential flow could involve these imported modules performing further data processing or network communication elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident in this minimal snippet. The code is straightforward and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "This code only sets a version string and imports several modules from a package named 'mamba_ssm'. The imported modules suggest functionality related to machine learning models and interface components. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks within this fragment. Without further context or additional code, there is no indication of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears standard and safe, primarily initializing dependencies for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply imports modules and sets a version, indicating standard setup procedures without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
