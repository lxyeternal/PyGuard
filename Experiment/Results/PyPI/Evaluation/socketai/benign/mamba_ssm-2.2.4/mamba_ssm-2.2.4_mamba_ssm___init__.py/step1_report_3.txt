{
  "purpose": "To import specific functions and classes from the mamba_ssm package, likely for performing machine learning or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from the mamba_ssm package, which may involve reading data or configuration during execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writing, or system commands in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be fully determined from import statements alone; no source-to-sink flow is evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an assignment to __version__ and multiple import statements from the mamba_ssm package. These imports suggest use of machine learning modules, but there is no indication of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are evident. The code appears standard and intended for normal application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of modules and functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be part of a larger application setup without malicious intent.",
