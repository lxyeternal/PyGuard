{
  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, suspicious data flows, and insecure practices.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, network endpoints, file reads, dynamic code execution points (e.g., eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data externally), file writing, environment variable access, system commands, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks such as network endpoints or file outputs, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), encrypted or encoded code segments, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network endpoints, or incomplete/missing code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but no concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The high confidence in benign nature is justified for static analysis. Obfuscation and dynamic code techniques warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation concerns. The malware score is minimal, reflecting no definitive malicious behavior detected. The scores are consistent with the observed signals and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with some obfuscation techniques that warrant monitoring. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is low, but vigilance is advised for dynamic behaviors or further runtime analysis.",
