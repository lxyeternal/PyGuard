  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task within a larger application. (Details are unavailable due to the absence of code provided.)",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (exact sources cannot be identified without the actual code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, command executions, or data leaks to external systems (specific sinks cannot be pinpointed without the code).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via functions or variable assignments; however, detailed source-to-sink paths cannot be established without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or malicious indicators such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls detected from the available information.",
  "analysis": "Without the actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Based on guidelines, no signs of malicious behavior are evident. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. However, the absence of code prevents a definitive conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of provided code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security risks identified. Further review of the actual code content is necessary to confirm safety.",
