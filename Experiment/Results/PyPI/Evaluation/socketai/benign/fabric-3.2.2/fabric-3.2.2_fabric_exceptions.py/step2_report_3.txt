  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- Comments mention potential future refactoring, but this does not impact security.\n- No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or external interactions are evident.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n- The code appears benign, with a focus on exception class definitions and documentation.\n- The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is also 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are also 0, reflecting no security concern.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty based on the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **all zero**.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
