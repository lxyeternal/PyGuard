  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling and organization within a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only declares exception classes without any data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, which are standard and straightforward. No external data is read, no sensitive information is handled, and there are no embedded malicious patterns or obfuscation. The comments indicate intentions for future refactoring or feature addition but do not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only standard exception class declarations with no malicious or security risk indicators.",
