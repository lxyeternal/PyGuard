  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, including future refactoring considerations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and comments; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a TODO comment indicating potential future refactoring; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings and comments. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The comments suggest future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent. No obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. The current scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
