  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; purely class definitions and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings and comments. No data input, network activity, or data handling occurs. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. The comments mention moving code or making it more focused, but this does not impact security. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is safe and contains only standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is purely structural and documentation comments do not suggest any malicious intent.",
