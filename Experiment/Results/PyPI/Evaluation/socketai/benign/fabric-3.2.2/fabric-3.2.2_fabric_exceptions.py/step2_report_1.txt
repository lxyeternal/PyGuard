  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- Comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n- The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: simple class definitions with no logic or external interactions.\n- No issues with the code logic or potential vulnerabilities are present.\n- The comments and structure do not suggest any malicious behavior or hidden code.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- None identified. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign and purely structural.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign higher malware or risk scores since there's no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The mention of future refactoring in comments does not impact security assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and well-commented.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks detected.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, purely definitional, and shows no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the current scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
