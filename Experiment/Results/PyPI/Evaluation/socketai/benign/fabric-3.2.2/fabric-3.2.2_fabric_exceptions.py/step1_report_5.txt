  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines classes and comments only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no data inputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comment indicating potential future refactoring, but no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity exists. The comments suggest some planned refactoring or code organization considerations but do not imply malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple class definitions for exception handling with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger project, but as is, it shows no signs of malicious activity.",
