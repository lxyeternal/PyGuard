  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to task execution, group results, and environment variables in a Fabric-related context.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple custom exception classes with no logic or data processing. It does not perform any input/output operations, network calls, or data handling. The classes serve as error indicators within a larger application context, likely related to task management or environment validation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
