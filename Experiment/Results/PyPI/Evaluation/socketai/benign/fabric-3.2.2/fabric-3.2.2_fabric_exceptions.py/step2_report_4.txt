  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the underlying code, then assess the scores and reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk is also 0, as there are no security flaws or dangerous behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in Code:**\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no logic or data processing.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The code is safe and standard.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The comments are benign and relate to potential refactoring, not malicious intent.\n- No mistakes are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores Given and Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- No reason to assign a higher risk score than 0.\n- The code is purely structural, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply describe the code.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Security researcher estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious.",
