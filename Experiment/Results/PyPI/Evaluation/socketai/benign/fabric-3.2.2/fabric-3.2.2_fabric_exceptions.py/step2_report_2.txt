  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- Comments mention potential future refactoring, but these are benign and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n- No evidence of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The comments do not suggest any malicious activity; they are standard developer notes.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified, as no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
