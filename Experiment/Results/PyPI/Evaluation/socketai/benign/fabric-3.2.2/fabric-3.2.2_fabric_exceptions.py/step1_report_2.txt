  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task execution, group results, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code consists only of class definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception classes with no logic for data input, processing, or external interactions. It includes only class definitions and docstrings. No code injections, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are present. The comment suggests a potential future refactoring but currently is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard exception class definitions for use within a larger application. No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
