{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing various internal components and handling optional dependencies for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, including a try-except block for optional module import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Standard import pattern with a conditional import for version compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a try-except block for an optional dependency. There are no data processing, network activity, or code execution elements. The optional import is a common pattern for handling dependencies based on environment capabilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as standard module setup. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be 0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
