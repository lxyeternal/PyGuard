  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** The code is purely import statements with no data processing or network activity.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The logic is straightforward and well-documented.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — all reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk detected.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above; purely import statements with a conditional import for version compatibility.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package setup.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Again, just imports, including a conditional import for optional dependencies.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same pattern—module imports with a try-except for optional dependencies.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical module initialization code.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Identical structure—imports with a conditional import.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is just importing modules. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. **Malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and well-documented. No obfuscation is evident. **Obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no data leaks, no network activity, and the code is purely structural, the overall security risk is negligible. **Risk score should be 0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard package initialization, managing imports and optional dependencies.\n- No data flows, network operations, or execution of untrusted code.\n- The conditional import is a common pattern for compatibility, not malicious obfuscation.\n- The absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns justifies zero scores across malware, obfuscated code, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
