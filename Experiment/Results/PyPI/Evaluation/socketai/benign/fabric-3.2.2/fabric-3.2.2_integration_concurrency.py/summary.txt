  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing suite for SSH connection independence, threading, and data verification. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its controlled testing environment."
