      "conclusion": "The code contains security risks due to hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations but shows no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The malware score should remain 0. The obfuscated score is appropriate at 0. The risk score, reflecting the embedded secrets and environment modifications, should be around 0.4. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants caution regarding secret management."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common in setup scripts but should be used with trusted files. Overall, the script is safe, and the risk is minimal."

No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its controlled testing environment."
