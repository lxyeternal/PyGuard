  "purpose": "Demonstrates fabric's remote command execution and exception handling on localhost and specified hosts.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded hostnames/IPs used in fabric's ThreadingGroup instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed; commands are benign; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Commands executed on specified hosts; exceptions caught and asserted; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward command execution and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign remote command executions using fabric, with proper exception handling for expected errors. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of hardcoded hostnames/IPs is typical for testing but could be a minor concern outside controlled environments. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security risk, and no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test/demo script for fabric's command execution capabilities. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-critical issues are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with its testing purpose.",
