  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fabric' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), filesystem (os.path.isdir), reading _version.py, reading README.rst, and package installation parameters.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, file system checks, reading files, executing _version.py code, and passing package data to setuptools.setup().",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package name/binary selection -> filesystem checks determine package variant -> reading version file -> passing all metadata to setuptools for package build.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of exec() to read version info from _version.py is standard practice, assuming controlled source. No network activity or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py used for Python packaging. It conditionally sets package names and binaries based on environment variables and filesystem state, which is common for handling package variants. It reads version info from a local file without importing modules, reducing risk of executing malicious code during setup. All dependencies and metadata are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified. The use of exec() is controlled and based on a local file. No network communication, data leakage, or malicious code execution pathways are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles package configuration securely, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
