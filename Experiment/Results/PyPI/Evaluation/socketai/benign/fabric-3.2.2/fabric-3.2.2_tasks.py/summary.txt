  "conclusion": "The code contains security risks due to hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations but shows no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The malware score should remain 0. The obfuscated score is appropriate at 0. The risk score, reflecting the embedded secrets and environment modifications, should be around 0.4. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants caution regarding secret management."
