{
  "purpose": "Defines invoke tasks for testing, coverage, documentation, release, and environment setup, including a fabric version shim.",
  "sources": "sys.path modifications, hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin'), environment variables, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Use of c.run() commands, fabric environment configuration with secrets, pip install commands, import statements.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded secrets flow into fabric environment setup; sys.path modifications affect module search paths; secrets are embedded into environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded passwords and hostnames, sys.path removal of current directory, explicit environment variable settings, use of import within functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily automates testing and deployment tasks with embedded secrets, which pose security risks if exposed. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The sys.path manipulations are unusual but not malicious. The hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin') are security concerns but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior suggest internal tooling rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains security risks due to hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations but shows no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The malware score should remain 0. The obfuscated score is appropriate at 0. The risk score, reflecting the embedded secrets and environment modifications, should be around 0.4. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants caution regarding secret management.",
