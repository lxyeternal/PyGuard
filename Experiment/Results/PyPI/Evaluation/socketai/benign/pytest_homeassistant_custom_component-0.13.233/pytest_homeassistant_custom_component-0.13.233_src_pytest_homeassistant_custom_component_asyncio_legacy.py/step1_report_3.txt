{
  "purpose": "This code provides a minimal implementation of legacy asyncio.coroutine support, including a wrapper class for coroutines and a decorator for marking functions as coroutines, primarily for backward compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from asyncio, collections.abc, functools, inspect, logging, traceback, types, warnings; usage of sys._getframe for source traceback; decorator and class initialization code that wraps user-defined functions and generators.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points such as network, file, or system commands. The code does not perform data output or external communication directly.",
  "flows": "User-defined functions are wrapped via legacy_coroutine, which inspects and potentially yields from generator or awaitable objects, then wraps them with CoroWrapper for debugging and source tracking.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated asyncio.coroutine and related legacy constructs, but this is for compatibility rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, unusual variable usage, or obfuscated logic. The only potentially suspicious element is the use of sys._getframe, which can be considered a source of source traceback but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to maintain compatibility with older asyncio coroutine patterns by providing a CoroWrapper class for debugging and a decorator to mark functions as coroutines. It employs standard Python inspection, traceback extraction, and coroutine wrapping techniques. No external network activity, data leaks, or harmful operations are present. The only notable aspect is the use of sys._getframe, which is common in debugging but can be misused in malicious contexts; however, in this context, it is used solely for traceback purposes. Overall, the code appears to be a standard backward compatibility layer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility layer supporting legacy asyncio coroutine patterns, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities. Its use of debug and traceback features is appropriate for development and debugging purposes.",
