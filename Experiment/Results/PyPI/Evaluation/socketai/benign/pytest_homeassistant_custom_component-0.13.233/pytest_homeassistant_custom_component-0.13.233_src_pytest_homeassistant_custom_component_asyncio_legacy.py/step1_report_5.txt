{
  "purpose": "The code provides a legacy coroutine wrapper for asyncio, facilitating compatibility with older coroutine styles and ensuring proper handling and debugging of coroutine objects.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources; it mainly defines classes and functions for coroutine handling.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that write data to external systems, network, or files based on untrusted input; it only handles coroutine wrapping and debugging.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code is primarily structural and utility-based, without input/output or data processing pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code includes deprecated warnings and coroutine handling, which are standard for legacy codebases. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a coroutine wrapper class for debugging and legacy support, including a decorator to mark coroutines and ensure proper exception logging. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with warnings about deprecated features. No external data is read, nor is any malicious behavior evident. The purpose appears to be maintaining compatibility and debugging aid, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for handling legacy coroutines, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It mainly provides debugging and compatibility support. The overall security risk is minimal.",
