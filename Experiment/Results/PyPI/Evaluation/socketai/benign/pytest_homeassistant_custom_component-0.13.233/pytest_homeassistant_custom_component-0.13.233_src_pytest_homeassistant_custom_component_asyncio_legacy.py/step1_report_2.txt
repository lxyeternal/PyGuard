{
  "purpose": "Provides a minimal legacy asyncio.coroutine implementation and wrapper for coroutine objects, mainly for compatibility with older code that uses the deprecated @coroutine decorator.",
  "sources": "The code reads from sys._getframe(1) for source traceback extraction, and inspects functions and generators via inspect module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator 'legacy_coroutine' wraps functions, which may produce coroutine objects or generator objects, which are then wrapped in CoroWrapper. The CoroWrapper interacts with generator methods and properties, but does not perform external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hidden data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. Use of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard. The code primarily involves coroutine management without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CoroWrapper class to manage generator-based coroutines, including traceback extraction and cleanup logging. The 'legacy_coroutine' decorator issues a deprecation warning, then wraps functions to support both generator and awaitable behaviors, utilizing inspect and asyncio internal modules. It adheres to standard coroutine handling patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, system modifications, or network operations. The code's purpose is purely for coroutine compatibility and debugging support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility and debugging utility for asyncio coroutines, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard techniques for coroutine wrapping and traceback logging. The overall security risk is negligible.",
