{
  "purpose": "Provides a minimal, backward-compatible implementation of asyncio coroutines with debugging support, including a wrapper class (CoroWrapper) and a decorator (legacy_coroutine) to support older coroutine styles and facilitate debugging.",
  "sources": "Uses introspection functions such as sys._getframe, inspect.isgenerator, and traceback extraction for debugging and source traceback collection.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Source data from introspection and traceback extraction flows through debugging and warning mechanisms; no external data flow or malicious data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "Utilizes deprecated features like asyncio.coroutine, sys._getframe, and traceback extraction solely for debugging and compatibility; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a compatibility layer for legacy asyncio coroutines, wrapping generator and coroutine objects for debugging purposes. It employs introspection to extract source traceback information and issues deprecation warnings for outdated coroutine syntax. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of deprecated and introspective features is typical for debugging and legacy support, not malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility and debugging utility for legacy asyncio coroutines. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Its use of deprecated features and traceback extraction is solely for debugging support, not malicious purposes. The security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe.",
