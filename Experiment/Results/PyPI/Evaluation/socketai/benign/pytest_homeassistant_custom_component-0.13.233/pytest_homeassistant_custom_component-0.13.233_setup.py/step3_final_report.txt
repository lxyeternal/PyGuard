  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements_test.txt', version from 'version' file, long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "File reads for requirements, version, and description, then passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' is set to '>=3.13', which is a non-existent Python version, indicating a configuration mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. It reads files for dependencies and metadata, then calls setuptools.setup(). No untrusted code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The only issue is the 'python_requires' version specifier, which is likely a typo, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. The minor version requirement typo does not introduce security risks but should be corrected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only notable issue is the incorrect Python version requirement, which is a configuration error, not a security concern. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
