  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package for distribution, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'version' file, dependencies from 'requirements_test.txt', and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or transmitted outside standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reads files for version, dependencies, and description; uses setuptools to configure package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly reads dependencies, version info, and description, then calls setup() with provided metadata. No suspicious file access patterns or data leaks. No dynamic code execution or network activity. The package configuration appears typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads external files for configuration and defines package metadata securely.",
