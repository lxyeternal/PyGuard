{
  "purpose": "A static list of test modules and test cases that are known to throw uncaught exceptions, used for managing or filtering test failures during test runs.",
  "sources": "The list itself, which is a hardcoded static data structure within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is a static configuration without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, well-commented static list with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static list used for test management, containing tuples of module paths and test case names with comments explaining their purpose. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The comments clarify that some tests intentionally throw exceptions. The code's simplicity and purpose indicate a benign configuration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration list for managing known test exceptions. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores reflect this. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
