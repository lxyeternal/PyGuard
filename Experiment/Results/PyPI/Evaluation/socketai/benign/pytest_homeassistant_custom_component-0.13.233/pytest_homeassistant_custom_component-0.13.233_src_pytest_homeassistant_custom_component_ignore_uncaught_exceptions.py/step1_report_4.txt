{
  "purpose": "This code maintains a list of test cases with known uncaught exceptions that should not be considered failures, for use in a testing environment.",
  "sources": "The list is hardcoded within the script itself, with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the list is static and not involved in any processing beyond storage.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a static list of test cases with comments indicating they are intentionally throwing exceptions. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network calls, credential handling, or obfuscated logic, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward static list used for testing purposes, likely to ignore known failing tests during automated runs. It does not perform any dynamic actions, data processing, or external communications. The comments clarify the purpose as related to test management. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration list used for managing test exceptions in a testing suite. No malicious activity or security concerns are evident.",
