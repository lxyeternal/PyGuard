  "purpose": "Maintain a list of tests that are known to throw uncaught exceptions for debugging or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "The list of tuples assigning test modules and test case names to the variable IGNORE_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTIONS.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is a static list declaration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-commented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of test cases that are known to raise uncaught exceptions, likely used to ignore or flag these during test runs. It contains descriptive comments explaining the purpose of each test. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be part of a testing framework or configuration file for test management. It does not include any network calls, file I/O, or external dependencies that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration list used for testing purposes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a filter for test exceptions.",
