{
  "purpose": "The code maintains a list of test cases that intentionally throw uncaught exceptions, to ensure they are not removed from the test suite.",
  "sources": "The list initialization with test case tuples, including test module names and function names.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external data handling points.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely defines a static list.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a static list of test case identifiers; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a list of tuples representing test modules and functions that are expected to throw uncaught exceptions intentionally. No external inputs, network calls, or data processing are present. The list is for test management purposes and does not include any malicious behavior or malicious code patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a configuration or reference list for test cases that intentionally trigger exceptions. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
