  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward constants module defining version numbers using static assignments and string formatting.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code imports only from `typing` for type hints and uses `Final` annotations for immutability.\n   - The version components are hardcoded, and the comments clarify the origin.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static constants definition.\n   - They uniformly conclude no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is consistent: no data flows, no external inputs, no suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, the code does not pose any security threat.\n   - **Confidence (1):** Justified, the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n   \n4. **Potential Concerns or Discrepancies:**\n   - The code is very simple and static; there are no hidden or malicious elements.\n   - The reports are consistent in their benign assessment.\n   - No changes needed in scores or reasoning.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The version numbers are static; if future modifications introduce dynamic behavior or external inputs, reassessment would be necessary.\n   - Currently, no evidence suggests any malicious intent or security concern.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.**",
