  "purpose": "Define constants used by Home Assistant components, including version numbers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' module; assignment of version constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the code only assigns constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only defines constants. The 'PATCH_VERSION' as a string is consistent with typical versioning practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints, defines version-related constants with 'Final' annotations, and constructs version strings. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code is simple, well-structured, and serves as a constants module. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a constants definition module for versioning, and does not contain any malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
