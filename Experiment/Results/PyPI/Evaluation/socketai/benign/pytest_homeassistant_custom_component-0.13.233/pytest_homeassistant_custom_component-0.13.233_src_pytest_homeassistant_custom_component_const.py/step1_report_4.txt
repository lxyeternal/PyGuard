  "purpose": "Define and modify version constants for Home Assistant components, with no direct input or data processing.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned directly in the code: MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION, PATCH_VERSION, __short_version__, __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data; no external calls or data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all assignments are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of straightforward constant definitions and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version constants using static values and string formatting; it includes comments about origin and modification but no dynamic or user-input-driven behavior. No external data or inputs are involved, and no suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of constant definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard versioning setup with no anomalies or malicious code.",
