  "purpose": "Define constants for Home Assistant components, including version information.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments for version numbers (__version__, MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION, PATCH_VERSION).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines constants related to versioning. The version numbers are hardcoded and static. There are no input sources, no dynamic execution, no data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The comments indicate it's a modified version of a core component, but no malicious intent or harmful code is evident. The code structure and content are standard for a version/constants file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/constants module. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and no suspicious anomalies present.",
