  "purpose": "Define version constants for Home Assistant components.",

  "sinks": "No external data input or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; version constants are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static version constants using fixed values and string formatting. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The imports are for type hints and constants, which are benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static constants definition for versioning, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
