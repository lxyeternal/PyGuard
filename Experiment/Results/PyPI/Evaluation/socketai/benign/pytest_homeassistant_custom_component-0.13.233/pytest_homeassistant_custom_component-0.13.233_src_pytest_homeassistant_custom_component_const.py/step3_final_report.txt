  "purpose": "Define static version constants for Home Assistant components.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version number components assigned to constants; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constants without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing' to declare constants for versioning. All version components are statically assigned, with no runtime modifications or external data processing. Comments indicate origin and modification but do not influence execution. The code is purely declarative, serving as a version reference. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The use of 'Final' annotations is standard for constants. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static constants module defining version information with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
