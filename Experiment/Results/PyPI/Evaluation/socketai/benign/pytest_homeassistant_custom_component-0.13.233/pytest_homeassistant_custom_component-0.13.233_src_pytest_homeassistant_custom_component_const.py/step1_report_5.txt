  "purpose": "Define constants for Home Assistant components, including version information.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; constants are hardcoded within the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; version constants are static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code declares several version-related constants using Python's typing.Final for immutability. There are no external data inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The comments indicate the file's origin and modifications, but no suspicious or malicious code elements are present. The code is static and primarily for configuration or versioning purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static declaration of version constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its purpose as a configuration/constants file without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
