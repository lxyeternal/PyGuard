  "purpose": "Define typing helpers, mock classes, and type aliases for testing Home Assistant components.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (aiohttp, unittest.mock), and local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows; primarily type definitions and class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Use of mock classes and type aliases is standard for testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and mock class definitions for testing Home Assistant components. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party packages (aiohttp, unittest.mock). The classes and type aliases are straightforward, aimed at facilitating testing and mocking. No external data inputs, unsafe code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of a testing setup rather than operational logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical testing utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It defines mock classes and type aliases to support testing frameworks. No suspicious behavior or malware signals detected.",
