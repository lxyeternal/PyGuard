  "purpose": "Typing helpers and mock class/type definitions for testing Home Assistant components.",
  "sources": "Imports, class definitions, and type aliases which primarily define data structures and mock interfaces.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to untrusted sinks; primarily static definitions and mock setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; code consists of type annotations, class definitions, and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type hints, mock classes, and interface definitions for testing purposes within Home Assistant. It imports external modules like aiohttp and unittest.mock, and defines mock classes and type aliases. There are no data processing, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard for testing environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of testing helpers and type definitions for Home Assistant components. There is no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies.",
