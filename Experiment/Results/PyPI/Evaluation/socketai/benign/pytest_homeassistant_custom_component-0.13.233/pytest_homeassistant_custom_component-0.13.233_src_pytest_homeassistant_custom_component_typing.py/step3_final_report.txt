  "purpose": "Type hints, mock classes, and interface definitions for testing Home Assistant components, primarily for mocking and type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, contextlib, typing, aiohttp, unittest.mock, and local recorder module; class definitions and type aliases for testing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - code is static definitions and mocks, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward testing helpers with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, mock subclasses, and type aliases used for testing Home Assistant components. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The classes and type aliases are standard for testing environments. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is clear, simple, and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as testing scaffolding with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
