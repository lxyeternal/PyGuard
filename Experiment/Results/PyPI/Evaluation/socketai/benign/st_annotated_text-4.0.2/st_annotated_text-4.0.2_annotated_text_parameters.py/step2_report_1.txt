  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely for defining styling constants, importing a unit function, and setting up color palettes and style parameters.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data processing, or network communication is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The code appears straightforward and benign, serving as configuration for UI styling.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Reports:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defining style constants and importing units.\n- **Sources:** Import from 'htbuilder.units' — standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Sinks:** None; only variable definitions.\n- **Flows:** Import -> assignment -> usage — straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree the code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Confidence levels** are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n- The only minor point is that the code comments mention compatibility with Python 3.7+, which is correct, but this doesn't impact security.\n- Since all reports are in agreement, there's no discrepancy to challenge.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, static configuration script with no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe, with no security issues.",
