  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing a unit function and defining styling constants.\n- No untrusted data, external network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The import from 'htbuilder.units' appears standard and legitimate.\n- The purpose is purely styling/configuration for UI components.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is benign; no issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report logic:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no errors detected.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - `securityRisk`: All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 0.9), reflecting high certainty.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None are made; the analysis is cautious and correct.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign styling configuration script with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
