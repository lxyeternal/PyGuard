  "purpose": "Define color palette and style constants for a visualization or UI component, utilizing units from an external library.",
  "sources": "Import from 'htbuilder.units' module, specifically 'unit'. Usage of 'unit.rem' to define a variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external library 'htbuilder.units' appears legitimate; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'unit' module and assigns 'rem' to a variable for consistent measurement units. It defines a color palette array and an opacity array, along with styling constants for padding, border radius, font size, and label properties. All elements are straightforward configuration variables without any data processing, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. The comments suggest compatibility considerations across Python versions, but no malicious or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration/setup script for UI styling purposes. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a benign, purposeful snippet for styling constants.",
