  "purpose": "Define styling constants and import a unit function for layout measurements in a UI styling context.",
  "sources": "Import from 'htbuilder.units' module and assignment to 'rem'.",
  "sinks": "None; only variable definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "Import -> assign 'rem' -> define style constants and color palette.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module, assigns it to 'rem', and defines various style-related constants such as color palette, opacity levels, padding, border radius, font size, and label spacing. There is no dynamic data, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The code serves purely as configuration for UI styling, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign, static code with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign styling configuration script with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature. The code poses no security threat and requires no further action.",
