{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for rendering annotated text in a Streamlit app, utilizing external utility functions for HTML generation.",
  "sources": "Imports streamlit as st; imports util module; accesses util.annotation; calls util.get_annotated_html",
  "sinks": "st.markdown with unsafe_allow_html=True; potential execution of HTML generated by util.get_annotated_html",
  "flows": "Input args to util.get_annotated_html -> HTML string -> st.markdown rendering",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious external calls; reliance on external util functions but no malicious code evident",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps utility functions to generate HTML for annotated text display in Streamlit. It imports standard libraries and a local util module. The core function calls util.get_annotated_html with variable arguments and renders the output with st.markdown, allowing HTML rendering. There are no evident malicious actions such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The security risk depends on the implementation of util.get_annotated_html, but within this code, no malicious behavior is apparent. The use of unsafe_allow_html=True warrants caution, but the code itself does not perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a wrapper for rendering annotated text in a Streamlit app. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected within this module, assuming util functions are safe.",
