  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward wrapper around utility functions to render annotated text in Streamlit.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of `unsafe_allow_html=True` in `st.markdown`, which can pose security risks if the generated HTML contains untrusted or malicious content.\n- The utility functions (`util.get_annotated_html` and `util.annotation`) are external and not provided; potential security issues could originate there.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external calls within this snippet.\n- Confidence levels are generally high (0.7 to 0.9), indicating that the reviewers believe the code is benign but acknowledge potential risks depending on external functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself does **not** contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It is a simple wrapper.\n- The security risk is primarily due to reliance on external utility functions and the use of `unsafe_allow_html=True`, which can allow injection if the generated HTML is not sanitized properly.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The main flaw is the potential security risk introduced by `unsafe_allow_html=True` without validation or sanitization of the HTML content generated by `util.get_annotated_html`.\n- The code depends heavily on external functions, which are not provided; if those functions do not sanitize input, it could lead to HTML injection vulnerabilities.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Generally around 0.2, reflecting awareness of potential HTML injection risk but no confirmed vulnerability.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nGiven the reliance on external functions and the use of `unsafe_allow_html=True`, a **risk score of around 0.3** could be justified to reflect the potential for security issues if the external functions are insecure.\n\n### Justification for Risk Score > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the potential for HTML injection if `util.get_annotated_html` does not sanitize inputs.\n- Since the code is a wrapper, the actual security depends on external functions, which cannot be assessed here.\n- Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unwarranted unless there is evidence that the external functions are malicious or unsafe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, due to reliance on external sanitization and use of `unsafe_allow_html=True`)\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding the external utility functions and the HTML rendering method.**  \nIf I had to assign a final estimate based on all reports and analysis:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the analysis above.",
