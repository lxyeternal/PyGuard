{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to display annotated text in a Streamlit app, utilizing a utility module for HTML generation and annotations.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'streamlit' library and a local utility module; uses 'util.annotation' and 'util.get_annotated_html' functions, with input arguments to generate HTML.",
  "sinks": "The 'st.markdown' function outputs HTML content, potentially rendering user-provided or dynamic HTML if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (*args) are passed to 'util.get_annotated_html', which generates HTML; this HTML is then rendered in the Streamlit app via 'st.markdown'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present. Use of external utility functions is standard for rendering.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves to facilitate text annotation display within a Streamlit app, relying on utility functions to generate HTML content. It does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it execute any code beyond rendering HTML. The import of a local module could contain malicious code, but based on this fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious code or behaviors are apparent in the visible code; the function simply formats and displays annotated text.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for user interface purposes, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks based on this fragment. The use of utility functions warrants review of 'util' module for completeness, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
