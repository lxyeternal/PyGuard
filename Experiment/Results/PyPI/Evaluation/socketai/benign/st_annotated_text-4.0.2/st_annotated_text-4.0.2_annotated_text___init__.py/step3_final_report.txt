  "purpose": "Render annotated text in a Streamlit app by processing variable arguments into HTML via external utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input arguments (*args) provided to annotated_text, and external functions util.get_annotated_html and util.annotation.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML content from util.get_annotated_html, rendered with st.markdown using unsafe_allow_html=True.",
  "flows": "Arguments (*args) are passed to util.get_annotated_html, which returns HTML; this HTML is then rendered in Streamlit.",
  "anomalies": "Dependence on external utility functions without visible sanitization; use of unsafe_allow_html=True without internal validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper that converts arguments into annotated HTML and displays it in Streamlit. It relies on external functions, which could generate malicious HTML if not properly sanitized. The use of unsafe_allow_html=True introduces potential for HTML injection if the utility functions are insecure. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident within this snippet. The security risk and malware scores are low, reflecting the benign structure but acknowledging external dependencies. The overall risk depends on the implementation of util.get_annotated_html, which is unknown here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper for rendering annotated text, with potential security concerns stemming from external utility functions and HTML rendering method. Scores are appropriately low; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
