  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper that calls external utility functions to generate HTML for annotated text in a Streamlit app.\n- It uses `unsafe_allow_html=True` in `st.markdown`, which can be risky if the generated HTML is untrusted.\n- The core concern is the external `util` module, which is not provided; potential malicious behavior could originate there.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code within this snippet.\n- No network activity, code execution, or data leakage is evident here.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs within this snippet.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security issues:** The main risk is the reliance on external `util` functions and the use of `unsafe_allow_html=True`.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code here.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign around 0.1–0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for HTML injection if `util.get_annotated_html` is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The main vulnerability potential hinges on `util.get_annotated_html`. If that function sanitizes inputs properly, the risk remains low.\n- The reports correctly note that the code itself appears benign but highlight the dependency on external functions.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels (0.7–0.9) are justified given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if there's concern about `util.get_annotated_html` but, based on the current information, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, but considering the use of unsafe HTML rendering, acceptable)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-reasoned.** The primary concern remains the external utility functions' implementation, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential HTML injection if `util.get_annotated_html` is unsafe)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and their reasoning.",
