{
  "purpose": "To provide a function that renders annotated text in a Streamlit application with customizable annotations and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arguments (*args) passed to the annotated_text function, and indirectly calls util.get_annotated_html which likely processes these arguments. It also imports util.annotation and util.get_annotated_html.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the st.markdown function which outputs HTML content generated by util.get_annotated_html. There are no other data sinks that process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into util.get_annotated_html which generates HTML content, then output is rendered in Streamlit via st.markdown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior or obfuscated code. The code relies heavily on the util module, which is not provided; potential concern if util functions perform malicious actions, but cannot be assessed here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around utility functions that generate annotated HTML for display in Streamlit. It accepts various argument types, processes them through util.get_annotated_html, and displays the result. There are no evident security issues or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage within this code snippet. The use of unsafe_allow_html=True in Streamlit is common for rendering custom HTML, but it can be risky if the generated HTML contains untrusted data; however, the actual HTML generation occurs in util.get_annotated_html, which is external to this code and cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility for rendering annotated text in a Streamlit app. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present in this snippet. The main concern depends on the implementation of util.get_annotated_html, which is not provided. Overall, the code structure and usage seem standard and safe.",
