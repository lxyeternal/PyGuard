  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for rendering annotated text in a Streamlit app, allowing users to add customizable annotations to displayed text.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'streamlit' and a local module 'util'. It reads arguments passed to 'annotated_text', which are then processed via 'util.get_annotated_html'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'st.markdown' with HTML content generated by 'util.get_annotated_html'. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments to 'annotated_text' are passed to 'util.get_annotated_html', which generates HTML output that is then rendered in the Streamlit app via 'st.markdown'.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on the 'util' module for HTML generation; without inspecting 'util', potential risks are not directly evident. The use of 'unsafe_allow_html=True' can pose security risks if 'util.get_annotated_html' does not sanitize input properly. No explicit security-sensitive operations or suspicious behaviors are visible in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a function that processes variable arguments, passes them to a helper function in the 'util' module for HTML generation, and then renders the result via Streamlit's markdown function with HTML allowed. The potential security concern is that 'unsafe_allow_html=True' is used, which can lead to HTML injection if 'util.get_annotated_html' does not properly sanitize inputs. However, no malicious code or backdoors are present in this snippet. The reliance on an external utility function means a full security assessment would require inspecting 'util.get_annotated_html'.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a standard utility for rendering annotated text in a Streamlit app. The main security concern hinges on how 'util.get_annotated_html' processes inputs. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are evident from this code alone. Overall, this is a benign utility with a potential risk if the helper function is insecure.",
