  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'st-annotated-text' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static metadata and dependencies within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs processed; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data from README.md flows into setup() parameters; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, static setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script, importing setuptools, reading a local README file, and calling setup() with fixed metadata and dependencies. No dynamic inputs, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.",
