  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a typical `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library. It imports `setuptools`, reads a local `README.md` for the long description, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed.\n- No code obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- The dependencies (`htbuilder`) are publicly available packages, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- The script performs standard package setup tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- Confidence is high (1), and all scores are zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 — Correct, no evident risks.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and thorough, and the code is standard, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n- The absence of any suspicious activity justifies a malware score of 0.\n- The risk score of 0 is appropriate, given the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there is no malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, standard package setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code and reports align perfectly. No modifications are necessary. All indicators point to a safe, standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus of the reports.",
