  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'st-annotated-text' to specify package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources; no data being processed from external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow; the script reads a file locally and calls a setup function with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of standard setup tools and static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools', reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies and parameters are typical for a package setup. No suspicious or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
