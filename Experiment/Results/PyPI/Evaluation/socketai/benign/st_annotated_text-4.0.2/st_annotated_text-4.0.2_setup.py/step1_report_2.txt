  "purpose": "This code configures the setup for a Python package named 'st-annotated-text' using setuptools, including reading a README file for the long description and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward setup configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code appears to be standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The code is typical for Python package distribution and does not include any dynamic code execution, external network communication, or handling of untrusted input. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
