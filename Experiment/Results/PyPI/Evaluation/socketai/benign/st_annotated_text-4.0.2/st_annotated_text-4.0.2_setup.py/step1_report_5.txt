  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'st-annotated-text' with metadata and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output or external system interaction based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading file content and passing static metadata to setuptools.setup(), with no flow from untrusted input to sensitive actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of standard setup tools and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads a markdown file for long description and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-defined parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All inputs are static or from local files, and the process involves only package configuration. The code structure and usage follow conventional patterns for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
