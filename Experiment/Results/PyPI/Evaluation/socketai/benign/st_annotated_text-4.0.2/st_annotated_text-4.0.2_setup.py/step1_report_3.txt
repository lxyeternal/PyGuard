  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README file for the long description and specifies dependencies and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package distribution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
