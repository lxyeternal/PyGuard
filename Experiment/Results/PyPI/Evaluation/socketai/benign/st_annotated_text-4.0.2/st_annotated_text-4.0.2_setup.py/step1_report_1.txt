  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'st-annotated-text'.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data or input sources; configuration parameters are hardcoded or static.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a static README file and specifies dependencies and package info. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or network calls. The code appears typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
