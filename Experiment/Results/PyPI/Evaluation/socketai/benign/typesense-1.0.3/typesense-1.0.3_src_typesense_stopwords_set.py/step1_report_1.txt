  "purpose": "Manage individual stopwords sets in Typesense via API calls for retrieval and deletion.",
  "sources": "Constructor receives stopwords_set_id and api_call; methods use api_call to perform get and delete requests.",
  "sinks": "API calls to endpoints constructed with stopwords_set_id; responses are returned as schemas.",
  "flows": "Constructor sets attributes -> retrieve/delete methods call api_call methods with endpoint -> response returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden code. Proper use of type hints and API encapsulation.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly defines a class for managing stopwords sets with methods to retrieve and delete them via an API. It constructs endpoint URLs dynamically using resource paths and the provided stopwords_set_id. There is no evidence of malicious logic, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The imports are standard, and the methods perform expected API interactions. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code follows typical API wrapper patterns, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate API client module for managing stopwords in Typesense. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. Its design and implementation are straightforward and secure.",
