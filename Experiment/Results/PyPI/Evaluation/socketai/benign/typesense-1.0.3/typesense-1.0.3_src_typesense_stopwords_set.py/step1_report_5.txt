  "purpose": "Manage individual stopwords sets in Typesense via API operations such as retrieve and delete.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the stopwords_set_id parameter and the api_call object used for API requests.",
  "sinks": "The API calls to self.api_call.get and self.api_call.delete are the sinks where untrusted input could potentially cause issues if misused or manipulated.",
  "flows": "stopwords_set_id (source) is used in constructing the endpoint path; this path is then used in API calls (sink) for retrieve and delete operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution or obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious intent. The code is straightforward and primarily interfaces with an external API.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing stopwords sets through API calls, with standard methods for retrieving and deleting data. It constructs API endpoint paths based on a stopwords set ID and uses an API call object to perform network requests. No untrusted data appears to be used in dangerous ways, nor are there any indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage. The use of type hints and clear method structure indicates good coding practices. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks within this isolated module.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides a standard, safe API interface for managing stopwords sets. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical, well-structured API wrapper code with no malicious intent.",
