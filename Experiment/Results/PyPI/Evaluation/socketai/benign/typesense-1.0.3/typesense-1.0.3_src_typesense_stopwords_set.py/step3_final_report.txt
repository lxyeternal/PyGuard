  "purpose": "Manage individual stopwords sets in Typesense via API calls for retrieval and deletion.",
  "sources": "stopwords_set_id parameter used in endpoint URL construction.",
  "sinks": "API call methods (get, delete) sending requests to constructed URLs.",
  "flows": "stopwords_set_id flows into _endpoint_path, which constructs the URL used by retrieve() and delete() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class that manages stopwords sets through dynamically constructed endpoints using a provided ID. It uses standard API call methods with schemas for responses. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The only potential concern is the use of unvalidated input in URL construction, which is typical for such wrappers but could pose minimal risk if input is maliciously crafted. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with best practices for API clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client module with no malicious intent or security issues. The minimal risk associated with unvalidated input is acceptable in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
