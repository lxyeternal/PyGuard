  "purpose": "Manage individual stopwords sets in Typesense via API calls, including retrieval and deletion.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'stopwords_set_id' (from external input), 'api_call' object (provided externally).",
  "sinks": "API call methods 'get' and 'delete' on the 'api_call' object, constructing endpoint URL for API requests.",
  "flows": "The stopwords_set_id is used in '_endpoint_path' to build URL; 'retrieve' and 'delete' methods send requests via 'api_call' with endpoint URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code uses standard API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates straightforward API calls to retrieve or delete stopwords sets, with proper use of type hints and clean structure. The endpoint URL is constructed dynamically based on a resource path and ID. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities or malicious logic detected. The code does not perform any data processing beyond API requests. The imported modules and methods used are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper around API calls for managing stopwords in Typesense. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected, and it does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code. The purpose is straightforward and secure.",
