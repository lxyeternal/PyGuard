  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the reports' conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Code Overview:**\n\n- The code defines a class `StopwordsSet` that manages stopwords sets via API calls.\n- It takes an `api_call` object and a `stopwords_set_id` during initialization.\n- It provides `retrieve()` and `delete()` methods, which call the API with constructed endpoint URLs.\n- The `_endpoint_path` property constructs the URL using `Stopwords.resource_path` and the `stopwords_set_id`.\n- The code appears standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- Imports are typical for an API wrapper.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Manage stopwords sets via API calls.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, code is straightforward, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate, secure, benign.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar assessment: straightforward API wrapper, no malicious intent, proper URL construction, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focus on input parameters and API calls, no anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), possibly due to external input usage, but no evidence of exploitation.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1 (acceptable for minimal external input handling)\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous, standard API interaction, no suspicious code.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: standard API wrapper, no malicious code, safe practices.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1 (again, minimal external input concern)\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious or Malicious Potential:\n\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports.\n- Endpoint URL construction is based on resource path + ID, which is typical.\n- No evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The input parameter `stopwords_set_id` is used in URL construction, which is standard; no unsafe handling observed.\n- The code is a typical API wrapper module.\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to external input handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal external input handling, but no real risk)\n\nThis module is a benign, standard API wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The provided scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
