  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes for handling specific API errors.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Security Risk: 0.0\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard pattern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Security Risk: 0.0\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity, no external data or dynamic behavior.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Security Risk: 0.0\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no suspicious code, purely class definitions.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Security Risk: 0.0\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No external data, no malicious patterns, standard class hierarchy.\n- Malware Score: 0.0\n- Security Risk: 0.0\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence and functionality:** The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, with no executable logic, external data handling, or dynamic code.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected. All reports agree on the benign nature, and the code does not exhibit any malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code is purely structural.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The malware score should remain at **0.0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0.0**.\n- The overall security risk is **0.0**.\n\n**Additional note:** The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
