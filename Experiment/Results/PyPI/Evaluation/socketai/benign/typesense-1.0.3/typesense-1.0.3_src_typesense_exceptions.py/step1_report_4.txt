  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Typesense client library.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; exception classes do not perform data transmission or external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no runtime data flow; only class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of class definitions for exception handling, all inheriting from base exception classes. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The structure is standard and intended for error categorization within a client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is purely structural, serving to categorize errors in the Typesense client.",
