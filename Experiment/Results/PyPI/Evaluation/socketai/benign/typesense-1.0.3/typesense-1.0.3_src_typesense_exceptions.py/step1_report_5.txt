  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Typesense client.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists solely of class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, input/output, or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from source to sink because the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs; the code is straightforward and follows standard Python conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for a Python client library. Each class inherits from a base exception class, providing specific error types for API interactions. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no network operations, or handling of sensitive data. The structure and content are consistent with typical exception class definitions, with appropriate docstrings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a Python client library. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be purely structural with no hidden malicious functionality.",
