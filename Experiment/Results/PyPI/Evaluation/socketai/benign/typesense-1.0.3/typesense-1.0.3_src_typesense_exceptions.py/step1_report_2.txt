  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in the Typesense client.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance, and docstrings within the code.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising points within the application where these classes would be instantiated, though not shown here.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes during error handling processes based on specific error conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. No dynamic execution, external data reading, or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, extending a base error class. All classes are standard Python exception subclasses with descriptive docstrings. No data input, output, or external resource handling is present. The structure appears straightforward and typical for error handling modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden functions. The code's purpose is purely to provide a structured way to handle errors related to the Typesense API. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign module defining custom exception classes for a client library. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
