  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Typesense client to handle various API error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are purely definitional with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in and base custom errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, external communications, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure is straightforward, and the code appears to be a standard pattern for defining exceptions in a Python project. Since there are no external data sources or sinks, and the classes are purely for error representation, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for use within the Typesense client library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
