  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific API errors in the Typesense client.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime flows; the classes serve as error types for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with clear class hierarchies and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a base error class, serving as custom exceptions for API error handling. There is no dynamic code, external data processing, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The structure is standard and benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. The code is purely structural and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
