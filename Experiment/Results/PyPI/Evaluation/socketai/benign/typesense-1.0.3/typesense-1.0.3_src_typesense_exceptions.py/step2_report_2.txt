  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or runtime behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there is no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code is purely structural and contains no security-sensitive operations.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains only class definitions for error handling with no runtime logic, no external data, and no obfuscation, a higher risk score is unwarranted. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious activity, hidden code, or backdoors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's static analysis, avoiding unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a Python client library. No security issues, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0.0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
