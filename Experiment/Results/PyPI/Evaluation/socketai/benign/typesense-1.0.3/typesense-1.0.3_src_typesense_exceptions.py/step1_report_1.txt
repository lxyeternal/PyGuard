  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Typesense client to handle specific API error scenarios.",
  "sources": "None (This is a class definition module; no input or external data reading occurs).",
  "sinks": "None (No data is processed or transmitted; exception classes are used for control flow and error reporting).",
  "flows": "None (No source-to-sink data flow present in class definitions).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures detected; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in a Typesense client. All classes inherit from a base error class, which in turn extends IOError. The classes are simple and contain only docstrings, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The design is typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a client library. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security issues present.",
