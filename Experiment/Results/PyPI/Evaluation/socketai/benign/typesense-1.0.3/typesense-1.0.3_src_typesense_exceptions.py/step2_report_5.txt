  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or any malicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, secrets, or runtime logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and purely structural.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - Security Risk: 0.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n   - No reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0.0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the actual code content.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - They reflect the benign, structural nature of the code.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for a client library. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation issues.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
