  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines a straightforward hierarchy of custom exception classes with no dynamic or malicious code. The purpose is clear, and there are no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0. These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard class definitions with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; purely class definitions, no external interactions or dynamic code.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct; benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern; standard exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Identical assessment; straightforward, non-malicious class definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.  \n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security risk:** None evident; no secrets, no external calls, no dynamic code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious behavior detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible, so **0.0** is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a Python client library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
