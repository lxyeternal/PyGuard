{
  "purpose": "The code manages override operations in a Typesense collection, including creating, retrieving, and updating overrides via API calls.",
  "sources": "API call methods (put, get) from ApiCall class, class initialization, and internal method _endpoint_path.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (self.api_call.put, self.api_call.get) which send data over the network to the Typesense server.",
  "flows": "Input override_id and schema data are used in upsert; retrieve() fetches data; _endpoint_path constructs URL paths for API calls; data flows from input to API request methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard API operations with proper type hinting and API path construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing overrides via API calls. It uses standard libraries, dynamic class instantiation, and API interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The API interactions are typical for managing resources on a server. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code appears well-structured and intended for legitimate API resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client module for managing collection overrides in Typesense. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its security risk and malware scores are very low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
