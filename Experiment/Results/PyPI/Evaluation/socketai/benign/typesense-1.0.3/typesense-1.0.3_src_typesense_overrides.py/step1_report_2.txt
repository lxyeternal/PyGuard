{
  "purpose": "This module manages overrides for a Typesense collection via API calls, providing methods to create, retrieve, and update overrides.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'override_id' and 'schema'. It also utilizes the 'api_call' object to perform API requests.",
  "sinks": "API requests to 'put' and 'get' endpoints through the 'api_call' object are the main sinks where data is sent to external services.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'override_id', 'schema') flow into API request methods ('upsert' and 'retrieve'), which construct endpoint URLs and send data via 'api_call'.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Usage of 'Override' objects and API calls is typical for SDKs. No obfuscated code or malicious control flows are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing overrides via API requests. It uses standard practices for constructing endpoints and managing internal override instances. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is present. The API interaction is straightforward, and there are no indications of malicious intent. The code operates within expected boundaries of an SDK module for API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK module for managing API resources with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard API requests to create, update, and retrieve data related to overrides. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
