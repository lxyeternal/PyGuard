  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose—managing overrides via API calls.\n- **Sinks:** API calls (`put`, `get`) to external server.\n- **Flow:** Input parameters flow into API request methods; endpoint path is dynamically constructed.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses typical API interaction patterns, with no backdoors or data exfiltration.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to external API interactions)  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Score Reasoning:** Given the code is a straightforward API client, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; manages overrides via API.\n- **Sinks & Flow:** API requests are the main data sinks; data flows from parameters into API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; standard SDK behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low) — possibly reflecting cautiousness but still reasonable.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; manages overrides with API calls.\n- **Sinks & Flow:** Standard API request pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks identified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same; API wrapper for overrides.\n- **Sinks & Flow:** Uses API call methods; data flows into network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard API client code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0 — appropriate for benign SDK code.  \n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; manages override data via API.\n- **Sinks & Flow:** API requests are the main data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears secure, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate for typical API interaction code.  \n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** All scores are consistent with the nature of the code, which is a standard API client SDK module.\n- **Malware Justification:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present; malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\nBased on all reports and the code review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, typical for SDK modules that perform API requests.\n\n**Note:** These scores reflect the code's benign nature, lack of suspicious patterns, and straightforward API interaction.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for managing collection overrides in Typesense. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment.",
