  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose—managing overrides via API calls. Sources (API methods, class init, internal methods) are accurate.\n- **Sinks:** API calls (`put`, `get`) are correctly identified as data sinks.\n- **Flows:** Input parameters flow into API requests as described.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment that this is a typical API client with no malicious behavior is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, due to API interactions). These seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes standard API management.\n- **Sinks:** API requests are the main data sinks.\n- **Flows:** Input parameters into API calls, as described.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just an SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still low). Slightly higher but still reasonable considering the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar observations—standard API wrapper, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2. Slightly higher but acceptable given API interactions.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Again, standard API client, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.0. The lowest risk, fitting the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion—legitimate API wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1. Slightly above zero but reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware scores are appropriately low (0 or near 0).\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly identified as 0 across all reports; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK module for managing collection overrides via API calls.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- The API interactions are standard, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with low, API-related risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.
