  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected API interactions for managing overrides. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis."
