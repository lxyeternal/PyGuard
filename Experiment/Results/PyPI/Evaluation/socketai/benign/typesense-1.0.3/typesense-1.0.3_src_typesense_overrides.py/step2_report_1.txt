  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the evidence for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages override operations via API calls; standard, well-structured, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, typical of an SDK module.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code appears to be a straightforward API client with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard API interactions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still very low.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the code's purpose as a standard API wrapper, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion — standard API wrapper, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code's purpose as a legitimate API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate zero, and the code contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on clarity; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports, consistent with a standard SDK module.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured API client module for managing collection overrides in Typesense.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL manipulations, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n- The API interactions are straightforward, delegating network requests to an external `ApiCall` class.\n- The code's purpose aligns with legitimate SDK functionality.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and maintainable.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — negligible, typical of SDK modules handling API requests.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or security issues. The low scores assigned by the reports are justified and should remain as is.",
