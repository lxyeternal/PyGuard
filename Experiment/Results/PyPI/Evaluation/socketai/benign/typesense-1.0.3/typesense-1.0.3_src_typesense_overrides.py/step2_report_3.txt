  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard API client for managing overrides.\n- Sources/Sinks: API call methods (put, get).\n- Flows: Input parameters flow into API requests.\n- Anomalies: None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Well-structured, typical SDK code; no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: No malware or security risk; scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate.\n- Confidence: High (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions.\n- No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- Scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) seem reasonable.\n- Confidence: Slightly lower but still high (0.9).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: straightforward API wrapper, no anomalies.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent with benign SDK code.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Continues the pattern: API call management, no suspicious code.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Scores align with benign API client code.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, standard API interaction.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports describe standard API client code for managing collection overrides.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified; the code appears correct and well-structured.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected. The code is purely for API interactions, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No evidence of obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily related to standard API usage; no secrets or backdoors.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are aligned with the analysis—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** can be slightly increased from 0.1–0.2 to around **0.2–0.3** if we want to reflect the minimal external dependency and network interactions, but given the benign nature, keeping it low is acceptable.\n- Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (reflecting minimal external API interaction but no real security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured API client for managing collection overrides in Typesense, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
