{
  "purpose": "Manage override operations within a Typesense collection, including creating, updating, and retrieving overrides via API calls.",
  "sources": "Inputs include override_id, schema objects, and collection_name; API call responses from self.api_call (PUT and GET methods).",
  "sinks": "The API call responses could contain sensitive data; the code itself does not write or send data outside of API calls.",
  "flows": "Input override_id and schema flow into API calls (upsert method), responses return override data; retrieve method fetches all overrides.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code uses standard API request patterns and standard library features. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code manages override data via API calls, constructing endpoint URLs dynamically. It uses type hints, standard Python imports, and makes API requests using a provided ApiCall object. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious logic are evident. The code’s structure and logic are consistent with legitimate API interaction patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to perform its stated purpose securely, with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate module for managing overrides in a Typesense collection. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and no security risks are detected beyond typical API interaction. It appears secure and well-structured.",
