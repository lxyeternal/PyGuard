  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages override operations via API calls, which is accurate.\n- **Sinks:** API methods (`put`, `get`) are typical data send points.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious control flow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears standard SDK code for API resource management. No malware or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk is minimal given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9). The reasoning aligns with the first, emphasizing the standard API interactions and absence of malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar assessment: standard API wrapper code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but the same reasoning applies.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Again, standard API interaction code, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: legitimate API wrapper, no malware or obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is a straightforward API client for managing collection overrides, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The security risk is low, primarily because this code interacts with an external API and does not perform any insecure or suspicious operations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly conservative but reasonable at around 0.1–0.2, considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (standard API client, no known vulnerabilities, minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected API interactions without security concerns.",
