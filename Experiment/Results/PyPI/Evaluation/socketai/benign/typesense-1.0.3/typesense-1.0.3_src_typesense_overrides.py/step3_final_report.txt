{
  "purpose": "The code manages override operations via API calls for a Typesense collection, providing methods to create, update, and retrieve overrides.",
  "sources": "API call methods (`put`, `get`) within the `ApiCall` class, class initialization parameters, and internal methods constructing endpoint paths.",
  "sinks": "External API requests made through `self.api_call.put` and `self.api_call.get`, which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as `override_id` and `schema` flow into API request bodies and endpoint URL construction, leading to network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module for managing collection overrides via API calls. It uses clear, standard patterns for API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The API methods (`put`, `get`) are typical data sinks, and input parameters flow directly into these requests. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious URL manipulations. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate SDK functionality, and the structure is clean and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected API interactions for managing overrides. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
