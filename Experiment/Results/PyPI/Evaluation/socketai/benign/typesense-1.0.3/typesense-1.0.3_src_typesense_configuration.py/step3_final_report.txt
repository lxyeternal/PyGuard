  "purpose": "Provides configuration management for the Typesense Instance, including URL parsing, validation, and node handling.",
  "sources": "URL parsing via urlparse, configuration dictionary inputs, environment variables (if any), and deprecation warnings.",
  "sinks": "Generation of node URLs, validation routines that do not process untrusted data beyond configuration inputs.",
  "flows": "Input configuration data -> validation -> node initialization -> URL generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data flows detected. Deprecation warnings are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks: URL parsing with validation, node and configuration object creation, and validation routines. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present. The deprecation warnings are informational and do not introduce security risks. The validation ensures required fields are present, and URL parsing is straightforward. The code is readable, well-structured, and follows best practices for configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard configuration management module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors. The malware score is correctly set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
