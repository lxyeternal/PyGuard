{
  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for managing individual analytics rules in Typesense, allowing retrieval and deletion of specific rules via API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'rule_id' parameter used to construct API endpoint URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'api_call.get' and 'api_call.delete' methods act as sinks where untrusted data could potentially lead to API requests; however, they are standard API interactions.",
  "flows": "The 'rule_id' flows into '_endpoint_path' to construct the URL, which then flows into 'api_call.get' and 'api_call.delete' methods to perform API operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AnalyticsRule' that manages API interactions for specific rules identified by 'rule_id'. It constructs endpoint URLs dynamically using an external resource path and invokes standard API call methods. The code uses conditional imports for compatibility and type hints for clarity. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are evident. External dependencies like 'ApiCall' and 'AnalyticsRules.resource_path' are assumed to be standard and benign. The logic is correct, and the code performs expected functions without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for managing analytics rules, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores of 0 are justified.",
