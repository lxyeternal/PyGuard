  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, code behavior, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages analytics rules via API calls, with `rule_id` as input, and uses `api_call.get` and `api_call.delete` as sinks.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Proper flow from `rule_id` to endpoint URL, then to API calls. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and standard imports.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues found, and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates that the class manages API calls for rules, constructs endpoints dynamically, and uses standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no malicious signs or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights that the code reads `rule_id`, constructs endpoints, and calls API methods, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, confirms the code is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that this is a standard API wrapper class for managing analytics rules via network requests.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of **0.1** is appropriate, indicating very low security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo signs of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is a typical, well-structured API client wrapper with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are justified and should not be changed. The overall assessment is that this code is benign, with no security concerns.",
