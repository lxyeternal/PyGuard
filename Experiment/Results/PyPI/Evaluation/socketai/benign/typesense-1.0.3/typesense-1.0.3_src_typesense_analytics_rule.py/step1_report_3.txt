  "purpose": "Provides a class for managing individual analytics rules in Typesense via API calls, including retrieving and deleting rules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check; self.api_call for API interactions; self.rule_id for rule identification.",
  "sinks": "self.api_call.get and self.api_call.delete methods which perform network requests; constructing endpoint path in _endpoint_path.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets api_call and rule_id; retrieve uses self.api_call.get to fetch data; delete uses self.api_call.delete; endpoint path is constructed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data, or unusual code constructs observed. The code uses standard Python modules and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class that manages analytics rules via network requests. It uses standard Python typing and conditional imports for compatibility. The API call methods are typical wrappers for network interactions and do not contain embedded malicious code. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The dynamic import of AnalyticsRules.resource_path is standard and safe. Overall, the code performs authorized API interactions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a secure API wrapper class for managing analytics rules. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, standard application code.",
