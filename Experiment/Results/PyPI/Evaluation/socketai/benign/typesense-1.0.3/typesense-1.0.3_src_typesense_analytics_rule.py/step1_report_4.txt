{
  "purpose": "The module manages individual analytics rules in Typesense, providing methods to retrieve and delete specific rules via API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'rule_id' parameter during object initialization and the 'self._endpoint_path' property to construct API endpoint URLs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'api_call.get' and 'api_call.delete' methods, which send requests to external APIs with constructed URLs and parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data 'rule_id' flows from object instantiation into '_endpoint_path' property, which constructs the URL; then, the 'retrieve' and 'delete' methods send API requests using these URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and well-structured. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The imports and method calls are standard and typical for API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The module defines an API client class for managing analytics rules, with clear and standard methods for retrieving and deleting rules via API calls. The URL construction dynamically combines a resource path and rule ID. No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is found. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors; it relies on the passed 'ApiCall' object to perform network requests. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for such API wrapper modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for managing analytics rules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for interacting with an external API. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
