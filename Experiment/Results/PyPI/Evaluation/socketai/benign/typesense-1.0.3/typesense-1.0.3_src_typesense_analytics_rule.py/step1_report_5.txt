{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to manage individual analytics rules via the Typesense API, including retrieving and deleting rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typesense.api_call, and typesense.types.analytics_rule modules; uses API call methods within class functions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written or sent over the network directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the class with api_call and rule_id; retrieve method calls api_call.get with endpoint path; delete method calls api_call.delete with endpoint path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for API wrapper modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing analytics rules through a REST API. It initializes with an API call handler and rule ID. Retrieval and deletion methods invoke API methods without processing untrusted input beyond parameters used for API calls. Endpoint path construction uses an imported resource path and the rule ID, which are standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code leverages type hinting and conditional imports for compatibility but does not perform any insecure operations or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard API requests for retrieving and deleting analytics rules, with no suspicious code or potential malware indications.",
