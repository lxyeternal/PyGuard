  "purpose": "Manage individual analytics rules in Typesense via API calls, including retrieval and deletion.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typesense.api_call, and typesense.types.analytics_rule; class methods accessing API endpoints.",
  "targets": "API call methods (get, delete) which send requests to the server; property constructing endpoint URL.",
  "flows": "Initialization of AnalyticsRule object -> calling retrieve or delete -> API request sent to server with constructed endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic execution, no obfuscated code present. Use of type hinting and dynamic import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing analytics rules via API calls, with methods for retrieval and deletion. It uses standard imports and constructs API endpoint URLs dynamically. No hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, no suspicious network activities, and no backdoors are present. The imports, methods, and properties function as intended for API interaction without malicious intent. No anomalies such as malicious code snippets or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client class for managing analytics rules. It performs typical operations with no signs of malicious or maliciously designed code. The overall security risk is very low, and the code appears benign and functional.",
