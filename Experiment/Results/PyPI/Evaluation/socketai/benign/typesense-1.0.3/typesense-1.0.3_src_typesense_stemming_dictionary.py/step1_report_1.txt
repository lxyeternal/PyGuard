{
  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve individual stemming dictionaries in Typesense via API calls.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with api_call object and dict_id; the retrieve() method makes an API GET request.",
  "sinks": "The api_call.get method, which makes an HTTP request to the constructed endpoint.",
  "flows": "The retrieve() method calls api_call.get with the endpoint path, returning a response containing the dictionary details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing stemming dictionaries through API requests. It constructs an endpoint URL dynamically based on a resource path and dictionary ID, then performs a GET request to retrieve data. No user input is directly processed within the retrieve() method, and the endpoint construction appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The class relies on external libraries and expected API schemas, which are typical for such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API client wrapper for managing stemming dictionaries in Typesense. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It follows normal design patterns for API interaction without signs of sabotage or malware.",
