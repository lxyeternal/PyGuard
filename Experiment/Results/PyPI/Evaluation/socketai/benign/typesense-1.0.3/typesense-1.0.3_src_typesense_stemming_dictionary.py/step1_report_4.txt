  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve individual stemming dictionaries in Typesense via API interactions.",
  "sources": "API call response from self.api_call.get()",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or data leaks; no unsafe operations",
  "flows": "API call response -> returned schema object; no external data flow to other systems or files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated parts, and no unusual dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class wrapper around an API call to retrieve a specific stemming dictionary. It relies on an external ApiCall object for making HTTP requests, and constructs endpoint paths dynamically. The response is returned as a schema object. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual logic detected. The module appears to be a clean, standard API client wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard API interactions to retrieve data; there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical implementation of an API client class without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
