  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for managing stemming dictionaries. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity. The scores seem appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a note that the URL construction depends on external input (`dict_id`). The potential risk is minimal, related to URL manipulation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slight securityRisk score (0.2) reflects the potential for URL manipulation if `dict_id` is untrusted. This is reasonable, as the code does not validate `dict_id`. No malware detected. The reasoning is sound.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard API client, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious behavior; straightforward API call wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSlightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) due to potential issues with external data, but overall minimal. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no malicious activity, standard API wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (~0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for URL manipulation if `dict_id` is untrusted. No actual vulnerabilities are demonstrated, just acknowledgment of typical risks in dynamic URL construction.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature, I would assign a **security risk score of approximately 0.1** overall, considering the potential for URL manipulation if `dict_id` is untrusted, but nothing more serious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard API client wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- The potential security concern (score ~0.1) is justified by the external input (`dict_id`) being used in URL construction without validation, but this is typical for such code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe scores should remain low, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a security risk around 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical API wrapper risks.",
