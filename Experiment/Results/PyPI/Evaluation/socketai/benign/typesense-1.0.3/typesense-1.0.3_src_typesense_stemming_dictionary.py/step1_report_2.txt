  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve individual stemming dictionaries in Typesense via API calls.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (api_call, dict_id); retrieve() method calling self.api_call.get; self._endpoint_path property constructing URL.",
  "sinks": "self.api_call.get method acts as sink where untrusted data could be used for API request; endpoint URL is built from dict_id, which could be manipulated if not validated.",
  "flows": "Constructor stores api_call and dict_id; retrieve() calls self.api_call.get with constructed endpoint; endpoint URL includes dict_id which could be manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. No obfuscated code. The only potentially risky part is the URL construction if dict_id is untrusted, but that is typical API behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing stemming dictionaries with clear API interaction. The retrieve method makes an API GET request to a constructed endpoint, which is based on an externally provided dict_id. The URL construction is straightforward and based on the resource path plus dict_id. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leakage. The code relies on external inputs (api_call, dict_id) but handles them normally. There are no network anomalies, data leaks, or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate API client class for managing stemming dictionaries. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected beyond typical URL construction based on external input, which is expected in such API wrapper classes.",
