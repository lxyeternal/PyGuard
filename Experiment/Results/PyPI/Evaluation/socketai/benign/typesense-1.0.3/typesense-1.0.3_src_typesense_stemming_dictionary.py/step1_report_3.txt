  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve individual stemming dictionaries in Typesense via API interactions.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with api_call and dict_id; retrieve method calling self.api_call.get() to fetch data.",
  "sinks": "The self.api_call.get() function, which sends an HTTP GET request to the constructed endpoint path.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the object -> calling retrieve() -> executing api_call.get() -> data fetched from endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious API calls, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to interact with a Typesense API for managing stemming dictionaries. It uses standard class design, type hinting, and property methods. The retrieve method performs a typical API GET request through the provided ApiCall instance, constructing the endpoint path dynamically based on the dictionary ID. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present. The imported modules are standard for API interactions, and the overall structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard API client implementation for managing stemming dictionaries in Typesense. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
