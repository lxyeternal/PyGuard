  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense, providing methods to create, update, retrieve, and access stopword sets.",
  "sources": "Network calls via self.api_call.put and self.api_call.get to the external Typesense API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "External API endpoints; no untrusted data sinks within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Method calls such as upsert and retrieve invoke API calls that send or receive data from the external service.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The sys.version_info check is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with standard network interactions, internal caching, and no malicious or suspicious logic. It does not handle sensitive data directly nor perform insecure operations. The network calls are typical for such modules, and the code structure is clear and readable. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The high security risk scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; the appropriate risk score is 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
