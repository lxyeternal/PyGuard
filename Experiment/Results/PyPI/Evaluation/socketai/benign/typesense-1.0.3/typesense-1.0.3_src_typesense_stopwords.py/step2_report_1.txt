  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is an API client wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense.\n- Uses standard API call patterns (`put`, `get`) to interact with an external service.\n- Maintains internal cache of stopword sets.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- Network interactions are typical for such an API wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.9 seems high.\n- **Justification for high risk?** The report states no malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious logic. The code is a straightforward API wrapper.\n- **Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**; the current score overstates the security concern.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 1 is unjustified.\n- **Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; network calls are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 is slightly high but still low.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent, just normal API interactions.\n- **Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward API wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Clearly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The high scores (especially 0.9 and 1) are unjustified given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Network interactions are typical for such modules.\n- No sensitive data handling, no backdoors, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern warranting a score above 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports, especially the high risk scores, should be revised downward to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
