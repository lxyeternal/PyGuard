  "purpose": "Manage stopwords in Typesense by creating, updating, and retrieving stopwords sets through API calls.",
  "sources": "API calls via self.api_call (put and get methods), reading sys.version_info, and importing modules.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (put and get), potentially sending data to external services.",
  "flows": "Inputs from method parameters and sys.version_info flow into API request methods, which send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected. Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is benign. No indication of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing stopwords in an external system via API calls. It includes standard methods for creating/updating and retrieving data. The API calls use provided schemas and do not include any suspicious logic or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network behaviors, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper with no obfuscated elements or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client implementation for managing stopwords in Typesense. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No signs of malware or security issues are detected.",
