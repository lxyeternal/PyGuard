  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are identified.\n- The code interacts with external APIs via `self.api_call.put` and `self.api_call.get`, which is typical for such modules.\n- The network interactions are limited to intended API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not handle sensitive data directly, nor does it perform insecure operations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Malware Score\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or signs of malware.\n- Given the code's straightforward nature, API interactions, and lack of obfuscation, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware.\n\n### Obfuscated Score\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, correctly noting the code is clear and standard.\n- No obfuscation techniques or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n### Security Risk Score\n- Most reports assign a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n- The only report with a slightly higher score (0.2) (Report 3) is still within a minimal range, possibly reflecting the network interaction with external API endpoints.\n- Since the code does not handle secrets or perform risky operations, a score around 0.1-0.2 is justified.\n\n### Logic and Reasoning\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and standard is sound.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** approximately 0.1 to 0.2 (most reports agree on 0.1-0.2)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard API client module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is justified.\n\n**Summary estimate:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus of the reports and the code review.",
