  "purpose": "Provides functionality for managing stopwords in Typesense, including creating, updating, retrieving stopwords sets, and accessing individual stopwords set objects.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, ApiCall, StopwordsSet, stopword schemas), environment info (sys.version_info). Uses parameters in methods for API interactions.",
  "sinks": "API calls to '/stopwords' endpoint via self.api_call (put, get). Data flows from method parameters to API request bodies or responses.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (stopwords_set_id, stopwords_set) flow into API call bodies or dict keys, responses from API calls are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual control flows. The code appears standard for API wrapper functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing stopwords with methods for CRUD operations, utilizing an API call abstraction. It employs standard patterns for API interaction, including caching StopwordsSet objects. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of environment info (sys.version_info) for conditional imports is benign. All data flows are directly tied to API requests/responses. No hidden or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical design patterns without suspicious anomalies.",
