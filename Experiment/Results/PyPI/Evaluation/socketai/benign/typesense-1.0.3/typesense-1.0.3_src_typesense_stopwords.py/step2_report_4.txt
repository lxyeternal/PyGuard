  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose and sources are standard; no anomalies or suspicious logic.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risk indicated.\n- The confidence level is high (0.9), and the analysis concludes the code is safe.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity. The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating certainty.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security issues detected. Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, standard API wrapper pattern.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2), possibly due to network interactions.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The minor securityRisk score seems justified given network communication, but no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis; no anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), consistent with typical API calls.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern; standard API wrapper, no suspicious activity.\n- SecurityRisk score (0.1) is consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description; no anomalies or suspicious logic are present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2) mostly due to network interactions, which is reasonable for API wrapper code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward API client for managing stopwords in Typesense.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The network interactions are typical and do not pose security risks in this context.\n- The minor security risk scores reflect the potential exposure inherent in networked API calls but are not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for API interaction code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no security risks or malware present.",
