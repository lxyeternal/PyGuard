  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for managing stopwords in Typesense. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The high security risk scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; the appropriate risk score is 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
