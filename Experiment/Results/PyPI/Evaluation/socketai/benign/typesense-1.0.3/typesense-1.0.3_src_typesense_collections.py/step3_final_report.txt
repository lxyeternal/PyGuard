{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for managing collections in the Typesense API, including creating, retrieving, and accessing individual collections.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys for version info; uses 'typesense' modules for API calls and schemas.",
  "sinks": "API calls via 'ApiCall' object for network requests.",
  "flows": "Method parameters to API calls, responses to return values, dictionary caching for collections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK component managing collections through API interactions. It uses typical patterns for creating, retrieving, and accessing collections, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The API calls are standard, and data flows are straightforward. No suspicious or anomalous code segments are present. The code relies on external classes and schemas, which are outside the scope but assumed secure. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module for managing Typesense collections. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The code can be considered safe for use.",
