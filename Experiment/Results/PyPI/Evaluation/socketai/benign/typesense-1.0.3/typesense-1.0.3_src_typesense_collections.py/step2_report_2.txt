  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard collection management functions.\n- Sources: Reads from sys for version detection; uses 'typesense' modules.\n- Sinks: API calls via 'ApiCall'—standard.\n- Flows: Data from schemas to API, API responses to return.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical API wrapper, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Low risk, benign code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and structure.\n- Sources: Conditional imports, API calls.\n- Sinks: API network calls.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, standard practices.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar overall findings.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Well-structured, typical API client.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard API wrapper, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign SDK code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports indicate no malware (score=0). The code is a straightforward SDK module, making API calls to manage collections.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports assign obfuscated=0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with standard SDK code.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The overall security risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code relies on external API calls, which could be malicious if the API endpoint or 'ApiCall' implementation is compromised. However, based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n- The use of conditional imports and standard API patterns is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** **0.1** (very low, standard SDK code)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK module for managing collections via the Typesense API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
