{
  "purpose": "This code imports a Client class from a local module and sets a version string, likely as part of a Python package initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (`.client`), setting the `__version__` variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data or untrusted input is processed or output",
  "flows": "The import and version assignment are independent; no data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and assigns a version string. There are no runtime data flows, no user input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The import uses a relative import, which is common in package modules. The `__version__` variable is standard for package versioning. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer with standard imports and version assignment. No malicious or security-related concerns are evident.",
