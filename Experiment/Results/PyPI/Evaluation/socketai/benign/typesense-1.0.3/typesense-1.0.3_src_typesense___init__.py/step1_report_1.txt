{
  "purpose": "This code imports a Client class and sets a version string, likely part of a larger Python package module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .client import Client",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling or output mechanisms",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code simply imports and sets a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module and defines a version string. There are no suspicious or complex operations, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, nor network activities. The import is from a local module, which is standard. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module file. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
