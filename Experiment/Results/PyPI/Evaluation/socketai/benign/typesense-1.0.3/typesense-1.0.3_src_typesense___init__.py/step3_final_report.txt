  "purpose": "Import a Client class from a local module and set the package version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .client module, static version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from local module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static import and version assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import from a local module and setting a version string. There are no dynamic operations, no external inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The import is from a relative module, typical for package initialization files. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity aligns with standard package structure, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no security concerns or malicious intent. All previous reports correctly identified this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
