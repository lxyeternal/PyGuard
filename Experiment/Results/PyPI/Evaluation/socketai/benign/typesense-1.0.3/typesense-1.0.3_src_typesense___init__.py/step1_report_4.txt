{
  "purpose": "The code imports a Client class from a local module and defines a version string, likely for a package or module metadata.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .client import Client, and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output is performed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and assigns a string",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The import is standard, and version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Client class from a relative module, indicating modular code structure. The __version__ string specifies the package version. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling. The code is minimal and appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import with version declaration, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
