{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a small module that imports a Client class from a local submodule and defines a version string, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the import statement which loads 'Client' from a local module, and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the import and version assignment are static and internal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The import statement is straightforward; the version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets a version string, typical for package modules. No external data sources, no input handling, and no operations that process untrusted data. The structure and content are minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard snippet of a Python package's initialization or module file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
