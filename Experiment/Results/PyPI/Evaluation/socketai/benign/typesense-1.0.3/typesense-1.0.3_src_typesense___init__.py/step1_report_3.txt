  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent in this snippet; the import is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Client from a local module, which is common in package setup. It defines a version string. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious operations, no network activity, or suspicious logic present. The minimal code suggests standard package structure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, performing a typical import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
