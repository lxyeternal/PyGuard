{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates using Azure's Schema Registry and JSON Schema encoding/decoding with async operations, primarily for registering schemas and encoding/decoding EventData messages.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and namespace, JSON schema for schema registration, user-defined dicts for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoded EventData bodies, decoded JSON content, print statements displaying encoded/decoded data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> credential creation -> schema registration -> encoding functions -> event data generation -> decoding functions -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; standard use of SDKs and environment variables. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script securely retrieves credentials from environment variables, registers a schema with Azure Schema Registry, encodes sample data into EventData objects, and decodes them back. Uses async SDKs appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, no suspicious network calls or backdoors. The code handles data securely, with proper schema registration and caching, and performs expected operations for data serialization/deserialization. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of schema registry usage for encoding and decoding event data. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall structure and data handling appear safe and intentional.",
