{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates authenticating with Azure, registering a JSON schema with Azure Schema Registry, encoding data into EventData messages, and decoding them back using Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and namespace; hardcoded schema JSON definition.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external untrusted endpoints or written to files.",
  "flows": "Credentials are used to authenticate to Azure services; schema registration flows from code to Azure; encoding and decoding involve in-memory data processing without external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets are not present, and the environment variables are standard for Azure SDK authentication. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDK patterns for authentication, schema registration, and encoding/decoding of JSON data. No hardcoded credentials are found; environment variables handle secrets. The schema JSON is a typical object schema, not malicious. Data flows involve standard Azure service interactions, with no indications of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The functions for encoding and decoding are straightforward and utilize SDK caching, with no malicious logic or external network connections beyond Azure SDK interactions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscated segments, or potential supply chain risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example for Azure Schema Registry operations, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It uses standard SDK practices for cloud credential management and data encoding/decoding. Overall security risk is minimal.",
