  "purpose": "This script demonstrates encoding and decoding JSON schema-validated event data asynchronously using Azure Schema Registry and Event Hub, with schema registration and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP); Azure SDK credentials; Hardcoded JSON schema.",
  "sinks": "Encoded EventData bodies; Decoded content; Potential network communication with Azure services.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials and configuration → Credential object used to authenticate with Azure → Schema registration and encoding/decoding operations communicate with Azure Schema Registry → Encoded/decoded data flows through the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials beyond environment variables; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; straightforward use of Azure SDK. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code properly uses environment variables for sensitive data, interacts with Azure services for schema registration and encoding, and handles async operations securely. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The data encoding and decoding appear to be standard processes for schema validation, with no signs of data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code. Overall, the code implements a legitimate workflow for Azure schema registry integration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of asynchronous schema registration, encoding, and decoding with Azure SDK. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a normal, well-structured sample for schema management in event-driven architectures.",
