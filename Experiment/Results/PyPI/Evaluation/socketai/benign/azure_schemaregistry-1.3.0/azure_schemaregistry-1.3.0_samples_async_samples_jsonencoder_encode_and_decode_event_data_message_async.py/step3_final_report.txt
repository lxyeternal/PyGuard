  "purpose": "This script demonstrates Azure SDK usage for schema registration, encoding, and decoding of JSON data using asynchronous operations and environment-based credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials, SDK functions for schema registration, encoding, and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK calls for schema registration and data encoding/decoding; no external data leaks or network activity beyond Azure services.",
  "flows": "Credentials are obtained from environment variables; schema is registered and cached; data is encoded into EventData objects; then decoded back to original content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDK practices for schema management and data serialization. It reads credentials from environment variables, performs schema registration, encodes sample data, and decodes it, all within expected SDK workflows. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured example of Azure schema registry usage with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
