{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the process of authenticating with Azure, registering a JSON schema, encoding data into EventData messages, and decoding them using Azure Schema Registry and Event Hub libraries.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and namespace; schema registration and encoding functions; input dictionaries for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoding functions, print statements, and Azure SDK calls that handle data and schema information.",
  "flows": "Credentials are retrieved from environment variables; schema is registered; data is encoded into EventData objects; encoded content and types are printed; encoded data is decoded back to JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all credentials are sourced from environment variables. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script follows standard Azure SDK usage patterns for schema registration, encoding, and decoding. It handles credentials securely via environment variables, performs schema registration and caching efficiently, and manages async operations appropriately. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose aligns with typical data serialization and deserialization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sample for Azure Schema Registry and Event Hub integration with proper security practices. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
