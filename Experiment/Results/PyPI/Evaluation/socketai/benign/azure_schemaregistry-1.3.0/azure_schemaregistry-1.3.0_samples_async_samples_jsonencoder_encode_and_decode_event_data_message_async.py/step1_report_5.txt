{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates authenticating with Azure, registering a JSON schema with Azure Schema Registry, encoding data according to the schema, and decoding the data, mainly for use with Azure Event Hub.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for Azure credentials and schema registry details; the predefined SCHEMA_JSON object containing schema details; input data dictionaries for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoding functions and decoding functions using Azure SDK; data outputs via print statements.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials and configuration; credentials are used to authenticate and interact with Azure services; data is encoded using the schema, then decoded back to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond environment variables. The code uses Azure SDKs as intended. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves credentials from environment variables, authenticates with Azure, registers schemas, and encodes/decodes JSON data following standard SDK practices. It utilizes asynchronous programming correctly, manages schema registration and caching efficiently, and performs expected data serialization/deserialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system tampering, or backdoors. The print statements are for debugging or demonstration purposes only, not indicative of malicious intent. All SDKs and APIs used are standard and documented. No suspicious network activity or credential harvesting mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate demonstration of Azure schema registry and event data encoding/decoding, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and does not exhibit anomalies or malicious patterns.",
