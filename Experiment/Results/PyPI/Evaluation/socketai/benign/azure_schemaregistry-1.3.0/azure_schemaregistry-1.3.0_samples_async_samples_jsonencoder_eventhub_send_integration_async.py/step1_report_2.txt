  "purpose": "The code demonstrates asynchronously sending encoded JSON schema-based event data to Azure Event Hub, with schema registration and credential management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EVENT_HUB_CONN_STR, EVENT_HUB_NAME, SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP) for configuration; user-defined schema JSON object; and Azure credential acquisition.",
  "sinks": "Azure Event Hub for data transmission; Azure Schema Registry for schema registration; Azure identity service for token acquisition.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup; schema registration via SchemaRegistryClient; data encoding with JsonSchemaEncoder; data sent through EventHubProducerClient; credentials are used for authentication; all data flows through legitimate Azure SDK functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic code execution; no suspicious external network connections; no hardcoded sensitive data; use of standard Azure SDK libraries for cloud communication; no hidden backdoors or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages Azure credentials, registers JSON schemas, encodes data with these schemas, and sends data asynchronously to Event Hub. It uses environment variables for configuration, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The schema registration and encoding follow Azure SDK best practices. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed, and all network interactions are with Azure services. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate Azure event data sender with schema management and credential handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and follows proper credential management practices.",
