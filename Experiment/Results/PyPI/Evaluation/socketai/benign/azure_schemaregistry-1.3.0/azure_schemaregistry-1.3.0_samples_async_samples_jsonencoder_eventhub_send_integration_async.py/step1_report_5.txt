  "purpose": "This script demonstrates sending JSON-encoded event data asynchronously to Azure Event Hubs with schema registration and encoding via Azure Schema Registry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and other credentials; JSON schema definition within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of encoded event data to Azure Event Hubs; potential schema registration calls.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and schema JSON are read as sources; encoded data is sent via network to Event Hubs; schema registration flows through Azure SDK APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; usage of environment variables for sensitive data; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures; straightforward schema registration and data sending.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for Azure Event Hub data ingestion with schema registry integration. It reads configuration from environment variables, registers schemas, encodes data, and sends it asynchronously. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure is clear, and it utilizes official SDKs appropriately. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected. The only potentially sensitive parts are environment variables, which are standard practice for configuration.\n\nOverall, the script performs legitimate operations related to cloud event data sending with schema management, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical, well-structured Azure Event Hub data sender with schema registry integration. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks beyond standard configuration handling. The usage of environment variables for secrets and SDK functions is appropriate. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
