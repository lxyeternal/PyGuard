  "purpose": "The script demonstrates sending JSON-encoded event data asynchronously to an Azure Event Hub, with schema registration and encoding via Azure Schema Registry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and credentials; the JSON schema definition within the code; runtime functions that generate event data.",
  "sinks": "Sending batched encoded event data to Azure Event Hub over network; potential schema registration with Azure Schema Registry.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Credential objects → Schema registration and encoding → Event data creation and encoding → EventHub client sending data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; schema definition appears standard; no obfuscated code or hidden logic. Usage of environment variables aligns with common practice; no anomalous data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely accesses environment variables for sensitive connection info. Uses Azure SDKs properly with asynchronous calls. Schema registration and encoding follow documented patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code performs standard event publishing with schema validation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network activities are evident. The schema is a typical JSON schema with no malicious payload. The overall flow and structure are straightforward and adhere to best practices. There is no suspicious or malicious logic, and no obfuscation or malicious code snippets detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sample for sending encoded events to Azure Event Hub with schema validation. No malicious activity or sabotage evident. It follows standard SDK usage patterns without any suspicious behavior.",
