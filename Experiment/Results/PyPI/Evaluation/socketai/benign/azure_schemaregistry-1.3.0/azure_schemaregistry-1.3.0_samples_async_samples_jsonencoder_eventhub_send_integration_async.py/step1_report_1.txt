  "purpose": "The script demonstrates asynchronously sending JSON-encoded event data to Azure Event Hubs with schema registry integration, including schema registration and content encoding.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EVENT_HUB_CONN_STR, EVENT_HUB_NAME, SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP), user-defined JSON schema, and predefined dictionary content.",
  "sinks": "Sending batched EventData to Azure Event Hub; encoding data with JSON schema encoder.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> schema registration -> encoding of dict content -> sending encoded EventData to Event Hub.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; proper use of async APIs and environment variables; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code securely accesses configuration via environment variables, registers schemas with Azure Schema Registry, encodes data using JSON schema encoder, and sends data to Azure Event Hub. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The schema registration and encoding process appear standard and legitimate. There are no indications of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. All data flows are within Azure SDK operations, with no suspicious external connections or data exfiltration. The code structure and content suggest legitimate usage for Azure event data streaming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example for sending JSON-encoded event data to Azure Event Hubs with schema registry support. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected. Overall, it is a benign and well-structured sample code.",
