{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates receiving events asynchronously from Azure EventHub, decoding them with JSON schema validation, and printing the results for debugging or processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and event hub name; Azure SDKs for EventHub, SchemaRegistry, and credentials; event body data.",
  "sinks": "Printing event payloads and decoded content; resource cleanup and credential closing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK clients -> event reception -> event body -> decoding via JsonSchemaEncoder -> printing decoded content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; straightforward SDK usage; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an Azure Event Hub consumer with schema validation. It reads configuration from environment variables, connects to Azure services, receives events asynchronously, decodes them using Azure Schema Registry, and prints the raw and decoded data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The only minor concern is printing potentially sensitive event data, which is typical for debugging but should be managed carefully in production. The code uses proper resource management and SDKs correctly. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1-0.2, confidence: high) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Azure Event Hub consumer with JSON schema validation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor security concern relates to logging potentially sensitive data, but this is common in debugging scenarios. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices for such applications.",
