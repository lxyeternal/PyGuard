{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates asynchronously receiving and decoding events from Azure Event Hub using JSON schema validation and Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and credentials; event.body content when receiving events.",
  "sinks": "Decoded event content printed to the console; potential data exposure if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "Event data received from Event Hub → Bytes extracted from event.body → Decoded via JsonSchemaEncoder.decode() → Output printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious network connections; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors; no data leaks beyond standard print output.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with Azure services for event processing and schema validation. It reads input from environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. The event data is received asynchronously, decoded using the Azure SDK's JSON Schema encoder, and printed. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The only potential concern is the printing of event payloads, which could leak sensitive data if logs are accessed insecurely, but this is typical for debugging purposes. The code properly manages resources with 'async with' and closes credentials and clients. Overall, the code appears legitimate and aligned with standard Azure SDK usage without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure Event Hub consumer example utilizing JSON schema validation. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It handles event data securely with proper SDK use, and no suspicious activities are present.",
