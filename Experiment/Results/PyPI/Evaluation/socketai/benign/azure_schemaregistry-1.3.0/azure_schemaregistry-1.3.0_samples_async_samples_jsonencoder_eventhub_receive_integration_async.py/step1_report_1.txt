{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates asynchronously receiving and decoding events from Azure Event Hubs using Schema Registry and JSON schema encoding.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema namespace, group name, and credentials; event body from EventData object",
  "sinks": "Printing decoded content to console; no direct data leaks or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "Event body is received, converted to bytes, then decoded via json_schema_encoder.decode(event), which interacts with Azure Schema Registry",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; the use of standard SDKs and environment variables appears normal",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration from environment variables, uses Azure SDKs to connect to Event Hubs and Schema Registry, and decodes incoming events. No data is transmitted or stored maliciously. The decoding process relies on Azure services and does not include any suspicious data handling. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for receiving and decoding Event Hub messages using Azure SDKs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical patterns and only interacts with Azure services as intended.",
