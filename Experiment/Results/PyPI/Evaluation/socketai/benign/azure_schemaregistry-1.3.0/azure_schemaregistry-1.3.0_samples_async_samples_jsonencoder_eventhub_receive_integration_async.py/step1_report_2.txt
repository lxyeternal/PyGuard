{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to asynchronously receive and decode events from Azure Event Hub using Azure's SDKs, with schema validation via Azure Schema Registry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and other configuration; external SDK functions for event reception and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting received data and decoded content; no external data exfiltration or network connections aside from SDK operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK initialization -> EventHubConsumerClient receive method -> event handler (decoding) -> output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of standard SDKs and environment variables; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves configuration via environment variables. It uses Azure SDKs for event reception and schema decoding, which are standard and well-documented. No malicious functions, network calls, or data exfiltration are present. The code performs expected operations: listening to an event hub, decoding messages, and printing output. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident. Proper resource cleanup is implemented in the main() function.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate example of Azure Event Hub event processing with schema validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in the provided code. It is safe based on the analysis.",
