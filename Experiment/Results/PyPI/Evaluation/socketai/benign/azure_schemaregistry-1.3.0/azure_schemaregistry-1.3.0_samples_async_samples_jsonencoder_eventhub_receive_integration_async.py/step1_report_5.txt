{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to asynchronously receive events from an Azure Event Hub, decode the event payloads using Azure Schema Registry with JSON schemas, and print the decoded content.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for connection strings, schema registry namespace, and other configuration; event.body for incoming event data.",
  "sinks": "Decoded event content printed to the console; bytes payload printed to the console.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> EventHubConsumerClient.receive() -> on_event() function -> json_schema_encoder.decode() -> print statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard SDKs and proper async context management. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The script employs Azure SDKs for event consumption and schema decoding in an expected manner, with secure credential management via DefaultAzureCredential. It processes incoming events and prints their contents without modifying or transmitting data elsewhere. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code is standard and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Azure event data receiver and decoder. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It operates as expected for an Azure SDK-based event processing script.",
