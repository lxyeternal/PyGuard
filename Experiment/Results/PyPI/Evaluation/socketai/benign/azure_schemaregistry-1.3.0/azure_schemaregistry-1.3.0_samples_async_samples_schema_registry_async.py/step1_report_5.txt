{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous interaction with Azure Schema Registry for schema registration and retrieval operations, intended for managing JSON schemas in a cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP' are read for configuration. No other external data inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output (print statements), but does not write to files, network, or external systems beyond Azure SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables into SDK client configuration; schema definitions are used for registration and retrieval; printed outputs display retrieved schemas and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. The code includes typical schema management operations. No hardcoded secrets other than schema URLs, which are expected. No obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily interacts with Azure SDK components for schema management using credentials sourced from environment variables. It performs standard registration and retrieval operations for schemas, with no indications of malicious behavior. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice. No data exfiltration, network anomalies, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, with proper async usage, and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample for Azure Schema Registry management. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. No security risks are identified beyond standard schema management operations. Overall, the script is safe and intended for authorized schema handling in cloud environments.",
