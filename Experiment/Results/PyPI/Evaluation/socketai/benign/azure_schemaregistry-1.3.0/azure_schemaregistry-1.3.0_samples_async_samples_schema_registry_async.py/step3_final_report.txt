{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates asynchronous registration and retrieval of schemas using Azure Schema Registry SDK with environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and group; static JSON schema definitions within code.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK network calls; print statements outputting schema details.",
  "flows": "Schema registration and retrieval functions invoke SDK methods; outputs schema info via logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate Azure schema registry operations with static schemas and environment-based credentials. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. Logs could expose schema details if schemas contain sensitive info, but this is typical in schema management scripts. No obfuscation or malicious activity identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of Azure schema registry interaction. No signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily reflecting minimal info leakage potential. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
