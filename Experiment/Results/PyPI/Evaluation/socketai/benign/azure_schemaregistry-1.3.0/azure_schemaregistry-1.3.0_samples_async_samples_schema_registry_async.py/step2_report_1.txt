  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard schema registry management with environment variables and static schemas.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls to Azure SDK; logs schema info.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets; use of environment variables is standard.\n- **Analysis:** All operations are legitimate Azure SDK interactions; no malicious code or backdoors. The only concern is potential leakage of schema info via logs if schemas contain sensitive data, but this is typical in schema management.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; minimal security risk. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (due to potential info leakage).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard Azure SDK usage, no suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical schema management)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: environment variables, static schemas, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard schema registry operations, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports, straightforward Azure SDK interactions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** The overall risk is very low, mostly due to potential info leakage if schemas contain sensitive info, but this is a normal concern in schema management, not malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal risk, primarily informational leakage potential, not malicious activity)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, legitimate Azure SDK example with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Keep the overall risk at approximately 0.1, acknowledging minimal exposure risk but no malicious activity.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is benign and aligns with best practices for schema registry management.",
