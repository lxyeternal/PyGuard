{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates asynchronously interacting with Azure Schema Registry for schema registration and retrieval, including registering schemas, fetching schemas by ID or version, and obtaining schema IDs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP' used to supply namespace and group name; schema definitions defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output schema details and IDs; no data is sent to external or untrusted sources; no user input is processed; no network transmission of sensitive data observed within the code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Schema registry client methods (register_schema, get_schema, get_schema_properties) → print outputs; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials are absent; environment variables are used but are standard practice; no obfuscated or malicious code structures detected; no backdoors, hidden code, or suspicious external communications; schema definitions are static and standard JSON schemas.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard schema registry operations using Azure SDK with asynchronous programming; no suspicious code or malicious behavior detected; environment variables are used for configuration, which is normal; all data handling appears to be for schema management. No malicious activities, backdoors, or malware indications are present. The code does not process untrusted user input nor perform insecure operations. The only external dependencies are Azure SDKs and environment variables, which are legitimate in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure Schema Registry usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of environment variables and standard SDK functions poses no immediate security threat. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured with no malicious intent.",
