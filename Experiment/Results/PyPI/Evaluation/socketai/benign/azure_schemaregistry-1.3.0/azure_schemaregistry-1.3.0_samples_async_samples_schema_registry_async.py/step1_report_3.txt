  "purpose": "This script demonstrates asynchronous interaction with Azure Schema Registry for registering and retrieving schemas.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP; User-defined constants for schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK methods that send schema data to Azure services; print statements for logging schema details.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Schema registry client initialization -> Schema registration/retrieval functions -> Output via print statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic code execution; schema definitions are static JSON schemas, no suspicious modifications; no suspicious network activity observed from the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from environment variables, uses Azure SDKs to register and retrieve schemas asynchronously, and logs relevant information via print statements. No sensitive data like credentials is hardcoded; credentials are obtained through Azure's DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard authentication mechanism. Schema data is static JSON and is used for schema registration, which is typical. The code does not contain any suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network calls, or backdoors. All operations appear to be legitimate interactions with Azure Schema Registry. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of using Azure SDKs for schema management. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and aligns with typical usage patterns. The overall maliciousness score is very low.",
