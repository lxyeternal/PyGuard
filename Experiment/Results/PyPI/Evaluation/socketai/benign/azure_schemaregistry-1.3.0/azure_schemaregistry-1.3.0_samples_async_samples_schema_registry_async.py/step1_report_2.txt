{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates asynchronous interaction with Azure Schema Registry for registering and retrieving JSON schemas, mainly for schema management purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and group name, and predefined JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no data is written to network destinations other than Azure SDK calls which are standard for Azure services.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as sources for configuration; schema registration and retrieval functions involve passing schema definitions and IDs, primarily within Azure SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors; no suspicious code behaviors. Use of environment variables is standard. No obfuscated or misleading code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables to configure connection details, follows standard async patterns, and employs Azure SDKs for schema operations. No suspicious data handling, no code injection points, and no unusual logic or obfuscated code present. It appears to be a typical Azure SDK usage for schema management. The JSON schemas are hardcoded but are benign and typical in schema management contexts. No malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of Azure Schema Registry interactions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs schema registration and retrieval operations securely, utilizing environment variables for configuration. Overall, the code is benign with a low malware score.",
