{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates encoding and decoding JSON schema content asynchronously using Azure's Schema Registry and Event Hub SDKs, including authentication with Azure Active Directory.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for Azure credentials and schema registry info, JSON schema definition, data passed to encoder.encode()",
  "sinks": "Encoder's encode and decode methods, EventData creation and handling",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> JSON schema -> encode() -> EventData from message content -> decode() -> decoded output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard SDK usage; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates with Azure AD using environment variables, encodes a JSON message, wraps it in EventData, and then decodes it. All operations utilize Azure SDK functions as intended. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are detected. The data flow is straightforward and aligns with typical messaging pattern practices. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code does not perform any network connections outside SDK calls, nor does it contain hidden backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard example of encoding and decoding JSON schema data using Azure's SDKs with proper authentication. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe to use within its intended purpose.",
