{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates encoding and decoding of message content using Azure Schema Registry with asynchronous SDKs, including credential management via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and schema information; input data for encoding.",
  "sinks": "EventData object containing encoded content; message content used for decoding.",
  "flows": "Credentials and schema info are read from environment variables, used to instantiate clients; data is encoded into message content, wrapped in EventData, then decoded back to original content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; standard SDK usage; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages secrets via environment variables, uses Azure SDKs as intended, and performs straightforward encoding/decoding operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The data flow is standard, with no suspicious network activity or code injection. The environment variables are used appropriately, and the logic is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK sample demonstrating schema registry message encoding and decoding. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting standard secret management practices.",
