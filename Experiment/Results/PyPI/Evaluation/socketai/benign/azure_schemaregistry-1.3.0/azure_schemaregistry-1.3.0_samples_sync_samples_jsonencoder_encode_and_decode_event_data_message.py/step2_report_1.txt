  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of the code's intent; environment variables for credentials and static JSON schema.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states no anomalies, no suspicious code, and that the code is a standard Azure SDK example. It notes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The security risk is low, given the standard use of environment variables.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential data leakage via printed encoded content.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code; standard SDK usage; no suspicious network activity. The concern about printing encoded content is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign; printing sensitive data is a concern but not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard description; static schema in code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, no obfuscation. Uses SDKs properly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description; credentials via environment variables.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard SDK use; no backdoors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; mention of network calls and environment variables.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; legitimate schema registration and encoding. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no data exfiltration, no payload execution, no suspicious network activity beyond SDK calls, and no obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The reported 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting a low security risk mainly due to the use of environment variables for credentials and potential data leakage if printed. However, these are common in sample code and not indicative of a real vulnerability.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- Given the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, I would assign **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, and **securityRisk=0.2** as appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code as a benign sample demonstrating Azure SDK usage.",
