  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured sample with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to credential handling and potential data leakage via prints, which are typical in sample code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0."
