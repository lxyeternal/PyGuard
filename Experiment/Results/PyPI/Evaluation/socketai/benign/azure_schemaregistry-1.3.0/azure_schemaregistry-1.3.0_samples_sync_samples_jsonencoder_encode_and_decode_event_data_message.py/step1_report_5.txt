  "purpose": "This script demonstrates schema registration, encoding, and decoding of JSON data for Azure Event Hub messaging using Azure Schema Registry and Azure Identity for authentication.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and namespace, input JSON schema, and hardcoded data dictionaries for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoded EventData objects potentially sent to Event Hub, printing encoded/decoded data, and network calls to Azure services for schema registration and retrieval.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and JSON schema → schema registration and encoding functions → Azure Schema Registry and Event Hub SDK network calls for schema registration, encoding, decoding, and schema retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code properly handles secrets via environment variables, and no hardcoded credentials are present. No obfuscated or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate operations for schema management and message encoding/decoding using Azure SDKs. Credentials are securely fetched from environment variables, and network operations involve schema registration and retrieval, which are expected in such applications. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. No suspicious or backdoor code, no use of dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The code adheres to best practices for Azure SDK usage and security, with proper separation of concerns and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Azure Event Hub messaging with schema management, showing no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It securely manages credentials, interacts with Azure services as expected, and performs legitimate data encoding/decoding. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
