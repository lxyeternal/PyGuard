  "purpose": "Demonstrates registering a schema with Azure Schema Registry, encoding data into EventData objects, and decoding them back, using Azure SDKs and environment-based credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials, static JSON schema in code, input data dictionaries for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Printed encoded content and content types, decoding results.",
  "flows": "Credentials read from environment variables -> schema registration -> encoding data with schema ID -> printing encoded data -> decoding encoded data back to original content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets (beyond environment variables), obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Printing encoded content could leak data but is typical in sample code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDKs for schema registration, encoding, and decoding. Credentials are managed via environment variables, which is standard but should be handled securely. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no malicious payloads. The schema is static and benign. The print statements do not indicate malicious intent but could leak sensitive data if logs are exposed. Overall, the code is a straightforward, benign example demonstrating Azure schema registry usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured sample with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to credential handling and potential data leakage via prints, which are typical in sample code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
