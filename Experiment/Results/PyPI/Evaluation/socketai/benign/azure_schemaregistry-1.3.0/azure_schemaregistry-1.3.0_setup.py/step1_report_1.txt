{
  "purpose": "The script is used for setting up and configuring a Python package for distribution, including extracting version info, reading documentation files, and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py', reads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files from disk, and imports setup-related modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' to process and install package data; no direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from a file (source) and passes it to setup() (sink). Reads documentation files (source) for long description. No external data flows or untrusted inputs into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. All file paths and operations appear standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version info from a file, reading documentation files, and calling setuptools.setup with metadata and dependencies. It handles file I/O safely and uses standard practices. No suspicious code, no network activity, no dynamic execution or obfuscation. All operations are consistent with package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads version info and documentation files, and executes setup accordingly. No malicious or suspicious actions detected.",
