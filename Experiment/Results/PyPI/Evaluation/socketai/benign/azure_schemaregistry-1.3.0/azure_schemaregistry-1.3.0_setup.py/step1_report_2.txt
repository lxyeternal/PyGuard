  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library, specifically for the Azure Schema Registry client.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files, and the initial imports.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that execute untrusted data or perform insecure actions. No network or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from a file, then uses this data in the setup configuration; reads documentation files for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file I/O operations to gather package metadata and configure package setup. It extracts version info with regex, reads documentation files, and defines dependencies and metadata. All operations follow standard Python packaging practices. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
