{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the azure-schemaregistry Python library, including version extraction and metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "None directly involving untrusted data; no network or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "Reading version file and README/CHANGELOG files during setup; no external data flow beyond file reads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Standard setup procedures used.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: imports modules, defines package metadata, reads version info from a file, reads documentation files, and calls setup() with configuration. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns. The version extraction uses regex to parse a local file, which is a common pattern. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard setup procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
