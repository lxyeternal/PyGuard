{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure and setup a Python package distribution for the 'azure-schemaregistry' library, including version extraction, package discovery, and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files: '_version.py' for version info, 'README.md', and 'CHANGELOG.md' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "The script calls the 'setup()' function from setuptools, which uses the collected data to prepare a package distribution; no external data sinks or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('_version.py', README, CHANGELOG) into variables; these variables are then passed into 'setup()' to configure the package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network connections, cryptography, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, reading version info from a file with regex, reading documentation files, defining package metadata, and calling 'setup()'. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic. All activities align with typical package configuration scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply reads files and configures package metadata for distribution.",
