{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to authenticate with Azure Schema Registry, register schemas, and retrieve schemas by ID or version for managing JSON schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP, and the JSON schema definitions embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for logging schema operations; no apparent sinks for untrusted data outside logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at start, schemas are registered and retrieved via the SchemaRegistryClient methods, with data flow primarily for schema management operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code uses environment variables for sensitive info, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs schema registration and retrieval with clear, documented steps. It reads configuration from environment variables, which are necessary for flexible deployment, and logs operations via print statements. All data handling appears to be within the scope of schema management without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code does not manipulate untrusted data beyond schema registration and retrieval, which are legitimate operations for schema management. No malware signatures or obfuscated code are detected. The structure and flow are typical for Azure SDK usage, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sample for managing JSON schemas with Azure Schema Registry. It performs legitimate schema registration and retrieval without any malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware or malicious activity found.",
