{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates how to authenticate and interact with Azure Schema Registry service, including registering schemas and retrieving them by various identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for namespace and group name; imports modules; uses json data; accesses Azure credentials and schema registry client methods.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data and schema information via print statements; calls Azure SDK methods.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK client initialization -> schema registration and retrieval functions -> print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; schema definitions are static JSON objects; no dynamic or insecure operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely utilizes environment variables for sensitive configuration; uses Azure SDK with DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard secure credential provider; no user input is directly used; no code injection, data leakage, or network connections beyond SDK calls are present; schema JSON data is static and well-formed; all operations are standard SDK interactions for schema management; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate schema registry operations with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It handles data securely, does not include hardcoded secrets, and uses proper SDK authentication mechanisms.",
