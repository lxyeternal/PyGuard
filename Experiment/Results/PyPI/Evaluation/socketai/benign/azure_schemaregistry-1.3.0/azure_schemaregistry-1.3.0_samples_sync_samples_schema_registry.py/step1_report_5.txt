{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates interacting with Azure Schema Registry for schema registration and retrieval, primarily for managing JSON schemas.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP), JSON schema definitions, user input via environment variables",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK methods that communicate with Azure services (register_schema, get_schema, get_schema_properties)",
  "flows": "Environment variables → JSON schemas and schema definitions → SDK methods for registration and retrieval",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials other than environment variables; no suspicious code behavior. Uses standard SDK calls; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script securely uses environment variables to obtain configuration data and leverages Azure SDK's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication, which is a recommended and safe practice. JSON schemas are statically defined within the code and are registered and retrieved via SDK methods. No untrusted data sources, malicious data handling, or suspicious network communications are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of schema registry interactions with proper use of credentials and SDKs. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating schema management in Azure. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily interacts with Azure services using standard SDK practices and environment variables for configuration.",
