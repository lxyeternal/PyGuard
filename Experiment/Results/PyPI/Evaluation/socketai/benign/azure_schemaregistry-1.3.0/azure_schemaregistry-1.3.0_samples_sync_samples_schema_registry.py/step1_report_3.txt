  "purpose": "This script demonstrates usage of Azure's SchemaRegistryClient for registering and retrieving JSON schemas in an Azure environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP), local JSON schema definitions, user input (via environment variables).",
  "sinks": "Print statements for logging, calls to Azure SDK methods that may transmit data over the network.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to configure client connection; schema definitions are registered and retrieved via SDK calls; data flows from environment and code into Azure services via SDK methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic; usage of environment variables is standard; no suspicious network activity or backdoors; no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up environment variables, uses Azure SDK to manage schemas in Azure Schema Registry, and performs typical schema registration and retrieval operations. The data appears to flow from local schema definitions and environment variables to Azure services, with logging via print statements. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. The code relies on Azure's SDK for cloud interactions, which is standard for such operations. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are observed. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or data exfiltration beyond standard SDK use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Azure Schema Registry client operations for managing JSON schemas. It performs expected tasks without suspicious or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware, malicious data flow, or security risks within this code fragment.",
