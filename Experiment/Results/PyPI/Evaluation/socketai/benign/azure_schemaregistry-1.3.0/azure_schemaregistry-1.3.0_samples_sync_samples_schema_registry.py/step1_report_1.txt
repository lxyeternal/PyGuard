  "purpose": "This script demonstrates authenticating and interacting with Azure Schema Registry to register and retrieve JSON schemas.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_JSON_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP'; JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Client method calls to register and retrieve schemas, printing outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure the client, schemas are registered and retrieved via client methods, and results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; schema definitions are static JSON objects; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDK components and environment variables for configuration. It registers schemas and retrieves them by ID and version, with no user input or untrusted data processed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present. The only potential concern is the printing of schema details, but that is for demonstration purposes and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward sample demonstrating Azure Schema Registry API usage with no malicious or suspicious activity. It is secure in its current form and appears to serve an educational or development purpose.",
