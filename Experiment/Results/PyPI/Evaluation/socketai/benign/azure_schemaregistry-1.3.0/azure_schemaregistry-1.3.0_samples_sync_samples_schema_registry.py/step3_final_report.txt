  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of Azure Schema Registry SDK for registering and retrieving schemas, primarily for educational or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, static JSON schema definitions, SDK method calls for schema registration and retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting schema details and properties; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration data; SDK methods process schemas; outputs are printed for demonstration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables securely for configuration, employs standard SDK practices, and handles static JSON schemas without dynamic code execution. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The print statements are typical for sample code and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard example of Azure Schema Registry usage, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and the code is appropriate for demonstration purposes.",
