{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous management of Azure Schema Registry schemas, including registration, retrieval by ID and version, and schema updates, using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and group, static JSON schema definitions, and SDK method calls for schema registration and retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK API calls that send schema data to Azure services; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Schema JSON definitions are serialized and sent via SDK methods; environment variables provide configuration data; no untrusted input flows into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Schema definitions are static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Azure SDK sample for schema registry management, performing schema registration, retrieval, and updates. It uses environment variables for configuration, static JSON schemas, and async SDK calls. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign example of Azure Schema Registry usage. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with standard cloud SDK interactions.",
