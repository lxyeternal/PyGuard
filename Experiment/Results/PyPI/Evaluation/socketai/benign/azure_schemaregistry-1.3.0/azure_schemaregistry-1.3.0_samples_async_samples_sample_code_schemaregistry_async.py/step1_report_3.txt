  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous interaction with Azure Schema Registry for schema registration, retrieval by ID, version, and updating schemas, mainly for schema management and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP'; JSON schema definitions within functions.",
  "sinks": "Schema registration and retrieval functions; printing schema definitions and properties.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> JSON schema definitions -> schema registry client methods (register, get schema) -> print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration; schema JSON data appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no signs of malicious backdoors or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs schema registration and retrieval using Azure SDK functions, leveraging environment variables for configuration. It uses standard async patterns, JSON schemas, and SDK calls. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. No suspicious code flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code detected. The code primarily interacts with Azure services, and all data processing appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample for managing schemas with Azure Schema Registry. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in the provided code. It operates within expected parameters for schema management and does not contain malicious payloads.",
