{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates asynchronous interactions with Azure Schema Registry, including schema registration, retrieval by ID and version, and updating schemas, primarily for managing schema lifecycle within a cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP'; input data via JSON schemas within the code; no external untrusted data sources are explicitly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "API calls to 'register_schema', 'get_schema', 'get_schema_by_version', and 'get_schema_properties' which interact with Azure's cloud services; these are normal API interactions rather than malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "The code creates a client with credentials, registers schemas, retrieves schemas by ID and version, and updates schemas, following standard API flow for schema management. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (other than environment variable names), or malicious code behavior. Schema JSON definitions are hardcoded but are standard for schema management.",
  "analysis": "The script uses environment variables for configuration, which is typical for cloud-based applications. It interacts with Azure SDKs to register and retrieve schemas asynchronously. There are no indications of data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious API calls. The code’s structure and content align with standard schema registry management, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. It properly manages credentials via Azure SDK best practices. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing schemas in Azure Schema Registry using async Python SDKs. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script appears legitimate and safe, with no signs of sabotage or exploitation.",
