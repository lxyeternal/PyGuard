{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronously interacting with Azure Schema Registry to register, retrieve, and update schemas using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP), os.environ access for configuration values, JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Calls to schema_registry_client methods (register_schema, get_schema, get_schema_by_version, get_schema_id) which send data to Azure services; print statements displaying schema definitions and properties.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → JSON schema definitions → register_schema/get_schema/get_schema_by_version/get_schema_id calls → Data sent over network to Azure Schema Registry, responses received and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; use of environment variables for sensitive info; schema definitions are static within the code; no suspicious or malicious code snippets; no code injection or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses environment variables for configuration, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It employs Azure SDK's async methods appropriately, with no indications of malicious activities. Data flows from environment variables and in-code JSON schemas to Azure services, with no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. Print statements only display schema details; no sensitive information is leaked. The overall structure is standard for schema management operations. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of Azure Schema Registry client interactions with no malicious intent or malicious code present. It adheres to best practices by avoiding hardcoded secrets and not executing any suspicious or obfuscated code.",
