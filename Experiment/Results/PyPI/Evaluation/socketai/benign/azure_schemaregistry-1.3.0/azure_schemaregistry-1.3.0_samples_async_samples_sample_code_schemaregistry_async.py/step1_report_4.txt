{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous interaction with Azure Schema Registry, including schema registration, retrieval by ID and version, and updating schemas.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE', 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP'; JSON schema definitions; user input is indirectly involved via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Printing schema definitions and properties to standard output; calling external Azure services via SDK methods.",
  "flows": "Schema JSON definitions are created in code, registered, then retrieved by ID or version; schema properties and definitions are printed, with no untrusted data flowing into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with Azure Schema Registry using provided SDKs, with proper asynchronous handling. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious network activity, or tampering. The JSON schema definitions are hardcoded but benign, used for schema management. No untrusted data sources or unsafe operations are present. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Azure Schema Registry operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages schemas and interacts with Azure services without any malicious or harmful actions.",
