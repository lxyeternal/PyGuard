{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates how to interact with Azure Schema Registry, including creating a client, registering schemas, retrieving schemas by ID or version, and updating schemas.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and group name, JSON schema definitions, and user-provided schema data.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting schema definitions and properties, which could potentially leak schema details, but not sensitive secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → JSON schema definitions → schema registry client methods → print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code uses environment variables for sensitive data. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The schema data is static and predefined, with no dynamic or untrusted input handling beyond environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses environment variables for configuration and Azure SDK credentials. It employs standard SDK methods to register and retrieve schemas, with no apparent data leaks or malicious code. The only sensitive data potentially involved are environment variables, which are a standard and recommended practice. The print statements output schema information, which might reveal schema structures but not sensitive secrets. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code functions as intended for schema management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate example of using Azure SDK for schema registry operations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data and credentials appropriately, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. It is safe for use in a supply chain context.",
