  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to interact with Azure Schema Registry for registering and retrieving schemas, including creating a client with Azure credentials and managing schema versions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP); hardcoded schema JSON data",
  "sinks": "Printing schema definitions and properties to stdout",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as input sources; schema data is processed and printed; no data is sent over network or written to files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. Schema JSON data is hardcoded, but this is typical for sample code, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, creates a client for Azure Schema Registry using environment variables and DefaultAzureCredential, and performs schema registration and retrieval. It handles schema versions and updates schemas, with no indications of malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code. It primarily reads environment variables, manages schemas, and prints output. No network connections outside Azure services are initiated directly, and no sensitive information is hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sample for using Azure Schema Registry SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses environment variables for configuration and prints schema details, which is typical for illustrative or testing purposes. No malicious behaviors or security concerns are evident.",
