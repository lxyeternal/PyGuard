{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to authenticate, register, retrieve, and update schemas in Azure Schema Registry using the azure SDK, primarily for schema management tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for namespace and group names; reads JSON schema definitions directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output schema definitions and properties; no data is sent over the network outside Azure SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> JSON schema definitions -> Azure SchemaRegistryClient methods (register/get schema) -> print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The schema JSON is hardcoded but appears to be legitimate schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script uses environment variables to configure access credentials and schema registry details, which is standard. Schema definitions are hardcoded but do not contain sensitive data. The code interacts exclusively with Azure SDK functions, performing schema registration and retrieval without any suspicious or malicious logic. No network connections outside Azure services are attempted, and no data leakage or backdoors are present. The code performs expected schema management operations in a secure manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical schema registry client example with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It relies on environment variables and SDK functions for its operation. There are no indicators of sabotage, malware, or privacy violations.",
