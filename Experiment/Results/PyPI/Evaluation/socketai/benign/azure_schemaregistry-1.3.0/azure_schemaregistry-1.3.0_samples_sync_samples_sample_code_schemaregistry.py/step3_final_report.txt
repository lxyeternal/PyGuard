  "purpose": "Demonstrates Azure SchemaRegistryClient operations such as registering, retrieving, and updating schemas using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and group; hardcoded schema JSON objects within functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting schema definitions and properties.",
  "flows": "Schema registration and retrieval functions call SDK methods; print statements output schema details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward sample for Azure Schema Registry SDK usage, with schema definitions hardcoded for demonstration. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard. No network connections outside SDK calls are present, and no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The print statements reveal schema details but do not leak sensitive information. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious payloads or activities. The security risk score is very low (0.1), primarily due to schema info exposure in logs, which is typical for sample code. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with best practices for such samples.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured example of Azure Schema Registry interactions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
