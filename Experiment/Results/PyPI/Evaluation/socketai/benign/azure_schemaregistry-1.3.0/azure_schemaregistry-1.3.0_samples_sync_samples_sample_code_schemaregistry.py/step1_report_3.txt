{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates interacting with Azure Schema Registry to register, retrieve, and update schemas, primarily for managing data schemas in a cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_AVRO_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SCHEMAREGISTRY_GROUP'. JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Azure SchemaRegistryClient methods: register_schema, get_schema, get_schema_by_version, get_schema_id, which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration data; JSON schemas are serialized and sent to Azure services via API calls; schema retrievals occur via API calls using schema IDs or versions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded secrets (besides schema details), or obfuscated code are present. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard, but no hardcoded credentials are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for configuration, adhering to best practices. It performs schema registration and retrieval via Azure SDK, with no evident malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. All network interactions are with legitimate Azure services, and data flows are predictable for schema management. No anomalies or malware-like behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate example of schema registry operations, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It handles schema management securely and transparently, assuming the environment variables are set properly and the Azure SDK functions as intended.",
