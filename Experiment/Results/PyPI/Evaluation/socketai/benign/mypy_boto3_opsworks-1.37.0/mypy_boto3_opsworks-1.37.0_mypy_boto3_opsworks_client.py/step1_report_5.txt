  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS OpsWorks service, providing methods to interact with AWS resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements, method definitions with kwargs unpacking, type annotations, and property methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe method parameters (kwargs) which could include untrusted input; methods that generate URLs or perform actions like assigning, deleting, or updating resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) flow into various client methods that invoke AWS API actions, such as create, delete, update, or describe resources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Unpack' with extensive type definitions, but no explicit code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No evident malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage appears consistent with AWS SDK interface design.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of method signatures, type annotations, and property definitions forming a client interface to AWS OpsWorks. All methods accept kwargs unpacked from predefined type definitions, corresponding to API parameters. No explicit data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. The import of external AWS SDK modules and type hints aligns with standard SDK usage. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or unintended data leakage. The structure and content follow typical SDK stub patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code functions as a type-annotated interface for AWS OpsWorks SDK client, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate stub definition for type safety and convenience in AWS SDK usage.",
