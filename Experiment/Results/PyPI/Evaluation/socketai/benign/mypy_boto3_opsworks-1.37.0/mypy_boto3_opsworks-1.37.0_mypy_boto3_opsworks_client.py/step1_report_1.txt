{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 OpsWorks service, providing typed interfaces for API operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions; property and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS API operations via boto3, mainly passing parameters unpacked from type defs; no untrusted data handling within the code.",
  "flows": "Method parameters are unpacked from type definitions and passed directly to boto3 client methods, with no data processing or storage; no suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden code; code appears to be standard type annotations and method stubs for a boto3 client.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly typed wrapper for the boto3 OpsWorks client, including property accessors, method signatures with type annotations, and overloads for waiters. All method implementations appear to be straightforward wrappers calling AWS APIs with parameters unpacked from pre-defined types. There are no indications of code injection, malicious logic, or secret leaks. The code is well-structured and intended solely for type safety and API interface definitions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a well-structured, type-annotated client interface for AWS OpsWorks. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions purely as a typed wrapper around boto3 operations, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
