  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS OpsWorks SDK, serving as a type-safe interface for API calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions, URL generation functions, and API request payloads.",
  "sinks": "API call parameters, URL generation functions, and resource identifiers; no untrusted data processing beyond parameter passing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into API methods via kwargs, which are passed directly to AWS SDK calls; generate_presigned_url constructs URLs with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard SDK interface structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, type-annotated wrapper for the boto3 OpsWorks client, primarily consisting of method signatures and type definitions. It does not perform any data processing, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden logic. The generate_presigned_url method is a standard AWS feature for URL creation, not malicious. The use of kwargs allows for flexible parameter passing but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is to provide static type safety and API interface, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK interface for AWS OpsWorks with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects potential misuse if untrusted data is passed into API calls, but the code itself is secure and purely for type safety.",
