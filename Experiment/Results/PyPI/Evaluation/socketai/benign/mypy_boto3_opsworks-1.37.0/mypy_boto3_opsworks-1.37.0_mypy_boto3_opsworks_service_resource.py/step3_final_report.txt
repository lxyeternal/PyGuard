  "purpose": "Type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS OpsWorks SDK, intended for static type checking and resource management.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external output, or data processing; methods are wrappers for AWS API calls with parameters from method arguments.",
  "flows": "Method calls to AWS APIs with no complex data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious logic, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and method signatures with type annotations, designed for static SDK resource representation. It employs conditional imports for compatibility but does not include executable logic, data leaks, or network operations. No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is standard for boto3 stubs, serving as a static interface for AWS OpsWorks resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK stub for AWS OpsWorks resources, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It is safe for supply chain purposes, and the scores should reflect minimal risk.",
