{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and resource classes for AWS OpsWorks service, providing a structured interface for managing stacks and layers via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, boto3, and local modules; class attribute definitions; method parameters and returns.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations (though mostly stubs) that could potentially invoke AWS APIs; no direct data leaks or malicious commands observed.",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions and method signatures suggest data flow from user input through method calls to AWS API endpoints, but no actual execution logic or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Code primarily consists of class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures with no executable code, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type-annotated interface layer for AWS OpsWorks resources, generated or designed for static type checking and resource management. It contains class definitions, method signatures, and type imports, with no executable logic or data manipulation. The structure is consistent with SDK wrapper code, and no suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable, well-structured SDK interface with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It solely defines resource classes and method signatures for AWS resource management, posing no security risk.",
