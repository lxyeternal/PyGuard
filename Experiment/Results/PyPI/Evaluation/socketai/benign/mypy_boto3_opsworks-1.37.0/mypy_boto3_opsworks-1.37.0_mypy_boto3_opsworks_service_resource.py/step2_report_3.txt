  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is purely for type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS OpsWorks, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or complex data flows; methods are wrappers for AWS API calls with no dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Uses standard Python practices, conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard resource classes with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, given it's a type stub, but perhaps slightly above zero due to the nature of code that interfaces with external systems).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the structured interface for AWS resources.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- Uses standard practices, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.05 (very low).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on type annotations and resource classes, no executable logic.\n- No untrusted data, no network or file operations.\n- Well-structured, standard SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: type annotations, resource classes, no executable code.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also a static interface layer, no data processing or external effects.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that is purely for type annotations and resource class definitions for AWS SDK (boto3), with no executable logic, no data processing, no network activity, and no external data sources.\n- **Malicious indicators:** None detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially negligible; these are SDK stub definitions meant for static type checking.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (type stubs and resource class definitions), the risk is extremely low. Assigning a risk score of **0.0** or **0.1** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (minimum, as no security concern exists)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report appears to be a benign, standard SDK stub code for AWS OpsWorks resources, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores should reflect this low risk profile.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If any of these classes or methods were dynamically executing code, handling untrusted input, or containing suspicious patterns, the scores would need to be adjusted accordingly. But based on the provided descriptions, no such issues are present.",
