  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and resource classes for AWS OpsWorks, no external or untrusted data sources.  \n- Flows & Sinks: No data flow or output operations, only class definitions.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Standard, well-documented resource classes with minimal security risk.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: Given the absence of any malicious indicators, the minimal risk score of 0.1 seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, providing type annotations and resource classes.  \n- Flows & Sinks: No data leaks or external data handling.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, standard stub code for AWS resources.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: Slightly higher security risk (0.05) due to the nature of the code being a stub, but still negligible. The score of 0.05 is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and resource classes for boto3 AWS OpsWorks.  \n- Flows & Sinks: No untrusted data handling, no external communication.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Standard resource definitions, no malicious behavior.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: Zero or very close to zero is appropriate here.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and resource classes, purely declarative.  \n- Flows & Sinks: No actual logic, no data leaks.  \n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or backdoors.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate SDK stub code, no malicious intent.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: Again, very low or zero is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and resource classes, no executable logic.  \n- Flows & Sinks: No actual execution, just class signatures.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Standard SDK interface code, no malicious activity.  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: Zero or negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The malware score should be **0** across the board.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques detected. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code is purely declarative, resource class definitions, with no runtime logic or data handling. The minimal security risk is well represented by a score of **0.0 to 0.1**.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis that the code is a standard, safe, and well-documented set of resource classes for AWS SDK usage, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
