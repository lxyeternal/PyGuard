  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n- No dynamic behavior, input/output, or complex logic is present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current year 2024.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code **does** contain the `__version__` assignment, matching all reports.\n- There are no hidden or obfuscated parts; the code is straightforward.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The anomaly (future year 2025) is not inherently malicious but could suggest placeholder text or a typo.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No significant flaws are apparent in the reports’ reasoning.\n- The consistent conclusion across all reports that this is benign and standard is accurate.\n- The only minor point is the future date, which is correctly identified as potentially an inconsistency but not malicious.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no dynamic or untrusted input, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The only concern might be the future date, but this alone does not elevate the security risk.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- They do not overstate or understate the risk; their conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is harmless and serves a typical purpose in Python packages. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior and the minimal nature of the code. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The current scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
