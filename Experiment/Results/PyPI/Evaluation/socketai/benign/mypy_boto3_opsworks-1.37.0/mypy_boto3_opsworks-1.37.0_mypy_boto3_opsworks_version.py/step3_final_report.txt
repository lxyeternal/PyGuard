  "purpose": "Define the package version as a string for version control.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable with a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment is isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year 2025, which may be a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or complex logic. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The only anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future and likely a placeholder. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.",
