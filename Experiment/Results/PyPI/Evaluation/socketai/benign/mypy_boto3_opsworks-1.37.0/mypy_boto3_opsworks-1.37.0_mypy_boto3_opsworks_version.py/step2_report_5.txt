  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic involved. The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current year 2024. This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5, and given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are cautious and based on the actual code content. No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk Score**: 0 (no security issues)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with a minor anomaly in the future year. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Recommendation**: No changes needed. The scores and analysis are appropriate given the code snippet.",
