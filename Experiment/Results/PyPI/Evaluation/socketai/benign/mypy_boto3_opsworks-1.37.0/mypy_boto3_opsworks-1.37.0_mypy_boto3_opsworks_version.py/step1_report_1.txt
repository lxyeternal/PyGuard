  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The string assignment '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code is only setting a version string.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink beyond simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is a future date relative to the current year 2024. This could indicate placeholder text or an inconsistency, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to '__version__', a common practice in Python modules. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year 2025, which might be a placeholder or typo. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with a possible date inconsistency. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
