  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their findings, scores, and implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current year 2024. This is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n**1. Code verification:**\n- The code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or data flow.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n**2. Anomalies:**\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025.\n- This is not inherently malicious but could suggest placeholder text or an oversight.\n\n**3. Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n**4. Potential issues:**\n- No issues are present that would warrant a higher malware or security risk score.\n- The only concern is the future date, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk scores:** Since the code is trivial and standard, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- **Future date anomaly:** While not a security issue, it could be flagged as a documentation or placeholder inconsistency, but it doesn't affect security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (benign code, no vulnerabilities)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
