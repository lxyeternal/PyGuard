  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing information",
  "flows": "Command line arguments -> print_version or print_info -> sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious commands. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI entrypoint that responds to '--version' by printing the version, or otherwise prints package info. It uses standard library modules only, with no external network activity, data collection, or suspicious operations. No input/output flows indicate malicious data leakage or command injection. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI interface for displaying package info and version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its current implementation.",
