  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility.\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- It defines two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, both outputting static strings.\n- The `main()` function checks if `--version` is in `sys.argv`:\n  - If yes, calls `print_version()`.\n  - Otherwise, calls `print_info()`.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n**Common points across all reports:**\n- They agree that the code is simple, static, and only outputs package info or version.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- No external dependencies or network interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- High confidence (1.0) that the code is benign.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- This aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`.\n- Given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning is sound: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any issues with the code?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no security issues.\n\n- **Are the report's conclusions reasonable?**  \n  Yes. They correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n\n- **Any assumptions or potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The reports explicitly state no suspicious behavior, which is accurate.\n\n- **Are the scores justified?**  \n  Yes. Given the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for security risk, are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static, and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, safe CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details. All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0              |\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. It only outputs predefined static information, with no external interactions or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways remain vigilant for supply chain issues, but in this case, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
