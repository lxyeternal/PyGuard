  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) -> Decision (if '--version') -> Output (print_version or print_info) -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility. It reads command-line arguments and outputs static informational strings. No untrusted data is processed, and there are no suspicious behaviors or external network interactions. The functions are simple and only print predefined package info or version. The script is minimal, with no hidden or malicious code, and the control flow is predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely outputs static package information and version details, and does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data.",
