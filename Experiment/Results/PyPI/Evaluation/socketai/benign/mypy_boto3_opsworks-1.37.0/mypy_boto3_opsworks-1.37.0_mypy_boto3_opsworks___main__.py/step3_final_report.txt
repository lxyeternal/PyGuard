  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input argument '--version'",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "sys.argv check -> print_version or print_info -> sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports only sys, defines two functions for printing static info, and a main function that checks for '--version' argument to decide output. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is simple, static, and benign, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its safety, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic is clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
