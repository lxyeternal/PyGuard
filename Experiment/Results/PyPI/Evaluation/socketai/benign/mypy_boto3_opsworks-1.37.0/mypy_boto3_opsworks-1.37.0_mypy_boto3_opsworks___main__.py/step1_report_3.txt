{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface entry point that outputs package information or version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to sys.stdout; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv influences the output, primarily through the presence of '--version'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or behaviors. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output operations. It defines functions to print package info and version details. The main() function checks for '--version' in command-line arguments and conditionally outputs version info; otherwise, it outputs package info. The script runs main() if executed directly. There are no external data sources, no use of insecure practices, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version number. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be benign and safe for use.",
