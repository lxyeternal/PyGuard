  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv, then calls print_version() or print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script only provides package info and version details based on command-line input. It uses standard sys and sys.stdout functions. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs processed beyond argument checking, and no suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution. The functions are straightforward, with no complex logic or obfuscation. No signs of malicious activity or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version details. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and is safe for use. It appears to be a standard, benign script.",
