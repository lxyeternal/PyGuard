  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports only the standard library (`sys`).\n- It provides two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, which output static package info and version info, respectively.\n- The `main()` function checks for `--version` in `sys.argv` and calls the appropriate function.\n- The script runs `main()` if executed directly.\n- There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; the script only outputs static information.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe, with a confidence level of 1. They note the absence of malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or supply chain attack vector.\n- The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, the scores seem appropriate. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and safe.**",
