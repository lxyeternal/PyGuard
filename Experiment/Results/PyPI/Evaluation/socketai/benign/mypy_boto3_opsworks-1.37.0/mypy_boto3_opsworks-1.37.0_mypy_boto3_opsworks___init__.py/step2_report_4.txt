  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is an interface module for AWS OpsWorks, importing internal components and handling import errors with a fallback.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external input processing.\n- **Anomalies:** The fallback to `builtins.object` is a common pattern for optional dependencies; no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, well-structured, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1.0), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriately zero.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the fallback import as benign. No external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), still noting the fallback import as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 (small, due to the fallback pattern). This is acceptable; fallback import is common and not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern, standard import handling with fallback.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. This is consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected. The fallback import pattern is a benign compatibility measure.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of external data processing, network activity, or code execution, the overall security risk remains very low, close to zero.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malware activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 at most, primarily due to the fallback pattern, which is benign.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The fallback import pattern is a common practice and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to fallback pattern, but not a security concern)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or have additional reports.",
