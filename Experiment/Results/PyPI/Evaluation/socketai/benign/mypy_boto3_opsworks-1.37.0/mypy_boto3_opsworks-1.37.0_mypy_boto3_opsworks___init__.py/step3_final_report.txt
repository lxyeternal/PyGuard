{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for AWS OpsWorks, exporting clients, waiters, paginators, and resource classes for use in other code.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (.client, .paginator, .waiter, .service_resource) and the fallback assignment to builtins.object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports without data flow from untrusted sources; the fallback import assigns a benign placeholder.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback to 'builtins.object' for 'OpsWorksServiceResource' is slightly unusual but a common pattern for optional dependencies or type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, importing components and handling an ImportError fallback. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The fallback pattern is benign and standard for optional dependencies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the fallback pattern, which is benign but slightly unusual. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module for AWS OpsWorks with no malicious or security risks. The fallback import pattern is a common practice and not malicious. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
