  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS OpsWorks and related services, primarily for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations assigned directly as string literals; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of type alias definitions using Python's Literal type, which restricts variables to specific string values. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, and defines various literal types for AWS resource identifiers, waiter names, regions, etc. There is no dynamic or external data handling, no execution logic, and no code that interacts with system resources or network. The comments and structure indicate purpose for type safety and documentation. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining type annotations for AWS service literals. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. Its design is straightforward and aligns with standard type definition practices, posing no security risks.",
