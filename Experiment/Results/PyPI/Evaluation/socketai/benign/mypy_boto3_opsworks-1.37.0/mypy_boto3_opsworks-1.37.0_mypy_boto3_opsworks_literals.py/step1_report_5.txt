{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS service parameters and configurations to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code sources data primarily from static string literals defined within the code itself, including imported modules such as sys and typing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flow from sources to sinks. It is purely type definition.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement with the year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, indicating possible placeholder or misdated info but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The import of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' is standard for compatibility and pose no risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string literal type definitions intended for static type checking of AWS service parameters. It uses standard Python constructs and conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic execution, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The presence of future-dated copyright is unusual but not harmful. Overall, the code serves as a static, type-safe schema without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type literals for AWS service parameters, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its structure and content are consistent with safe type definition files. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a placeholder.",
