{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS and related service identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from sys.version_info and imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions. It defines several constant string literal types for use elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output based on external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, defining type literals with no dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that provides type aliases for various AWS service string literals. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is standard practice. The __all__ tuple specifies exported identifiers. The literal definitions are simple and static, listing string constants. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static definition of string literal types for AWS services. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe module intended for type annotations.",
