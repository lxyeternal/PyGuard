{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations for AWS OpsWorks service literals using Python's typing system, enabling type safety and validation for these string literal values.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; definitions of Literal types for various AWS-related constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines type aliases and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving user input or external untrusted sources; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is a straightforward static type definition module.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, then defines a large set of Literal type aliases for AWS OpsWorks and related resource constants. The definitions are purely static, intended for type checking, and do not include any data processing, I/O, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a standard type annotations module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static type annotations file defining constants for AWS resources and services. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It serves as a helper module for type safety in Python projects.",
