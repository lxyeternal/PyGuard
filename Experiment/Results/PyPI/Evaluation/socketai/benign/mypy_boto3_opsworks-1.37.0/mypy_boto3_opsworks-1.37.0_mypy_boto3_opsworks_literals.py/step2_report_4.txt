  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS OpsWorks, reads no external data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, no malicious behavior, purely static type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining constants for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic behavior, no external data, straightforward static definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS OpsWorks literals, no external input.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static constants, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.05.  \n**Discussion on risk score:** The 0.05 (5%) risk score appears to be an overestimate. The code is purely static, with no external data handling or execution. The minimal risk might be justified as a conservative default, but given the benign nature, a 0.0 would be more appropriate.  \n**Recommendation:** Lower `securityRisk` from 0.05 to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type definitions, no external input.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns, straightforward static code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS parameters; notes a future-dated copyright (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The future date is unusual but not malicious; it's likely a placeholder or typo. No dynamic code or external data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security.  \n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is; consider noting the date as a benign anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static, benign, and purely for type annotations.\n- The only minor inconsistency is in Report 3, where the `securityRisk` score of 0.05 seems slightly high given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 3's `securityRisk` score from 0.05 to 0.0** to better reflect the benign nature.\n- **Keep all other scores as is**, since they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, aside from negligible default scoring)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe type stub file for AWS resource literals, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No suspicious or malicious activity is present. The code is well-structured, static, and intended solely for type safety in Python projects.",
