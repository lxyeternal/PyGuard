{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS OpsWorks and related service constants to facilitate type annotations and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines constants and imports type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute code based on input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code solely establishes type literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a version check for Python's typing.Literal import, which is standard for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a series of Literal type annotations for various AWS resource and configuration constants. It imports 'Literal' appropriately based on Python version, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The licensing comment and documentation link are benign, and the structure is clear and standard for type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS-related string literals. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard type stub file designed for type safety and clarity in larger codebases.",
