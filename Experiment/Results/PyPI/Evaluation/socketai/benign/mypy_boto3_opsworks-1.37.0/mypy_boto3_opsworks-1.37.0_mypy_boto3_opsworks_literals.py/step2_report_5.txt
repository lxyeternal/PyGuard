  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static, declarative set of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal` types.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or input processing exists.\n- The code contains only constant string definitions for AWS resource identifiers, waiter names, regions, etc.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The only unusual point is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This suggests a placeholder or a typo, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS OpsWorks and related constants.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, straightforward, no dynamic behavior, no external data.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS and related service identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, static definitions, no external data or execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS OpsWorks and services.\n- **Analysis:** Static, no external input, no dynamic code.\n- **Note:** The `securityRisk` score is 0.05, which is very low but indicates a minimal potential concern.\n- **Observation:** The only minor anomaly is the risk score, which is still negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The low `securityRisk` score seems reasonable given the code's static nature. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Provide type annotations for AWS OpsWorks literals.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, static definitions, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS service parameter literals; notes the future copyright year.\n- **Analysis:** Static, no dynamic code or external data. The future date (2025) is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (slightly less, possibly due to the unusual date).\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent, just a minor anomaly in the copyright year.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** Purely static type alias definitions.\n- **Behavior:** No execution, no data flow, no external data handling.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Virtually zero; the only minor point is the future date in the copyright, which is not harmful.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- The very low `securityRisk` scores (0.05 or 0) are appropriate.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the assessments that the code is benign and purely declarative. I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThe only note is the future copyright year, which could be updated for accuracy but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, static type definition module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
