  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS OpsWorks and related resource identifiers for type safety.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. No dynamic code, external data, or executable logic exists. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and static. The malware scores are zero, obfuscation is absent, and security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS resource literals, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor future date is a non-issue. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
