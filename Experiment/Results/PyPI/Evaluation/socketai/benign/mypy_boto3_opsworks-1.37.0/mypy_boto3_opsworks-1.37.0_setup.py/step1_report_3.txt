  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-opsworks package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports from pathlib and setuptools modules; uses hardcoded package metadata and URLs; reads environment variable for Python version compatibility in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; does not include network operations, system calls, or external command executions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; static metadata used throughout, with no external input processing or dangerous data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. The script appears to be a standard Python package setup configuration with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing standard libraries and practices for Python package distribution. It reads a markdown file for documentation, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The only dynamic aspect is reading the README file, which is a typical pattern. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
