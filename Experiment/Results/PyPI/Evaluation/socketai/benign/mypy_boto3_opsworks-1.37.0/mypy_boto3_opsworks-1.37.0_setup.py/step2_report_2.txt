  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup configuration with no suspicious behavior, code obfuscation, or malicious activity. It reads a README file and calls `setup()` with static data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is perfect (1).\n- **Assessment:** Fully legitimate, no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the script is a typical setup script, reading static files and defining package metadata without any dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward setup script with no untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern — a typical package setup script with static data, no dynamic code, no network or user input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Clean and benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others; a standard setup script with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity (0). The code is purely a static setup script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected (0). The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk remains negligible (0).\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no obfuscation.\n- The only dynamic operation is reading a local README file, which is standard practice.\n- There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based on the analysis, I would concur with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**The code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.**",
