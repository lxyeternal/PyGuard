{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-opsworks' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ path for the README.md content, and reads the README.md file for long description. Uses static values for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. All data used in setup() are static or derived from the filesystem with no user input involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem read (README.md) into long_description parameter; static metadata assigned directly into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network calls are present. The dependencies are specified with a version constraint, and all data is static or filesystem-based, indicating a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
