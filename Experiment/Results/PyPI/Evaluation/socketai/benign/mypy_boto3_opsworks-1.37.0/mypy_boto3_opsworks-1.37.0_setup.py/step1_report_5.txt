  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-opsworks Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / \"README.md\" reading for long_description, and static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable, then into the setup() function for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. All data used is static or derived from local filesystem, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It safely handles package metadata and dependencies without engaging in any harmful activities.",
