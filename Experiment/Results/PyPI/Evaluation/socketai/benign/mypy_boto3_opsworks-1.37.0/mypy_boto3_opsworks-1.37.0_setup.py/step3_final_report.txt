  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with static metadata and no dynamic or untrusted input.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file, static package metadata, dependencies specified with version constraints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup() call; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted input. It reads a local README.md and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
