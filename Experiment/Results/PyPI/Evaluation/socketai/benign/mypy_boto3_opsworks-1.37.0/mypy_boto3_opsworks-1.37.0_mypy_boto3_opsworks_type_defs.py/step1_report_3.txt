  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS OpsWorks service data structures to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "All type definitions and data structure declarations, especially the import of data types and the TypedDict class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily defines data types without executing runtime operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only establishes static type schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely defines data structures. No functions or runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comprehensive type definitions for the AWS OpsWorks API using Python's TypedDict. It handles various request and response structures, which are typical for SDK or client library definitions. The use of conditional imports based on Python version, the absence of executable code or network operations, and no inclusion of obfuscated or dynamic code constructs indicate no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a well-structured schema definition file intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type definitions for the AWS OpsWorks SDK, with no malicious behavior detected. It contains no runtime logic, network access, or suspicious constructs. It is a legitimate, non-malicious schema definition file intended to aid static analysis and IDE support.",
