  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for AWS OpsWorks in Python.\n- **Sources:** Imports, conditional typing based on Python version, data class definitions.\n- **Sinks:** None; purely static type definitions.\n- **Flows:** No runtime data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Entirely static type annotations, no runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign schema definitions for static analysis; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or lower). The report's assigned malware=0 and risk=0 aligns well.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of type definitions.\n- No runtime or dynamic code, no external data or network activity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, purely structural code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or less. The report's scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on type annotations, data structures, and compatibility imports.\n- No runtime logic, external data, or dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate type definitions, no security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Matches the report's assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same observations: static type definitions, no runtime or external data.\n- No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: benign, SDK-like schema definitions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, purely type annotations and data schemas.\n- No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: safe, standard type definitions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that this code contains only static type annotations, TypedDicts, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and purely structural.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The obfuscated score of 0 is also correct since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is minimal, given the absence of runtime logic or external data handling. A score of 0.5 might be used as a baseline for non-executable code, but since there's no potential for malicious activity, a score of 0 is more justified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, static schema definition module with no malicious or security-sensitive content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores should be adjusted to reflect the benign nature: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**.",
