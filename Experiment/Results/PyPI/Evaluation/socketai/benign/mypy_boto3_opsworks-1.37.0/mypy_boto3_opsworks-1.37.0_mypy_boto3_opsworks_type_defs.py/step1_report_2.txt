  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS OpsWorks service API in Python",
  "sources": "None (no input/output data reading or external data sources used within the code, primarily type definitions)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or environment variable usage)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink as this code only defines types and data structures)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is consistent with type definitions, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and Union types for AWS OpsWorks API parameters and responses. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, but no runtime logic or data processing occurs. No suspicious imports, side effects, or hidden behaviors are present. The structure suggests it's a generated or maintained schema for type safety. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS OpsWorks API interactions, intended for type checking and validation. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
