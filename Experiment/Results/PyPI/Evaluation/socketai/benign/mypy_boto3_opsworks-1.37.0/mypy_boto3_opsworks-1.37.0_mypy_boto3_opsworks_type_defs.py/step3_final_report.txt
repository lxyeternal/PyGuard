  "purpose": "Static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS OpsWorks SDK in Python, intended for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports, conditional typing based on Python version, TypedDict definitions for request and response schemas.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static data schemas with no runtime data handling or external I/O.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; all definitions are static and type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, and conditional imports for compatibility. There is no executable logic, external data processing, or network activity. The structure is consistent, well-formed, and typical for SDK schema definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static schema for AWS OpsWorks API interactions, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk scores are justified as zero.",
