{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS OpsWorks service type definitions to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code defines TypedDicts and type aliases, imports, and module-level metadata. It reads configuration data, API parameters, and response structures from type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval/exec functions. The code primarily defines data structures and type aliases, with no direct data handling or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to type definitions; there are no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing in the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions and imports intended for static type checking of the AWS OpsWorks SDK in Python. It employs standard practices such as conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, and uses TypedDicts and Union types to model API request/response schemas. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The purpose is purely structural and type annotation oriented, with no runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS OpsWorks API interactions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks beyond the inherent trustworthiness of type definitions. It is unlikely to be malicious or harmful.",
