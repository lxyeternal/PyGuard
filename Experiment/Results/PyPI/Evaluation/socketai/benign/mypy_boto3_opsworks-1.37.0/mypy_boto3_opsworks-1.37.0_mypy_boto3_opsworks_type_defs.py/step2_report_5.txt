  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for AWS OpsWorks in Python.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no external data handling, no obfuscation. The code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Malware & security risk:** Clearly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS OpsWorks.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data sources, no suspicious imports or behavior.\n- **Malware & security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate schema definitions, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS OpsWorks.\n- **Analysis:** Entirely static type definitions, no runtime code, no external communication or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware & security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely structural, safe, and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS OpsWorks.\n- **Analysis:** No external input/output, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware & security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, schema-like code for static analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS OpsWorks.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no external data processing, no suspicious code constructs.\n- **Malware & security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no functions, no runtime logic, no external data processing, no network calls, no obfuscated code, and no embedded secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on malware score = 0 and obfuscated = 0.\n- **Security Risk:** The code's purpose is purely to provide type safety and documentation for the AWS SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The purpose is to define data structures for static type checking.\n- No runtime or external data handling occurs.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The inclusion of a copyright and documentation link is benign.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk from static type definitions)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in safety based on the analysis)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a comprehensive set of static type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS OpsWorks SDK in Python. It is standard, non-executable, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores provided in the reports are accurate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0",
