  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS OpsWorks service API in Python, used for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, conditional type imports based on Python version, and data class definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data handling or insecure data processing. No external data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data structures are defined as static type annotations without dynamic data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily consists of type definitions and imports. No obfuscated code, network operations, or security-sensitive logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations for various AWS OpsWorks API data structures, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes extensive TypedDict definitions for API request and response types, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard type definition module designed for static analysis and IDE support. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks present within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS OpsWorks SDK in Python. It contains no runtime code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
