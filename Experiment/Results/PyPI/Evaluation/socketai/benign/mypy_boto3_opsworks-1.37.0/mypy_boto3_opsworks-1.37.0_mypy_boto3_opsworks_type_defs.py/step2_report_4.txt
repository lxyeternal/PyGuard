  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Purpose & Content:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is a set of static type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS OpsWorks SDK in Python.\n- The code employs conditional imports for Python version compatibility, extensive TypedDict definitions for API request and response schemas, and Union types.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be generated or maintained schema files aimed at static type checking and IDE support.\n\n**Security & Malware Analysis:**\n- None of the reports detect any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or insecure data handling.\n- No network operations, file I/O, or other side effects.\n- The code's sole purpose is structural: defining data types and interfaces.\n\n**Potential Anomalies or Concerns:**\n- Slight mention of the copyright notice and documentation link, which are benign.\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion from the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, purely structural, and intended for static analysis.\n- No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.\n- The confidence level is high (mostly 1), and the obfuscated/malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Code Content & Logic:**\n- The code is purely type annotations with no runtime logic.\n- No external data sources, no network or file operations, no data sinks.\n- The conditional imports are standard for cross-version compatibility.\n\n**Malware & Security Risks:**\n- Given the absence of runtime code, dynamic execution, or external I/O, the risk of malware is effectively zero.\n- No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns.\n- The copyright and documentation links are benign.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified; purely static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a well-structured, static schema of type annotations for AWS OpsWorks API, intended for static type checking, with no runtime or security-sensitive operations. It is safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNo changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.",
