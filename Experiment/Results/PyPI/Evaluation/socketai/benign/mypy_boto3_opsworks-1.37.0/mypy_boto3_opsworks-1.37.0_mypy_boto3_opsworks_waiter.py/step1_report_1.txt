  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter subclasses for the AWS OpsWorks service client, providing typed waiters for different resource states.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, imported modules, class method parameters with type annotations, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions and class inheritance for AWS SDK waiters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several waiter subclasses inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, with type annotations for wait methods using Unpack of specific request types. No dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or external data handling is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are detected. The code's structure, including imports, class definitions, and docstrings, aligns with standard type annotation practices for SDKs. The overall purpose appears to be to enhance type safety and clarity for AWS resource waiter interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, focused on type annotations and class inheritance for AWS waiters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for type hinting support.",
