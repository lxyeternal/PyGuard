  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Describes type annotations and waiter subclasses for AWS OpsWorks, with extensive documentation links. The code is straightforward class inheritance with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no external data handling, no obfuscation. The report correctly identifies the code as purely structural and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, providing typed waiter subclasses with detailed documentation. Uses conditional import for `Unpack`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no external data or network activity, no obfuscation. The code is for type safety and documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines custom waiters with type annotations, similar pattern, with version-dependent import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation. It’s a clean, type-focused implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar class definitions with type annotations, serving as wrappers for AWS waiters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no dynamic code, no external data handling. The code is purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines typed waiters, with no external data or logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and documentation-oriented.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, external data handling, or security issues, the risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, providing type annotations and class inheritance for AWS SDK waiters.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted input.\n- The use of type annotations and documentation links is standard practice for SDK type stubs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0** for all reports.\n- The current assessments are accurate and justified based on the code provided.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions that the code is safe, well-structured, and purely for type hinting purposes.**",
