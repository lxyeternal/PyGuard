{
  "purpose": "Define specific waiter classes for AWS OpsWorks service, providing type annotations and documentation for use with boto3 waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class method parameters using Unpack with various type defs",
  "sinks": "Methods 'wait' with **kwargs unpacked from type definitions, which could potentially handle untrusted data, but in context, they are used as parameters for AWS SDK waiters",
  "flows": "Code flows from instantiation of waiter classes to calling 'wait' with kwargs unpacked from predefined type definitions; no direct user input or network interactions within this code",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors; documentation and type annotations are standard; no dynamic code execution or network activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter with method 'wait' accepting unpacked parameters from specific type definitions. These classes serve as typed wrappers around AWS waiters. The implementation relies entirely on well-defined AWS SDK patterns, with no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears to be purely for type annotation and documentation enhancement, with no runtime malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, serving as type-safe wrappers for AWS OpsWorks waiters with no signs of malware or security risks. It is well-structured, documented, and does not contain malicious behavior.",
