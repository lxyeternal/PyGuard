  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for AWS OpsWorks waiters to facilitate type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from botocore.waiter.Waiter, type definitions imported from .type_defs, documentation links, conditional import for Unpack based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, no network calls, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions, no external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, with method signatures using type annotations from imported type defs. It includes documentation links and version-dependent imports for Unpack. There are no runtime data flows, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward, serving as type stubs for SDK waiters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, intended for type annotations and documentation support for AWS SDK waiters. It contains no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks.",
