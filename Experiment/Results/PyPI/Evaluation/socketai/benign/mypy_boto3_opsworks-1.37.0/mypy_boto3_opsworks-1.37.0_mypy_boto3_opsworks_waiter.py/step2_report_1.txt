  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and is intended for type annotations.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The code only defines classes and methods with documentation and type annotations. No issues found.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of external data handling, code execution, or suspicious logic.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is straightforward, focused on type annotations and class inheritance.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, no signs of malicious activity, no external data handling, and the code is purely for type annotations.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid. The code is safe and serves documentation and type safety purposes.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, with emphasis on the lack of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is just class definitions and type annotations with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.  \n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (type annotations, class inheritance, documentation), a risk score of 0 is appropriate. No security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic beyond class inheritance and method signatures.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data processing occurs.\n- The documentation links and type annotations are standard for SDK type hinting.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, intended for type safety, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign. The scores are reasonable, and there is no need for adjustments. The code is safe, well-structured, and purely for type annotation purposes.",
