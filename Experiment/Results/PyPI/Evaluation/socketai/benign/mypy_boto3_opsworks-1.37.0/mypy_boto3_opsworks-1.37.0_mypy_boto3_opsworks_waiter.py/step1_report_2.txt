{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and structured waiter classes for AWS OpsWorks client in boto3, facilitating wait operations with proper type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters using Unpack with specific type defs.",
  "sinks": "The code defines classes and methods with no external data sinks or network operations; no untrusted data handling or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Class wait methods accept keyword arguments typed with specific request wait type defs, but do not process or pass data further. No external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward, mostly class and method definitions with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines typed waiter subclasses for AWS OpsWorks, with comprehensive documentation links. It imports standard and type-related modules, and uses conditional import for Unpack based on Python version. No code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic is present. The methods only override the 'wait' method with typed parameters, and contain docstrings linking to documentation. The overall structure is clean, focusing on type annotations and class hierarchies without any embedded malicious behavior or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, type-annotated set of AWS waiter classes for boto3, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for typing and documentation purposes, with no suspicious behavior or malicious payloads detected.",
