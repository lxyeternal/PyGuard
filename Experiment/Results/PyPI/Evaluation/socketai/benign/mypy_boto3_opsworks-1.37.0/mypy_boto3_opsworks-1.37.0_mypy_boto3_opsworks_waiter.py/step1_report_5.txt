{
  "purpose": "Defines typed waiters for the AWS OpsWorks service client to facilitate waiting for specific resource states.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read. The code mainly defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets are present; the methods are placeholders with no internal logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code only declares class structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward class definitions with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines multiple waiter subclasses for AWS OpsWorks, and annotates wait() methods with precise type hints. The classes inherit from boto3's Waiter and do not contain any executable logic or external data handling. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is solely to provide typed waiters for better code assistance. The code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate SDK extension for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation module for AWS OpsWorks waiters. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It functions solely to improve type safety and documentation for SDK users.",
