{
  "purpose": "Defines custom waiters for AWS OpsWorks service client with specific type annotations for better static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.waiter, type definitions from local type_defs module, sys module for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; code primarily defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; method signatures include **kwargs with specific type definitions, but no dynamic or insecure handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is primarily class definitions with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type-annotated subclasses of the Waiter class for various AWS OpsWorks waiters, with methods 'wait' accepting specific keyword argument types. It conditionally imports Unpack from typing_extensions or typing based on Python version. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code injection. No external data sources or sinks are present. It solely provides type definitions and documentation links for clarity and tooling support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, well-structured module focused on type annotations and class definitions for AWS waiters. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
