  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and subclasses for AWS OpsWorks waiters, with documentation links.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely structural, for type safety, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or 0), but given the report's confidence (1), a risk score of 0 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for boto3 waiters.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No code execution, external data, or suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, purely for type hinting, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or lower; the report assigns 0, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiters with type annotations, using sys for version checking.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no external data handling, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for type annotations and documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or lower; the report assigns 0, which aligns with this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or lower; the report assigns 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines typed waiters, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, for documentation and type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 or lower; the report assigns 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0). The code is purely structural, intended for type annotations and class inheritance for AWS SDK waiters.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—definitions, type annotations, no runtime logic, no external data, no network activity—the risk score should be minimal, around 0 or 0.1 at most.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is static, purely for type safety, and contains no runtime logic that could be malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The purpose is to enhance developer experience with type hints, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected.                             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation.      |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Very minimal; primarily type annotations with no runtime logic.    |\n\n**Note:** The slight increase in risk score (0.1) accounts for the fact that the code interacts with AWS SDK components, but this is standard and not risky in itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for type annotations and documentation support for AWS SDK waiters. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
