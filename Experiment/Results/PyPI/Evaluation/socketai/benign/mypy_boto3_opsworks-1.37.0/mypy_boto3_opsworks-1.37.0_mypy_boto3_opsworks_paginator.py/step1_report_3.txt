{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a paginator class for the AWS OpsWorks service, specifically for the 'describe_ecs_clusters' operation.",
  "sources": "Reads are from imported modules (sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs). No user input or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code defines class structures and a method signature for pagination, without runtime data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard type annotation and class extension for boto3 pagination.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type definitions and a paginator class for AWS boto3 service, using conditional imports for compatibility and type checking. No external data processing or network activity occurs. The class and method only define interfaces and do not contain runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type annotation and class extension for boto3 pagination, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, safe module for type hinting in AWS SDK usage.",
