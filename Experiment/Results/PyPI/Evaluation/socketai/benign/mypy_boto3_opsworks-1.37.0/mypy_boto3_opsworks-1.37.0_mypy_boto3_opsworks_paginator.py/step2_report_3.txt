  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as providing type annotations and a paginator class for AWS OpsWorks. The sources are standard imports and type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external data flows; input flows into AWS API calls, which is normal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward, focusing on type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent or security issues detected. Confidence is high (1). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations and class extension for boto3 pagination.\n- No external data processing, no suspicious logic.\n- The code is standard for SDK typing support.\n- Malware score remains 0, and confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on the specific paginator for `describe_ecs_clusters`.\n- No user input, external data, or runtime logic.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score is 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes the code as a type annotation wrapper for the ECS clusters paginator.\n- No data leaks, no external data handling.\n- No anomalies, straightforward SDK interface.\n- Malware score 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing type safety and class extension.\n- No malicious behaviors, no suspicious code.\n- No data leaks or external system modifications.\n- Malware score 0, confidence 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely for type annotations and class extension to facilitate type safety in AWS SDK usage.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe type stub for AWS SDK pagination.
