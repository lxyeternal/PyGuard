{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator class for the AWS OpsWorks 'describe_ecs_clusters' API, enhancing code clarity and type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, class definition, method definition, docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified. The code primarily defines classes and types for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code serves as a type annotation and class structure without executing data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code appears to be standard type-annotated SDK wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from Paginator with overridden paginate method, and includes detailed docstrings linking to documentation. The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions without any runtime logic or data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage are present. It appears to be a straightforward type stub for boto3 paginator interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and class wrapper for boto3 AWS SDK paginator functionality. There are no indicators of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks. It functions solely as a type safety aid for SDK usage.",
