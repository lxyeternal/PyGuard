  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for AWS OpsWorks paginator, providing type safety and documentation support.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type definitions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to the 'paginate' method flow into AWS SDK calls; no data processing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard patterns for SDK type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK stub for type annotations, involving class inheritance and method signatures without runtime logic or data handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The use of conditional imports and type annotations aligns with best practices for compatibility and type safety. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data processing are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation module for AWS SDK pagination. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
