  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Content**:\n   - The code provides type annotations and a paginator class for AWS OpsWorks, specifically for the `describe_ecs_clusters` operation.\n   - It imports standard modules, uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and defines a class extending `Paginator`.\n   - The `paginate` method accepts `**kwargs` with specific type annotations and returns a `PageIterator`.\n   - The code contains only documentation, class definitions, and type annotations; no runtime logic, data processing, or external system interactions.\n\n2. **Potential Issues & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is purely for type safety and interface definition for boto3 paginators.\n   - The use of `kwargs` is standard for AWS SDK paginators, and the code doesn't process or trust external data beyond passing parameters to AWS SDK methods.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`. Given the absence of any malicious patterns, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the code's nature—no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, documentation-focused, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is for type annotations and class extension, with no data leaks or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code is a stub for type safety, not runtime logic.\n   - No external inputs are processed insecurely.\n   - The use of `Unpack` and conditional imports is standard for compatibility.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for AWS SDK pagination.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code appears safe, non-malicious, and purely for type safety enhancement. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
