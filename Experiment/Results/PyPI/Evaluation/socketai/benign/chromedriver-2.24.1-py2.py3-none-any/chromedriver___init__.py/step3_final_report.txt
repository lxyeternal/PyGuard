  "purpose": "Determine the platform-specific path to the ChromeDriver binary, verify its existence, and append it to the system PATH environment variable for use in automation/testing environments.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.isfile, platform.system(), platform.uname()",
  "sinks": "os.environ['PATH'] += ':' + CHROMEDRV_PATH",
  "flows": "Platform detection -> Path construction -> File existence check -> Environment variable modification",
  "anomalies": "Uses ':' as path separator unconditionally, which may cause issues on Windows where ';' is standard; no validation of environment modification; no obfuscation or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code detects the current platform, constructs a path to the ChromeDriver binary accordingly, checks for its existence, and appends its directory to the system PATH. It performs standard setup operations without any hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of ':' as a separator in environment variable modification, which is correct for Unix-like systems but not for Windows. Overall, the code is straightforward, benign, and typical for environment setup in automation contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for locating and adding ChromeDriver to the system PATH, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The only technical note is the platform-specific path separator, which could be improved for cross-platform robustness.",
