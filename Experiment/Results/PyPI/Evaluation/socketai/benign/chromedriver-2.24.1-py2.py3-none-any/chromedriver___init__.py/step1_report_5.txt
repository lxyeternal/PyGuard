{
  "purpose": "Configure the path to the ChromeDriver executable based on the operating system and add it to the system PATH environment variable.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), system platform information (platform.system()), and platform architecture (platform.uname()).",
  "sinks": "Modifies the environment variable 'PATH' to include the ChromeDriver path.",
  "flows": "The script determines the executable location based on OS and architecture, then updates the environment PATH variable to include this location, allowing other processes to find ChromeDriver.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The code simply locates an executable and updates environment variables. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no data leakage mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the directory of the current script, constructs a platform-specific path to the ChromeDriver executable, verifies its existence, and appends its directory to the system PATH. The logic is straightforward, platform-aware, and lacks any malicious operations. No suspicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It functions solely to set up environment configuration for WebDriver usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup utility for configuring the environment for ChromeDriver. It performs no malicious actions, contains no malware, and does not pose a security threat. It simply prepares the environment for Selenium or similar tools. Overall, the script is benign.",
