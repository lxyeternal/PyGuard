  "purpose": "Configure the path to the ChromeDriver executable based on the operating system and add it to the system PATH.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's directory path (__base_path), system platform information (__platform_name), and checks for the existence of the ChromeDriver file (__base_path, __platform_name).",
  "sinks": "Modifies the environment variable 'PATH' to include the ChromeDriver path.",
  "flows": "Reads system and file information to determine platform-specific path; if the ChromeDriver exists, appends its directory to the environment PATH.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a platform-specific check and appends a path without validation, but this is standard behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious file handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a platform-specific path for the ChromeDriver executable, raising an error if the file does not exist. It then appends this path to the system environment PATH variable. No data is read from untrusted sources; the only inputs are system paths and platform info. The modification of PATH is straightforward and based solely on local filesystem checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup routine for configuring the ChromeDriver path. It performs platform detection, file existence validation, and updates the environment PATH. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
