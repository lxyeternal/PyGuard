  "purpose": "Determine the correct path to the ChromeDriver executable based on the system platform and add it to the system PATH environment variable.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (platform.system(), platform.uname()), reading __file__ to determine directory, checking file existence with os.path.isfile.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variable 'PATH' with os.environ['PATH'].",
  "flows": "Source: platform.system(), platform.uname(), __file__ -> Sink: os.environ['PATH'] modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code performs platform detection and path setup, which is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a path to the ChromeDriver based on the current operating system, checks for its existence, and raises an error if missing. It then appends this path to the system PATH environment variable. All operations are straightforward file system checks and environment modifications. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated behavior, or suspicious network activity. The code is focused on setup for a specific dependency (ChromeDriver) and does not include any covert or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script to locate and include ChromeDriver in the system path. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign configuration script intended for environment setup.",
