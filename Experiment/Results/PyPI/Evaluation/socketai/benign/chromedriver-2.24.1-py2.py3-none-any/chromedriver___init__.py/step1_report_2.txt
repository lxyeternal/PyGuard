{
  "purpose": "To determine the platform-specific path for the ChromeDriver executable and add it to the system PATH environment variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the script's directory path (__base_path), platform information (platform.system() and platform.uname()), and checks for the existence of the ChromeDriver file (os.path.isfile).",
  "sinks": "Modifies the environment variable 'PATH' by appending the ChromeDriver path, potentially affecting subsequent process executions.",
  "flows": "Reads input paths and platform info -> Checks for file existence -> Appends ChromeDriver path to environment variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; the code straightforwardly handles paths and environment variables. The only potential concern is appending to 'PATH' without validation, but it's standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to a ChromeDriver binary based on the platform, verifies its existence, and updates the environment PATH variable accordingly. It uses standard Python modules and functions, performs platform-specific logic, and raises an error if the binary is not found. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code's intent appears benign and typical for setup or configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script securely configures the environment to include the ChromeDriver binary based on the current platform. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected; the code is standard for setting up dependencies for automation or testing purposes.",
