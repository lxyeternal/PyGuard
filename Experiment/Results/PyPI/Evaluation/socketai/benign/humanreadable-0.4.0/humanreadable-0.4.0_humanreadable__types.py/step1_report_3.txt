{
  "purpose": "Define protocol and type aliases for handling unit-like objects and their properties, with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and local '_typing' module; class definition with property declarations.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data input or output points; no user input, network, or file handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code is purely type annotation and protocol definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard type hinting and protocol pattern. Conditional import for backward compatibility is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol 'SupportsUnit' with properties 'name' and 'regexp' using typing.Protocol. It includes conditional imports for 'Literal' and 'Protocol' to support Python versions prior to 3.8. Type aliases for units and style are also declared. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. The code serves purely as type annotations and interface definitions, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation setup defining a protocol and related type aliases for units. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security issues present. It appears safe and standard for type hinting purposes.",
