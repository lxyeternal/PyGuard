{
  "purpose": "Defines type hints, protocols, and type aliases for handling units and styles, likely for a library related to parsing or formatting units.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing module and local fallback; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of conditional import for backward compatibility is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations and protocols using Python's typing system. It includes a try-except for imports to maintain compatibility with older Python versions. No external data input, network calls, or file operations are present. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and aligned with common type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup of type hints and protocols for a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident.",
