  "purpose": "Define type protocols and type aliases for units and text styles, with conditional import handling for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and local fallback module; class definition for SupportsUnit.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly type definitions and property declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and protocol definitions, with a fallback import for compatibility across Python versions. It uses standard Python typing constructs and does not include any executable logic, input/output operations, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward type definition module intended for type checking and compatibility. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
