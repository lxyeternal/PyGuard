  "purpose": "Define type protocols and type aliases related to unit support and styling options, with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' module and local fallback, class definitions, and type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no user input or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; primarily type annotations and class protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. Use of conditional import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type annotations, protocols, and type aliases for further use in larger codebase. The conditional import caters to compatibility across Python versions. No data input, external connections, or any behavior that could be malicious is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for type hinting and protocol definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup of type protocols and aliases with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase for type checking purposes.",
