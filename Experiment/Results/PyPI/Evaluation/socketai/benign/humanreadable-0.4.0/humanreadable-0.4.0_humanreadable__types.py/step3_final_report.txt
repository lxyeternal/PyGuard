  "purpose": "Define type annotations and protocols for support units with compatibility handling for Python versions prior to 3.8.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports from standard library modules and local fallback.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output or external sinks; purely type hinting.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, a protocol class with property definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility with older Python versions. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The code is standard for type hinting and interface definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for type hinting and compatibility. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
