  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: type definitions, protocols, conditional imports for compatibility, no runtime logic, no data handling.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for type hinting, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are all zero or very low for malware and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code is purely type definitions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; same reasoning.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; purely type annotations.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard type hinting.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; type and protocol definitions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is a standard type definition module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
