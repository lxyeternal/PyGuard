  "purpose": "Define type hints, protocols, and type aliases for handling units and styles in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and local module '_typing'; class SupportsUnit with property definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data output, external connections, or command executions present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; the code only defines types and protocols without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import handling for compatibility; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward type hinting and protocol definitions. It conditionally imports 'Literal' and 'Protocol' for compatibility with Python versions earlier than 3.8, using a fallback import from a local module. It defines a 'SupportsUnit' protocol with properties 'name' and 'regexp' that return a string and a regex pattern, respectively. It then creates type aliases for tuples of strings, dictionaries mapping 'SupportsUnit' instances to such tuples, and a 'Literal' type for style options. There are no runtime data flows, no external calls, and no suspicious logic. The code serves as a type interface layer, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type and protocol definition for use within a larger application. It includes compatibility handling for different Python versions and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
