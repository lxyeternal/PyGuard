  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for parsing and converting human-readable bit rate strings. It presents no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is overly cautious; it should be set to 0, reflecting the code's safety and static nature."
