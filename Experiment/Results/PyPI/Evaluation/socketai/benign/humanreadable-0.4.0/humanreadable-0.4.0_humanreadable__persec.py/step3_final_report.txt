  "purpose": "Utility class for parsing human-readable bit rate strings into numeric values and supporting various units.",
  "sources": "Static regex patterns compiled at import, internal class methods, no external data or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Internal calculations and string formatting; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex parsing -> internal conversion properties -> output numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static regex patterns for various bit rate units, compiles them at import, and provides properties for converting human-readable strings into numeric bit rate values. It uses standard Python features such as data classes, properties, and comparison operators. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The regex patterns are static and compiled at import, with no influence from external input during execution. The class methods perform safe calculations and formatting. The minimal security concern arises from regex pattern matching, but since patterns are static and input is parsed internally, this is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for parsing and converting human-readable bit rate strings. It presents no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is overly cautious; it should be set to 0, reflecting the code's safety and static nature.",
