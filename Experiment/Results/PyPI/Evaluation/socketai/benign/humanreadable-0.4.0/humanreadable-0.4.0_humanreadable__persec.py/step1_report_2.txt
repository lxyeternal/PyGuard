{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for parsing and converting human-readable bit per second strings into numeric values and supporting various unit conversions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections, dataclasses, decimal, typing), internal modules (. _base, _common, _types). No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Property methods and functions that perform calculations and return numeric values based on internal data. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed during initialization (not shown explicitly here), converted into numeric representations via class methods and properties, which are used internally for calculations. No data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is present. The code appears well-structured and legitimate for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a unit conversion class for human-readable bandwidth strings. It uses standard Python libraries, data classes, and regex patterns for parsing units. No external data sources, network operations, or potentially malicious features are evident. All functions and properties perform calculations or string formatting for unit conversions, with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for parsing and converting human-readable bandwidth units. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be for utility purposes, with no external network interactions or hidden functions.",
