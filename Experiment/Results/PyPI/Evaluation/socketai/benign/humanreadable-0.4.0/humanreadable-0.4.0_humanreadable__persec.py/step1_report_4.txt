{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for converting human-readable bit rate strings into numerical values and supports unit conversions, formatting, and comparisons for bit rates.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions for pattern matching, data structures, and typing; it does not read external inputs or untrusted data directly within this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process or output untrusted data or perform network communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable; the code performs internal calculations and data conversions without external data handling or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and focused on unit conversions and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for handling various bit rate units with regex patterns, properties for conversions, comparison operators, and formatting methods. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, type hints, and class properties. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data access. The logic appears focused on unit conversion and comparison operations without external side-effects or data leakage points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of unit conversion for bit rates. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no external communication. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on this fragment.",
