{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to parse and handle human-readable values with units, enabling conversion between units and validation of input.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'readable_value' parameter in the __init__ and __split_unit methods, which are used to initialize and process user-provided strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, as the code primarily processes and validates input data without writing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Input string -> __split_unit (regex search for unit, extract number) -> __to_number (convert string to Decimal) -> get_as (convert to specified unit). No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on regex for unit detection, but no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs are found; all functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, unit normalization, and number parsing without executing external commands, network operations, or handling sensitive data beyond basic validation. It uses regex for parsing, which is safe in this context. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The use of type hints and structured error handling suggests a focus on robustness rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for parsing human-readable values with units, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or access to sensitive data. Overall, it seems safe and purposefully designed for its intended functionality.",
