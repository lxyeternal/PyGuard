{
  "purpose": "This code provides an abstract base class for handling human-readable values with units, including parsing, normalization, and conversion functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the constructor parameter 'readable_value' and 'default_unit'. It also reads unit definitions from 'self._text_units' and 'self._units'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'cast' in '_normalize_unit' and the regex search on 'readable_value'. No data is sent externally, and there are no network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed to extract numerical values and units, normalized against available units, and converted to Decimal objects. The flow involves regex matching, unit normalization, and number parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'cast' for 'unit' in '_normalize_unit' appears safe; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears focused on parsing and validation with no hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class for handling human-readable measurements with units. It employs regex for parsing numeric and unit parts, performs normalization with unit definitions, and converts strings to Decimal numbers. No external network or file system operations are present. The usage of regex and typecasting is standard and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code performs expected parsing and validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of parsing and handling human-readable unit values. It performs no network, file, or data exfiltration activities. There are no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The only potential concern is the regex for number parsing, which is standard and not malicious. Overall, the code seems safe and benign.",
