{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for handling human-readable values with units, including parsing, normalization, and conversion functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input comes from the 'readable_value' parameter passed to the constructor and the 'unit' parameter in '_normalize_unit' and '__split_unit' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send data to external systems, files, or network endpoints. It mainly processes and transforms input data internally.",
  "flows": "Input string 'readable_value' flows through '__preprocess', which calls '__split_unit' and '__to_number' for validation and parsing, then stored as internal Decimal and unit objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated code are present. The code uses regular expressions and type casting properly. No code injection vectors are apparent. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is the regex pattern matching, but it is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs parsing and validation of input strings representing numerical values with units. It uses regex to identify numeric patterns and unit patterns, normalizes units via a list of supported units, and converts numbers to Decimal for precision. No external network calls, file I/O, or sensitive data handling are present. The code appears to be a well-structured data processing utility with standard validation steps. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a secure, well-structured component intended for parsing and handling human-readable values with units. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs internal validation and data conversion without external interactions or suspicious behavior.",
