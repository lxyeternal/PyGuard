{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class for parsing human-readable values with units, validating input, normalizing units, and converting to numeric form.",
  "sources": "Reads input string 'readable_value' and optional 'default_unit'; accesses '_text_units' and '_units' for validation and normalization.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points; primarily internal validation and parsing.",
  "flows": "Input string is validated and split into numeric and unit parts; unit normalization and number conversion flow from input to internal representation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; regex pattern is simple and safe; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; use of 'cast' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, regex-based parsing, unit normalization, and number conversion without external interactions or malicious patterns. The regex pattern is simple, minimizing ReDoS risk. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is a straightforward utility with minimal security concerns, primarily related to regex parsing which is standard and unlikely to be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for parsing human-readable values with units. No malicious activity, external data flow, or obfuscation is evident. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the assessments in the reports are justified.",
