{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract class for handling human-readable values with units, providing methods for parsing, normalizing, and converting units and values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings (readable_value) for processing, and uses regex to parse numeric and unit components.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include regex searches and splits which could be exploited with specially crafted input strings, but no direct data leak or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Input string → regex match and split → conversion to Decimal → processing and validation, with no external system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. No use of network, file I/O, or system commands. The code primarily performs data parsing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a parsing utility for human-readable unit-based values. It uses regex for matching numeric and unit patterns, performs unit normalization, and converts strings to Decimal numbers. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The only minor concern could be that regex patterns are used to parse input, which, if supplied maliciously, might cause Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) via crafted input strings, but this is a low likelihood given the simplicity of the regex. Overall, the code does not exhibit any malware behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for parsing and handling human-readable values with units. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and no security risks are evident beyond minor input validation concerns. It is safe for use.",
