{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement an abstract class for handling human-readable values with units, providing methods for parsing, normalizing, and converting units.",
  "sources": "Reading input through the constructor parameter 'readable_value', and unit normalization via '_normalize_unit'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'cast' function on 'unit' in '_normalize_unit', which could be misused if input is manipulated; however, it is a type cast with no direct impact. No other explicit sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string 'readable_value' is processed to extract numerical part and unit, with normalization and validation steps, and then converted to a number.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code performs expected parsing functions with regular expressions and type checks. No code injection points are evident. The use of 'cast' is benign here, used for type hinting. No network, file, or system manipulation occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for parsing human-readable values with units. It uses regex to identify numeric parts, normalizes units against a list, and converts values to Decimal. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The only potential concern is the reliance on regex and typecasting, but these are standard for parsing. Overall, the code is a straightforward parsing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for parsing and handling human-readable values with units. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and aligned with expected functionality for such a utility.",
