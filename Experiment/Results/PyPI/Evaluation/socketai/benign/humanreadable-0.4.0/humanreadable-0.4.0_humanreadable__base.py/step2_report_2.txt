  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is an abstract class for parsing human-readable values with units. It uses regex for parsing, normalizes units, and converts values to Decimal. No external data, network, or system manipulation. No suspicious code patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk reflects minimal concern, mainly about potential parsing issues, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on input validation and parsing. No external data or malicious behaviors. Regex is used safely, with minor concern about ReDoS, but unlikely given simplicity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1. No malicious intent, just parsing logic. Slightly higher security risk due to regex parsing concern, but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same core logic, with emphasis on regex parsing and unit normalization. No network, file, or data exfiltration. Potential ReDoS concern is minimal.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malware. The parsing approach is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, with detailed validation steps. No external interactions or suspicious code. Regex usage is straightforward.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Very high confidence in safety. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, focusing on parsing, normalization, and validation. No external or malicious actions.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with others, safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is an abstract class for parsing human-readable values with units. It does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate zero malware, which aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily related to regex parsing concerns, but these are standard and not malicious.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk ≈ 0.1–0.2) are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- No changes needed; the code appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly about input validation robustness)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard parsing utility with no malicious behaviors, external dependencies, or obfuscation. The slight risk reflects potential parsing edge cases but is not significant.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no malware or malicious intent detected. The scores are appropriate, and I concur with the overall assessment.",
