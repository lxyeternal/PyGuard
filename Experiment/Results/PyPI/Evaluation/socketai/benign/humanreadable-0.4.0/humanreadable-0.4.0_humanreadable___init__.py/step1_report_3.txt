{
  "purpose": "This code module imports metadata attributes and classes or functions related to units and errors, then defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (__version__, _persec, _time, error). No external input sources or data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or leaked. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows. The code only performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and primarily for module setup, with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata and classes/variables from internal modules, then defines an __all__ list for exports. It lacks any data input, network activity, or execution logic. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior. It appears to be a standard module setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and export definition for a Python module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a module interface definition.",
