{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, used to define package metadata and publicly expose classes and errors for import.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (__version__, _persec, _time, error), reading data from module attributes and classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used, no data leakage or unsafe operations are present",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward import and export of module attributes and classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual behavior. The code solely manages module metadata and exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific attributes and classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for export. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or sensitive data manipulation is present. The structure and content are typical for Python package initialization files, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, serving to organize and expose package components. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
