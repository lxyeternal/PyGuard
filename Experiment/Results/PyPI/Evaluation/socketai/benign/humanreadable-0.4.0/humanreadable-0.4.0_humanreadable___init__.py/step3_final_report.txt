  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of package metadata, classes, and error definitions.",
  "sources": "Internal modules: __version__, _persec, _time, error",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements, no data flow or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal modules, defining __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports internal metadata and classes, then defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, network activity, or data leaks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
