{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initializer or export module, exposing version info, error classes, and measurement classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (__version__, _persec, _time, error). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, network communication, or sensitive information processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, exporting defined classes and variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata and classes from internal modules, then defines __all__ for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure is standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module export file with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It solely manages exports and metadata without handling untrusted input or executing external code.",
