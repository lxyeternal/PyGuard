{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an __init__.py file, setting up package metadata and exposing certain classes and exceptions for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __email__, __license__, __version__) and imports classes and exceptions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data. No external data outputs or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. Imports are static, and metadata variables are likely predefined strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata variables and specific classes/exceptions from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for public API. No input reading, no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code constructs. It functions as a typical package __init__.py file without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It merely re-exports components for package users.",
