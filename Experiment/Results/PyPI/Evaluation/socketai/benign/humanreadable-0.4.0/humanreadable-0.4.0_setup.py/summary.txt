  "conclusion": "The code is typical for a setup script and does not contain active malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of exec() on a local version file, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. Therefore, the malware score should be increased from 0 to around 0.5 to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk slightly adjusted upward. No obfuscation is present. Ensuring the integrity of '__version__.py' mitigates this risk."
