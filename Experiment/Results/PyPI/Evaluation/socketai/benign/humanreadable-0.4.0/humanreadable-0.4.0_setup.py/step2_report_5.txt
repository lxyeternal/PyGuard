  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1. **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.  \n   - No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is observed.  \n   - The only notable concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `__version__.py`.\n\n2. **Use of `exec()` on `__version__.py`:**  \n   - This is a common pattern in setup scripts but carries security risks if the version file is compromised or maliciously altered.  \n   - The reports correctly flag this as a potential vulnerability, though they note that in typical use, this is considered acceptable if the version file is trusted.\n\n3. **Conditional Import of `ReleaseCommand`:**  \n   - This import appears benign; it is conditional and within a try-except block.  \n   - No malicious behavior is implied here.\n\n4. **No Suspicious or Malicious Behavior:**  \n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious code.  \n   - No external network activity or untrusted data processing is present.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk / Risk Score:**  \n     - The primary concern is the use of `exec()`. While common, it can be exploited if `__version__.py` is compromised.  \n     - The reports assign a risk score of around 0.2 to 0.3, which seems reasonable given the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is tampered with.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the reasoning provided.  \n   - The malware score remains at 0, reflecting no malicious intent.  \n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- The main point of concern is the use of `exec()`. If the `__version__.py` file is securely maintained and verified, the risk remains low.  \n- No changes are necessary to the malware or obfuscated scores.  \n- The risk score could be slightly increased if there's concern about the integrity of `__version__.py`, but given the standard practice, 0.2–0.3 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent.  \n- The use of `exec()` is a known pattern but should be used with trusted files.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity observed)  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (due to `exec()` on a local file, which is a known risk but common in setup scripts)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe if the `__version__.py` file is secure. The primary concern is the `exec()` call, but it is a standard pattern in setup scripts. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present.",
