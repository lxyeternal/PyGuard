  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes an extension of the 'typing' module with various type constructs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Complex conditional imports, metaclasses, and internal helpers are standard for a typing extension library.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; code is for static analysis support.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious extension.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on compatibility and type extension support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Extensive compatibility handling, dynamic class definitions, and internal attribute access, but all standard for such a library.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; purely for static type support.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Reports 3 & 4:**\n- **Issue:** Empty responses.\n- **Analysis:** No code or context provided; cannot evaluate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with complex compatibility code for type extension features.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic class creation, exec(), internal typing attributes, but all within the scope of static type extension support.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; code is for static type annotations and backward compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence & Content:** All reports (except 3 & 4, which are empty) contain complex, version-dependent definitions for type hints, protocols, and compatibility layers.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, no obfuscation, no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely for static type extension, with no runtime data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Given the nature, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. Obfuscated score is 0 as the code is transparent but complex. Risk score remains at 0, as there's no security threat.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. The only concern might be the complexity, but that is typical for such a library and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The empty reports (3 & 4) should be disregarded or marked as invalid due to lack of content.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is a legitimate, complex extension of the 'typing' module with no malicious or security issues.",
