  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\nReport 1:\n- Purpose: Extends 'typing' with advanced features.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, no data leaks, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate static type extension code.\n- Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\nAssessment: The report's reasoning is sound. The code is complex but standard for typing extensions, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\nReport 2:\n- Purpose: Similar to report 1, focuses on type hinting and compatibility.\n- Findings: No external data processing, no network activity, no backdoors.\n- Conclusion: Non-malicious, compatibility layer code.\n- Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\nAssessment: The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. It is a compatibility and extension library, with no malicious intent.\n\nReports 3 & 4:\n- Errors: Empty responses.\n\nAssessment: No data to analyze; these can be disregarded.\n\nReport 5:\n- Purpose: Similar to previous reports, extending typing support with compatibility.\n- Findings: No external input processing, no network, no data exfiltration.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity, standard for type extension modules.\n- Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.95.\n\nAssessment: The detailed reasoning indicates no malicious intent. The code is complex but standard for such libraries.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- The code is a comprehensive, version-compatible extension of Python's typing module.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or external data handling.\n- The complex conditional definitions are typical for maintaining backward compatibility.\n- No network calls, data exfiltration, or runtime code execution involving untrusted inputs are present.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The risk scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at 0; the code is transparent but complex due to compatibility handling.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately high.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of the typing module, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
