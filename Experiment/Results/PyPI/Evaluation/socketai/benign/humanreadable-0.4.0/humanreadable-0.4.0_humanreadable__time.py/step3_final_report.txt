  "reasoning": "The code is a straightforward utility for parsing and formatting time durations, relying on regex and data classes. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The minor security concern stems from parsing untrusted input via regex, which is standard practice and does not constitute a vulnerability. All reviewed reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0, with a low security risk score of approximately 0.1, justified by the input parsing but no actual security flaw. Therefore, the overall assessment is consistent and accurate.",
