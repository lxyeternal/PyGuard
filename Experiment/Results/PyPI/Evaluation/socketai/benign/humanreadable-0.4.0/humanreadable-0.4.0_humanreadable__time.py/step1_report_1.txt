{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for parsing, converting, and formatting time duration strings with various units.",
  "sources": "Reads input from constructor arguments ('readable_value') in __init__ and _parse functions, as well as regular expression searches within __init__ and _parse.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly performs data parsing and formatting without external communication or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input string -> re.findall extracts time components -> Time class constructor parses and assigns values -> methods perform conversions and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for time parsing; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns. The use of regex and data classes is typical. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured approach to parsing time duration strings with multiple units, using regular expressions and data classes. It normalizes and converts time units, provides comparison and addition operators, and formatting for human-readable output. No external data sources, network operations, or insecure coding practices are identified. The code relies on standard Python modules and straightforward logic. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a secure, well-structured implementation for handling time durations. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the analyzed content.",
