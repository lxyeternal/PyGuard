  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for a Python module or package, including author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "None. No data is being written to external systems, files, or network locations.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; only static string assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features detected; standard metadata definitions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments used for module metadata. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks where data is transmitted or stored insecurely, and no flows involving user input or external data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident. The code is typical for open-source Python projects to include author and license info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard package information declarations.",
