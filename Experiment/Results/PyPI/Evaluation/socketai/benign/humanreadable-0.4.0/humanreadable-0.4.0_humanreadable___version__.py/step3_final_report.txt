  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals to module-level variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static metadata with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources are present. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose. The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
