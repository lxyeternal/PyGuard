{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata attributes for a Python module or package, such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the assignment statements that set string values to module-level variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems. No data processing or I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only contains static attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely metadata with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials beyond author and email, which are typical in package metadata. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard module metadata variable assignments containing author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email information. There are no code execution, data manipulation, network operations, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code only includes metadata attributes related to the package/module author and license information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is standard and safe.",
