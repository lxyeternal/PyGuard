  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is purely static variable assignments for package metadata (__author__, __copyright__, etc.).  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues, malicious code, or obfuscation are present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and contains no external interactions or malicious patterns. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, straightforward assignments.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.  \n   - **SecurityRisk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.  \n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Any High Risk Scores (>0.5)**:  \n   Since all reports assign 0 to malware and security risk, and the code is straightforward metadata, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The code contains no malicious behavior, so malware should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on straightforward static analysis. No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the code is transparent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correctly assigned; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correctly assigned; code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correctly assigned; no security risk present)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is purely metadata declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores. No adjustments needed.",
