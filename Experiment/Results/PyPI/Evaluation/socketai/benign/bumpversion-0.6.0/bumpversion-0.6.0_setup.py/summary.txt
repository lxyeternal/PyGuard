  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the file reading method, which is benign but unconventional. Scores should remain: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting a very low security concern due to file handling but no malicious activity."
