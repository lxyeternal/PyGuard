  "sinks": "No untrusted data flow or data leaks; static data used.",
  "flows": "Reading file in binary mode -> converting to string with str() -> regex substitution -> used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Reading a text file in binary mode and converting to string with str() without explicit decoding; unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks. It reads a README file in binary mode and converts it directly to a string, which results in a string like \"b'...'\", potentially causing formatting issues but not security risks. The regex cleans up references and does not involve untrusted input or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. Minor handling issue noted but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the file reading method, which is benign but unconventional. Scores should remain: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting a very low security concern due to file handling but no malicious activity.",
