{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'fixedint' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description, importing setup functions, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Read README file -> Build long_description string -> Call setup() with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected. No dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable. It reads a README file to build a long description for the package. The setup() function is called with static metadata, including package name, version, author info, classifiers, and package data. All operations are straightforward, typical for Python package setup scripts, with no dynamic or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
