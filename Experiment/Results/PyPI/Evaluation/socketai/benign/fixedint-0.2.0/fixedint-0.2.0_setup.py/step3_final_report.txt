{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script that reads a README file for description and calls setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Reading file -> storing description -> setup() call with static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file reading and static setup call",
  "analysis": "The code performs static operations: conditional import, reading a local README file until a marker, and calling setup() with fixed metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, code injection, network activity, obfuscation, or secrets. The code is typical for packaging a Python library, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected. All signals point to benign, standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All previous reports correctly assessed this, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. No adjustments are necessary.",
