{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'fixedint'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description; imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils; defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network, file, or environment variable usage that could lead to data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file content, then passes metadata to setup function without any data manipulation or external input during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code reads a local file and sets package metadata straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions conditionally, reads a local README file until a marker, then constructs a long description string. It defines package metadata including name, version, author info, URL, classifiers, description, and package data. All operations are static and standard for Python packaging. There are no suspicious inputs, code injections, or malicious behaviors. No data leakage, network activity, or system commands are present. The script appears to be a benign package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It performs expected actions for package configuration and distribution.",
