  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
    "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
    "File handling is straightforward, opening 'README.rst' without validation.",
    "No network activity, system modification, or hidden behaviors."

  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that imports setup(), reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. It uses simple file I/O and static data, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
