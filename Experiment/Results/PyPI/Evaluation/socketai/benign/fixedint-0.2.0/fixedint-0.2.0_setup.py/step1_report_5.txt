{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'fixedint'. Its purpose is to define package metadata and installation instructions for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file ('README.rst') to extract long description content; no external data inputs or untrusted sources are used in the setup process.",
  "sinks": "The setup function does not write or transmit data; it primarily defines package metadata. No sinks are evident where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a local README file, processing its contents, and passing static metadata to the setup() function. No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections. The file handling is straightforward, and the setup metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable. It reads the README file line by line until a specific marker, then constructs a long description. The setup() function is called with static, well-known package metadata. No external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. Overall, the script is a typical setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files and defines package metadata without any suspicious code or data flow.",
