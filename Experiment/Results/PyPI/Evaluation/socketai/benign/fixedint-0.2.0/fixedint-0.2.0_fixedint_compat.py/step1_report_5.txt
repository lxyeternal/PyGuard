  "purpose": "Utility code for handling Python version compatibility and creating classes with metaclasses.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; accessing sys.version_info; defining add_metaclass function and its internal logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; no external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info used to determine Python version; add_metaclass processes class dictionaries to create classes with metaclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code performs standard compatibility and metaclass handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module to check Python version, which is typical for compatibility purposes. It defines add_metaclass, a common pattern from six.py for creating classes with metaclasses in a compatible way across Python versions. The function manipulates class dictionaries to remove special attributes and slots, then creates a new class with the specified metaclass. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated code features are present. The code does not include any network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for Python compatibility and metaclass creation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
