{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for Python 2/3 compatibility, specifically for adding metaclasses to classes in a way that works across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.version_info attribute to determine Python version; it also accesses class dictionaries (__dict__) to manipulate class attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks; the code only manipulates internal class attributes and system version info.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info to decide version compatibility, then processes class dictionaries to add metaclasses, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code follows standard practices for cross-version compatibility and class manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and checks Python version info. It defines a decorator 'add_metaclass' that creates a class with a specified metaclass by modifying the class's __dict__ and __slots__. The function uses standard Python features and well-understood patterns for metaclass assignment across different Python versions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code performs standard compatibility and class modification operations without side effects or external data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for Python 2/3 compatibility and class manipulation. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. There are no suspicious or harmful behaviors detected.",
