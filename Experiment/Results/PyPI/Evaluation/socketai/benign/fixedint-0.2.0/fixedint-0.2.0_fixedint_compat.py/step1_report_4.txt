  "purpose": "Utility code to add a metaclass to a class via decorator, compatible with Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and defines add_metaclass function, which accesses class attributes and manipulates __dict__ and __slots__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or external system calls.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code primarily modifies class definitions during class creation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses common compatibility pattern; no suspicious or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version, defines a decorator to add metaclasses, and manipulates class dictionaries and slots. It operates during class decoration, which is a standard pattern. No indications of malicious intent or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a typical utility for class creation compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for adding metaclasses with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
