{
  "purpose": "Provide a decorator function for adding a metaclass to a class in a backward-compatible way, utilizing code from six.py.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'sys' module, specifically sys.version_info, and from class __dict__ during the decorator operation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output channels are evident. The code only manipulates class attributes and system version info.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is read at the start; the add_metaclass function accesses class __dict__ and modifies it before creating a new class object with the specified metaclass.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated logic, and no external network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for compatibility purposes, ensuring a class can be assigned a metaclass in a way compatible across Python versions. It safely manipulates class __dict__ for metaclass creation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function copied from 'six.py' for compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
