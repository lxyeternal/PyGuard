{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for Python 2/3 compatibility, specifically for adding a metaclass to a class via a decorator.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check, no external input sources",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or harmful actions are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly manipulates class creation and attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; use of standard library functions and patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check Python version, defines a utility function 'add_metaclass' that creates a class decorator to assign a metaclass to a class. It manipulates class dictionaries to remove special attributes and applies the metaclass. All operations are standard and do not involve any network, file, or system modifications. No obfuscation, no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility for managing metaclasses compatibly across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
