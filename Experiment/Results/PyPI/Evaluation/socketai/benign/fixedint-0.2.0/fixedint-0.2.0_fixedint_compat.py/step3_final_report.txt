  "purpose": "Utility function to add a metaclass to a class in a way compatible with Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check, class __dict__ for manipulating class attributes, __slots__ for slot handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> add_metaclass decorator -> class __dict__ and __slots__ manipulation -> class creation with metaclass.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows a standard pattern from six.py for cross-version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version, manipulates class dictionaries and slots to assign a metaclass, following a well-known pattern. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign utility function used for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility pattern for Python 2/3 compatibility, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
