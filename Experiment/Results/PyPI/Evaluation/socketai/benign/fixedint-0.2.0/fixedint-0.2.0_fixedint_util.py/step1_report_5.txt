{
  "purpose": "The class provides a custom string representation for objects, formatting integers as hexadecimal strings with specific width calculation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the object's integer value via 'int(self)' and accesses 'self.width'.",
  "sinks": "The '%0*x' string formatting may process the integer for output, but no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input source: 'int(self)' and 'self.width'; Output sink: formatted string returned by __str__ method.",
  "anomalies": "The code assumes 'self' can be converted to an integer and that 'self.width' exists; no explicit checks or error handling are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a __str__ method that converts the object to an integer and uses its 'width' attribute for formatting a hexadecimal string. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and appears to be intended for formatting objects in hexadecimal. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is detected. The logic is simple and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless formatting mixin intended to produce hex representations of objects. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
