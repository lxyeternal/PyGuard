{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that imports components from the 'fixedint' package and defines a function to run internal tests of the 'fixedint' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fixedint.base', 'fixedint.aliases', and dynamic import of 'test_fixedint' within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only calls a test function from a trusted library.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, then within the test() function dynamically imports 'test_fixedint' and calls its run() method with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Slightly unusual dynamic import inside the function, but common in testing contexts; no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test harness for the 'fixedint' library, with no external input, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk due to executing trusted test code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as a test utility support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test script for the 'fixedint' library with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
