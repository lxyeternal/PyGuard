{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates and exports classes based on the FixedInt class with different configurations for bit size, signedness, and mutability.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures: lists of integers and boolean values, used in loops for class generation.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns class objects to the global namespace and appends class names to __all__, which are standard Python operations with no untrusted data sink involved.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources; the code constructs classes based on predefined static data and exposes them globally.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically generates class objects and modifies their __module__ attribute; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'FixedInt' from a package 'fixedint' and creates multiple subclasses with different configurations by looping over specified parameters. It then sets the __module__ attribute of each class and updates the __all__ list for module exports. This process appears to be a straightforward dynamic class generation pattern commonly used for defining multiple variants of a data type. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not process user input or perform any network operations, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dynamic class generator that exports multiple configurations of FixedInt classes. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is standard and straightforward.",
