{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports and creates multiple classes from the 'fixedint' library, setting their module attribute and adding their names to the __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a fixed list of integers [8, 16, 32, 64] and boolean flags for signed and mutable options.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns class objects to the global namespace using dynamic class creation and modifies their __module__ attribute.",
  "flows": "From predefined lists (sources), classes are instantiated with specific parameters, then assigned to globals, exposing class names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code's purpose is straightforward class creation and export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from 'fixedint', then iterates over combinations of bit sizes and boolean flags to generate multiple class objects. These classes are assigned to the global namespace and their __module__ attribute is set dynamically. This pattern is typical for metaprogramming or dynamic class generation, with no signs of malicious intent. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or suspicious code injections. The code appears to be designed for generating multiple fixed integer types for use elsewhere. All operations are contained within standard Python class creation and namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign dynamic class generator for fixed integer types, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It employs standard dynamic class creation techniques without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
