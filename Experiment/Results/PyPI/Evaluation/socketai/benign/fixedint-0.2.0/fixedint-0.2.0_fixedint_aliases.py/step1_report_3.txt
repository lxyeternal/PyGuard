  "purpose": "Dynamically creates multiple subclasses of FixedInt with different configurations and adds their names to the module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'fixedint' module; iteration over lists to generate class instances.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __module__ attribute; dynamic addition to globals() and __all__ list.",
  "flows": "Import of 'fixedint' -> creation of FixedInt subclasses -> modification of __module__ attribute -> registration in globals() and __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation and modification of __module__ attribute; no explicit data input or output; no hardcoded secrets or external network activity. The code’s purpose appears solely to generate and expose classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'fixedint' and then creates multiple classes based on 'FixedInt' with various sizes, sign options, and mutability. It assigns each class to the global namespace and updates the __all__ list accordingly. The modification of __module__ may be intended for clarity or namespace control but does not pose an immediate security risk. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a utility to generate class variants dynamically, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dynamic class generator that creates various subclasses of FixedInt. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It’s a benign utility script that could be used in a larger project for defining multiple fixed integer types.",
