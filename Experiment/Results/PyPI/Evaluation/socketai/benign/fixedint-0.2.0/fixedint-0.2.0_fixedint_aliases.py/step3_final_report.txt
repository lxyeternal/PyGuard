{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically generates multiple subclasses of FixedInt with various configurations, assigns their __module__, and adds them to __all__ and the global namespace.",
  "sources": "Static iteration over predefined lists; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class __module__, addition to __all__, and globals() dictionary.",
  "flows": "Class creation -> setting __module__ -> updating __all__ and globals()",
  "anomalies": "Modification of __module__ attribute; no external data or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward dynamic class creation based on static data, with no external inputs, network activity, or secrets. The modification of __module__ is unusual but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The pattern is typical for metaprogramming and does not pose security risks. The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. The slight elevation in risk score (0.1) reflects the dynamic class creation and namespace modification but does not indicate actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current low scores are appropriate; a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal risk score of 0.0 better reflect the lack of security concerns.",
