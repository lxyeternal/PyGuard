{
  "purpose": "Dynamically creates and exposes classes based on the FixedInt class with different configurations for bit width, signedness, and mutability.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded lists [8,16,32,64], [True, False], and the imported FixedInt class.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns to the global namespace and modifies class __module__ attributes, but no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from fixed lists flow into class instantiation, then into namespace assignment and __module__ modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports FixedInt, then iterates over predefined configurations to generate multiple class objects. Each class is assigned a new __module__ attribute and added to __all__ for export. This dynamic class creation and namespace modification are standard practices in metaprogramming, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. There are no external inputs, no network operations, and no code execution outside of class creation. The code appears to be intended for defining multiple fixed-size integer classes with different properties.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metaprogramming pattern for class generation and export. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
