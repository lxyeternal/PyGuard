  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward code.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0. No issues detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is safe. The external `mjml_render` function is assumed trusted. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, but with a slightly higher securityRisk (0.2).  \n- **Analysis:** The concern hinges on `mjml_render`'s internal behavior, which isn't shown.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware remains 0; the securityRisk is cautious but not elevated.  \n- **Assessment:** Given no evidence of malicious activity, the scores seem reasonable. No change recommended.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a high confidence level (0.9).  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, external function is trusted.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern, external `mjml_render`, no malicious signs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar, standard implementation, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, matching the clear code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the external dependency on `mjml_render`.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The external `mjml_render` function is a critical point. Its security implications depend on its implementation. If it executes system commands or processes untrusted input insecurely, the overall risk could be higher. However, based solely on this code, no malicious activity is evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, dependent on external function security)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent. The security posture hinges on the external `mjml_render` implementation, which should be reviewed separately. The current scoring reflects this appropriately.",
