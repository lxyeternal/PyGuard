  "purpose": "Define a custom Django template tag to render MJML templates using an external rendering function.",
  "sources": "The 'mjml' tag reads the template content within its block via 'nodelist.render(context)'.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'nodelist.render' (MJML source) is passed to 'mjml_render', which may process or transform it.",
  "flows": "Template block content -> nodelist.render -> mjml_render -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior detected. Usage of external 'mjml_render' function is standard if trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django template tag 'mjml' that captures its inner content and renders it using the provided 'mjml_render' function. There are no input sources that originate outside the trusted template context besides the template content itself. The flow is straightforward: template block content is rendered to a string and passed to an external function. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The external 'mjml_render' could be a point of concern if it internally executes untrusted code, but that is outside the scope of this code review, as it is assumed to be a trusted rendering utility. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution is evident. Overall, the code acts as a simple template tag wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django template tag implementation for MJML rendering with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external rendering function, which should be reviewed separately for safety, but this module itself is safe.",
