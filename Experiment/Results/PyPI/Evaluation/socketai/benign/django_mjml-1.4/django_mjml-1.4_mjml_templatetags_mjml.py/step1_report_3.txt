{
  "purpose": "To define a custom Django template tag that renders MJML templates into HTML using the mjml_render function.",
  "sources": "The nodelist.render(context) call, which retrieves the template content within the {% mjml %}...{% endmjml %} block.",
  "sinks": "The mjml_render function, which processes the MJML source. If mjml_render executes system commands or processes untrusted input insecurely, it could be a potential sink.",
  "flows": "User input in the template is rendered via nodelist.render(context) and passed directly to mjml_render.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no external network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django template tag 'mjml' that captures the inner content of the tag and renders it using the mjml_render function. The nodelist is obtained through parser.parse and then rendered with the provided context. The core security consideration is the mjml_render function, which is imported from an external module. If mjml_render securely processes MJML without executing system commands or handling untrusted input insecurely, then the code itself is safe. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or malicious behaviors. The template tag usage appears standard and safe, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django template tag implementation for rendering MJML templates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment. The security depends on the implementation of mjml_render, which appears to be a trusted external utility. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose security threats.",
