{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django template tag to render MJML templates within Django templates.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the template node content, which may contain MJML code provided by template authors.",
  "sinks": "The `mjml_render` function is called with the MJML source; if this function executes external commands or processes untrusted input without sanitization, it could be a sink.",
  "flows": "Template MJML content (source) flows into `mjml_render` via `mjml_source`, which is derived from the template's nodelist content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The `mjml_render` function's implementation is external; its security depends on its internal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Django custom tag that captures MJML code within a template, then processes it using an external `mjml_render` function. It does not perform any unsafe operations or include suspicious code patterns. The security concern hinges on the behavior of `mjml_render`. If `mjml_render` safely processes the MJML input, then this code is secure. If `mjml_render` executes system commands or handles untrusted input insecurely, potential risks could arise. However, based solely on this code, no malicious or insecure behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom Django template tag with no obvious malicious intent. Its security depends on the implementation of `mjml_render`, which is external. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity within this snippet.",
