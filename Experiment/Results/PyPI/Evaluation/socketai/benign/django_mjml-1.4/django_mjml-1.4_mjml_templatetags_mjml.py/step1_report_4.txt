  "purpose": "Define a custom Django template tag to render MJML templates by processing template content and converting it via the mjml_render function.",
  "sources": "The code reads template content via nodelist.render(context) which sources data from the Django template rendering context.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to mjml_render(mjml_source), which processes the MJML code. This function's implementation is external, but it likely transforms MJML into HTML.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the template content (mjml_source) through the mjml_render function, producing rendered output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard Django template mechanisms and external library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django custom template tag that takes MJML code within a template block, renders it as a string, and then calls an external rendering function. There are no signs of malicious data handling, obfuscation, or malicious code. The mjml_render function's implementation is external and not provided, so its safety depends on that external code, but from this snippet, the code itself appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django template tag implementation for rendering MJML templates. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues within this code snippet. It relies on an external rendering function, which should be verified separately, but the code as provided appears safe.",
