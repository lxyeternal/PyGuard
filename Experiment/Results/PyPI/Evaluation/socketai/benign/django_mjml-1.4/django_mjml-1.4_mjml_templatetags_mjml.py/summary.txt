  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of 'mjml_render', which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) is appropriate and justified."
