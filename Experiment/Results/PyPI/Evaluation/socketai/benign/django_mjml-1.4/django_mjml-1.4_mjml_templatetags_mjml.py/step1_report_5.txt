{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django template tag to render MJML templates dynamically within Django templates.",
  "sources": "The code reads template content within the 'mjml' tag and the token split contents.",
  "sinks": "The 'mjml_render' function, which is imported from 'mjml.tools', is used as a sink, passing the MJML source for rendering.",
  "flows": "Input MJML code from the template is read by 'self.nodelist.render', then passed to 'mjml_render' for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code follows standard Django custom tag practices. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django template tag 'mjml' that collects inner template content and renders it through 'mjml_render'. It includes proper parsing and syntax checking. The call to 'mjml_render' could be a potential point of concern depending on its implementation, but within this code, no malicious behavior or malicious data flow is apparent. The code structure appears straightforward, adhering to Django's templating standards, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a custom Django template tag for MJML rendering. No malicious activity or security risks are detected based solely on this code segment.",
