{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django custom template tag 'mjml' that captures inner MJML template content, renders it as a string, and passes it to an external 'mjml_render' function for processing.",
  "sources": "The template content within the 'mjml' tag captured by 'nodelist.render(context)'.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'mjml_render', which receives the MJML source string for processing.",
  "flows": "Template content -> 'nodelist.render()' -> 'mjml_render()' -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django custom template tag implementation that captures its inner content and processes it via an external rendering function. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws within this snippet. The security implications depend on the behavior of 'mjml_render', which is external and not provided. If 'mjml_render' executes system commands or handles untrusted input insecurely, risks could exist, but this cannot be determined from the code alone. The code itself is safe, and the data flow is simple and controlled. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of 'mjml_render', which should be reviewed separately. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) is appropriate and justified.",
