  "purpose": "The script defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'django-mjml', including metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion details.",

    "os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'README.rst')",

  "flows": [
    "Reads version from mjml.__version__",
    "Reads README content from filesystem",
    "Uses find_packages to determine included packages",
    "Installs specified dependencies"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of open() to read README file without error handling (potentially dangerous if file missing or inaccessible)"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure packaging details. It dynamically reads the package version from the 'mjml' module and reads the README file contents for long description. No user input, untrusted data, or network operations are present. The use of open() is straightforward and safe in context; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply manages package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
