  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the django-mjml package using setuptools, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading version from mjml module, reading README.rst file for long_description.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or data sinks present; no data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reading version and long_description during setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard setup procedures with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script configuring package installation. It imports necessary modules, reads version information from the mjml module, and reads the README file for long_description. All operations are typical for Python packaging. No untrusted inputs, no external data flows, and no suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
