{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'django-mjml' Python package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from mjml.__version__, reading README.rst file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file writing (besides reading), or external system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Version and description data flow from package and file reads into setup configuration; no external untrusted data flows or commands executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Use of open() for README content is standard; no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local package 'mjml'. It reads version info and README content, then calls setup() with a detailed configuration. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code adheres to standard setup practices without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a straightforward configuration file with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
