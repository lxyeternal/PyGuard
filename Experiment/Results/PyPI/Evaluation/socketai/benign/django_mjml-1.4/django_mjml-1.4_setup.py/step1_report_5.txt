{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python Django application that uses MJML templates.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the mjml module, reads the README file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to untrusted sources or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Version info from mjml.__version__ and README content to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup() from setuptools with typical parameters for a Python package. It imports 'os' for file path handling, 'setuptools' for packaging, and 'mjml' to obtain version info. There are no dynamic code executions, no network communications, and no embedded credentials or obfuscated code. The code appears to be straightforward packaging boilerplate. It does not perform any input validation, external data processing, or malicious activity. All data sources are static and well-defined, with no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without executing any harmful operations.",
