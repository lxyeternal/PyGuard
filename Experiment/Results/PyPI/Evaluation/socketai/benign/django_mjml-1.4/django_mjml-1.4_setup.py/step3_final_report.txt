  "purpose": "Package configuration for 'django-mjml' including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'mjml' module; reading README file; importing setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data flows or network operations.",
  "flows": "Importing version from 'mjml'; reading README via open() without error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling; standard setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports version info from 'mjml', reads a README file, and configures package metadata and dependencies using setuptools. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The only minor concern is the use of open() without error handling, which is common in setup scripts but not a security risk. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
