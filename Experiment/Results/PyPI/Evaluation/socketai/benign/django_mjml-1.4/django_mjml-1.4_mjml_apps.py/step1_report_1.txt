{
  "purpose": "This code configures and verifies the MJML rendering setup within a Django application, ensuring MJML is installed and functioning correctly.",
  "sources": "mjml_render function calls, reading MJML template strings, configuration settings from mjml_settings",
  "sinks": "Potential exceptions raised (ImproperlyConfigured), which may impact application startup or behavior",
  "flows": "MJML template strings are passed to mjml_render; if errors occur, exceptions are raised; the check_mjml_command function verifies MJML command output correctness; the ready method triggers this check based on configuration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily performs validation and configuration checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a validation function check_mjml_command that renders sample MJML templates using the mjml_render function. It catches runtime errors to determine if MJML is correctly installed and functioning. The AppConfig class triggers this check during Django startup if configured to do so. The template strings are static and safe. There are no signs of malicious data handling, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. Exception handling is standard for configuration validation, not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious network calls, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration validation script for ensuring MJML is correctly installed and operational in a Django environment. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
