{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to verify the correct installation and functionality of the MJML command-line tool within a Django application, ensuring that MJML renders correctly and that the environment is properly configured.",
  "sources": "Reads MJML rendering functions and configuration settings from django and mjml modules, specifically mjml_render and mjml_settings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to potential leaks or malicious actions; the code primarily checks for correct MJML rendering output.",
  "flows": "The code calls mjml_render with hardcoded MJML strings, then evaluates the output to confirm correctness, and raises exceptions if the expected HTML is not returned or an error occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard exception handling. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to verify the functionality of the MJML rendering tool by executing sample MJML snippets and validating the output. It handles exceptions gracefully, raising configuration errors if MJML is misconfigured or returns unexpected results. No untrusted input processing, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical configuration validation patterns. There are no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate environment check for MJML rendering in a Django context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply validates that MJML is installed correctly and operational, which is essential for the application's rendering pipeline.",
