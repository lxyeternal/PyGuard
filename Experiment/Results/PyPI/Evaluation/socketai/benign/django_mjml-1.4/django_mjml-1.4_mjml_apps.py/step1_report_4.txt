{
  "purpose": "This code checks the MJML rendering command-line tool's functionality within a Django application to ensure correct installation and operation.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings from 'mjml.settings' and performs MJML rendering via 'mjml.tools.mjml_render'. It also handles exceptions raised during rendering.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted user input or data that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration settings, then conditionally calls 'mjml_render' to test the MJML command-line tool, handling exceptions to verify functionality.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The exception handling is standard for verifying external command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies MJML installation by rendering static MJML templates and catching errors. It raises configuration errors if rendering fails or produces unexpected results. No untrusted input is processed, and no external data flows from untrusted sources. The logic is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or suspicious code elements. It primarily performs a feature check during Django app startup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration validation for an external rendering tool within a Django app. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code does not process user input or perform any unsafe operations.",
