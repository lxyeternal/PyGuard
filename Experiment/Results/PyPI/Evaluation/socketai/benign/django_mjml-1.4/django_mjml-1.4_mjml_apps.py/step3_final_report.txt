{
  "purpose": "The code performs a configuration validation for the MJML rendering environment in a Django application by executing static MJML snippets and checking the output to ensure MJML is installed and functioning correctly.",
  "sources": "The static MJML strings within the mjml_render function calls used for environment validation.",
  "sinks": "The external command invoked by mjml_render, which executes MJML rendering, but only with static, controlled input strings.",
  "flows": "Static MJML strings are passed to mjml_render, which internally calls external commands; no untrusted data flows into these commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or processing of untrusted input; exception handling is standard for configuration checks.",
  "analysis": "The code executes static MJML snippets via mjml_render to verify MJML installation. It handles exceptions to catch rendering failures and raises configuration errors if output is invalid. There is no user input or untrusted data involved. The external command execution is controlled with fixed strings, minimizing security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code's purpose is solely environment validation, and it employs straightforward, clear logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment validation routine with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates solely on static data, with proper error handling, and does not process untrusted input. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk are appropriate. The code is safe for use, and the existing scores are justified.",
