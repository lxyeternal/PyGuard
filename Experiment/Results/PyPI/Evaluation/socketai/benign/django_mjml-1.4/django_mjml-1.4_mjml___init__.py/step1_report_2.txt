  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Django application, specifying version and default app config based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'django' module, reading 'django.VERSION', and the string assignment for '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import of 'django' -> reading 'django.VERSION' -> conditional assignment to 'default_app_config'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django, checks its version, and conditionally sets a configuration variable. The version check ensures compatibility. There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, and no data leaks. The logic is straightforward and typical for Django setup scripts. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django configuration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version-based configuration setup without any suspicious actions.",
