  "purpose": "Set the default app configuration for a Django package based on the Django version.",
  "sources": "Reading the django.VERSION variable to determine the Django version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "The version check influences the assignment of default_app_config, but only within the context of configuration logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The version check is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports django and defines a version string. It then checks if the Django version is less than 3.2 and, if so, assigns a string to default_app_config. This is a typical compatibility pattern for Django apps. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or suspicious operations. No external data is read from untrusted sources; the code only inspects a module variable and assigns a value accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility snippet for a Django package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
