  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets: importing Django, defining a version string, and conditionally setting `default_app_config` based on `django.VERSION`.\n- No report indicates any dynamic data handling, external data sources, or user input.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns.\n- The logic is straightforward, typical for Django compatibility code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's actual content:\nThe code provided:\n```python\nimport django\n\n__version__ = '1.4'\n\nif django.VERSION < (3, 2):\n    default_app_config = 'mjml.apps.MJMLConfig'\n```\n- No malicious or suspicious operations are present.\n- No data flows, external communication, or data processing.\n- The version check is a standard pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and performs a compatibility check.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no anomalies.\n- The reasoning is sound; they correctly identify the code as standard configuration logic.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are accurately described.\n- The confidence scores (1) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The `__version__` variable is defined but not used elsewhere. This is harmless but could be redundant; however, it does not introduce security issues.\n- The `default_app_config` is assigned only if the Django version is less than 3.2, which is a typical pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Regarding the scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Is there any hidden malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward configuration logic.\n\n- **Are there any vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. No data leaks, injections, or insecure operations.\n\n- **Are the reports accurate?**  \n  Yes. They correctly interpret the code.\n\n- **Are the scores justified?**  \n  Yes, all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard Django compatibility snippet with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No further action needed.",
