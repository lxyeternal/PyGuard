  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "django.VERSION is compared to a tuple to determine configuration setting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The version string is hardcoded but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django, defines a version variable, and conditionally sets a default app configuration for older Django versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended for version compatibility setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign version compatibility check and configuration assignment for a Django app. No malicious behavior detected.",
