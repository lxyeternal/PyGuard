  "purpose": "Django version compatibility configuration setting based on django.VERSION.",
  "sources": "django.VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to default_app_config (indirectly affecting Django app behavior).",
  "flows": "django.VERSION is read, then compared; if condition is true, default_app_config is set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Django apps.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django, defines a version string, and conditionally sets default_app_config based on django.VERSION. It performs a simple version check without external data, dynamic code execution, or data handling. The logic is typical for maintaining compatibility across Django versions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code is clear and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard Django compatibility snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified.",
