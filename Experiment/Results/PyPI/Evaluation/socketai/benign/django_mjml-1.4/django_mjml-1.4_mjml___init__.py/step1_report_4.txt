  "purpose": "This code configures a Django app with version-specific settings.",
  "sources": "django.VERSION attribute and hardcoded __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django framework, defines a version string, and conditionally sets a configuration variable based on the Django version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of version comparison and static strings is typical for configuration files. No obfuscated code, malicious side-effects, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version-dependent configuration for a Django app. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
