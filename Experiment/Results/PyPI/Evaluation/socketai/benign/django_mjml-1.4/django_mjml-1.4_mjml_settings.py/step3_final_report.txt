  "purpose": "Configuration validation for MJML backend modes in a Django application, ensuring correct data types and values.",
  "sources": "Settings retrieved via getattr, including MJML_BACKEND_MODE, MJML_EXEC_CMD, MJML_TCPSERVERS, MJML_HTTPSERVERS",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Settings are read and validated; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for validation, which could be disabled in production, potentially leading to misconfigurations; presence of URLs and credentials in configuration data, but not actively used in code execution",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward configuration loading and validation using assertions. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or active security vulnerabilities are present. Assertions serve as validation but are not security mechanisms; disabling them could lead to unnoticed misconfigurations. The URLs and credentials are static configuration parameters, not active code or data leaks. No untrusted input is processed at runtime. The malware score is correctly zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal risk primarily due to configuration control. Overall, the code is safe and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration validation snippet with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
