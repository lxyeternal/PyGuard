  "purpose": "Configure backend settings for MJML rendering in a Django application, supporting multiple backend modes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from Django settings, including 'MJML_BACKEND_MODE', 'MJML_EXEC_CMD', 'MJML_TCPSERVERS', and 'MJML_HTTPSERVERS'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially uses untrusted data in URLs and authentication info within HTTP configurations, but no direct sink is evident in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from settings, validated, and stored in variables for later use. No direct data flow to external systems is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets besides default values, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configuration data with defaults and performs type and value assertions to validate formats. It handles multiple modes for backend rendering, ensuring inputs are of expected types and formats. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of assert statements for validation is standard. The only potential concern is the presence of URLs and authentication info, but these are configuration parameters, not active code. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration loader and validator for MJML rendering backends within a Django app. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The validation steps mitigate misconfiguration risks but do not introduce security concerns.",
