  "purpose": "Configure MJML backend mode settings for a Django application, including command-line, TCP server, and HTTP server options.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration values from Django settings, including MJML_BACKEND_MODE, MJML_EXEC_CMD, MJML_CHECK_CMD_ON_STARTUP, MJML_TCPSERVERS, and MJML_HTTPSERVERS.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure usage of URLs and authentication credentials in HTTP server configurations, which could be exploited if malicious data is injected or if sensitive data is hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from Django settings, validated, and stored in variables; no untrusted input directly influences security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden backdoors are present. All assertions validate configuration data types and structures. No hardcoded credentials are evident; 'HTTP_AUTH' defaults to None or strings, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves configuration settings for different MJML backend modes. It performs type and structure validations to ensure data integrity. No untrusted input sources are involved, and no code executes dynamically or maliciously. Assertions prevent misconfiguration but do not introduce security issues. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for managing MJML rendering modes in a Django project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs proper validation of input data from settings, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
