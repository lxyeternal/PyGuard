  "purpose": "Configuration setup for different MJML backend modes (cmd, tcpserver, httpserver) within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads settings from Django's settings module, including 'MJML_BACKEND_MODE', 'MJML_EXEC_CMD', 'MJML_TCPSERVERS', 'MJML_HTTPSERVERS', and their related sub-settings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted directly within this code. Potential indirect sinks could involve network requests or command execution if misused, but not within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration values based on the backend mode, with assertions ensuring proper data types and value constraints. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs validation on configuration data, but the use of 'assert' statements for configuration validation could be problematic if assertions are disabled in production. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior is detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs configuration validation for various backend modes, ensuring correct types and values. It uses assertions to enforce constraints, which could be a risk if assertions are disabled (e.g., in optimized Python runs). No external or untrusted input is processed at runtime; settings are assumed to be controlled. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signs are evident. The code appears to be a standard configuration validation pattern with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration validation segment for MJML backend modes in a Django project. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The use of assertions for validation is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose supply chain security risks.",
