{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for rendering MJML templates using different backend methods (command line, TCP server, HTTP server).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'mjml_settings' and environment variables; accepts 'mjml_code' input as a string parameter in rendering functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute external commands, socket connections for TCP communication, and HTTP requests for remote server interaction. Data is sent over network sockets and HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Input 'mjml_code' flows into subprocess stdin or network sockets/HTTP requests depending on the backend mode. The code then processes responses and may raise errors based on network or process outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; usage of subprocess with shell execution is safe as no shell=True; socket connections include TCP_NODELAY and timeout settings. No obfuscated code detected; no unusual or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages external process invocation and network communication for MJML rendering. It uses caching for command arguments and handles exceptions properly. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed. The network communications use standard practices, with timeouts and error handling. No data leakage or privacy violations are evident. The code performs expected tasks of rendering templates via various methods, with appropriate error handling and resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate and intended for rendering MJML templates using external processes or network services. It does not contain malicious behavior or malicious code. No security vulnerabilities or supply chain attacks are apparent from this analysis.",
