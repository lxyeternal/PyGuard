{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to render MJML templates into HTML using different backends: command-line, TCP server, or HTTP server.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'mjml_code' strings passed to rendering functions, environment variables for command args and server configurations, and socket data streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess.Popen (executes external command), socket.sendall (network transmission), and HTTP requests (sending data over network).",
  "flows": "Input 'mjml_code' flows into command execution or network transmission functions, with data sent to subprocess or remote servers; responses are read back and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secret tokens present; code appears to handle errors gracefully. Use of 'force_bytes' and dynamic server selection could obscure data flow but are typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages subprocess invocation with error handling, uses socket and HTTP communication with appropriate timeouts, and performs data encoding/decoding. No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior, are evident. It utilizes external libraries (requests, django utilities) appropriately. The network interactions are limited to rendering MJML via trusted endpoints, with error handling and server fallback logic. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for rendering MJML templates via external processes or services, with standard error handling and network communication practices. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
