{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to render MJML templates via subprocess, TCP, or HTTP, facilitating email template processing.",
  "sources": "External configuration settings, user-provided mjml_code, socket connections, HTTP POST requests",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution with external command arguments, socket sendall and recv, HTTP response handling",
  "flows": "mjml_code flows into subprocess stdin, socket.sendall, or HTTP request body; responses flow back into the application",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages external interactions, with proper error handling and no evident malicious payloads. It relies on external services and subprocesses, which could be manipulated if environment or configuration is compromised, but no malicious intent or backdoors are present. The use of subprocess, socket, and HTTP for rendering is typical for such applications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are appropriate, considering external dependencies and trust assumptions. Overall, the code is benign, with external trust dependencies being the primary risk factor.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated content. External dependencies and network interactions introduce moderate risk, but no evidence suggests malicious activity. The scores are justified and should remain low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2 to 0.3.",
