No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk score reflects potential resource exhaustion, which is standard for such tools but does not imply malicious intent."

There is no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure download and execution of unverified remote code, which elevates the security risk. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.5 due to the potential for exploitation stemming from insecure practices."

The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious test modules if present, which is a general risk of dynamic module loading based on filesystem state. The code itself is safe and appropriate for trusted environments."
