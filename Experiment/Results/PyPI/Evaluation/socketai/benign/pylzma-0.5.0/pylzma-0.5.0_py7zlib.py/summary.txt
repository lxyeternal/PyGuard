  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a 7-Zip archive reader with support for encryption and multiple compression methods. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk score reflects potential resource exhaustion, which is standard for such tools but does not imply malicious intent."
