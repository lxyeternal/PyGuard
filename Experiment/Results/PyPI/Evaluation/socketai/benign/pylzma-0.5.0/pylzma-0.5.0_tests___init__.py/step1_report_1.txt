{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and runs a unittest test suite by dynamically importing test modules matching 'test_*.py' in the current directory and applying compatibility fixes for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem for test modules via glob(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'test_*.py'))",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules (__import__), execution of suite() method on imported modules",
  "flows": "Filesystem glob -> import modules -> call suite() on each module",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Compatibility shims for old Python versions are benign. No network, data leaks, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages test discovery and execution, using standard library functions. It employs dynamic module importing based on filesystem content but does not execute any untrusted or external data. Compatibility fixes are straightforward. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign test harness that dynamically imports and runs test modules. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
