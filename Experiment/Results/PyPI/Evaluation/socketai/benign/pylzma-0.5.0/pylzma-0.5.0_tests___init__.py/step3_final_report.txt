  "purpose": "A test harness that discovers and runs all 'test_*.py' modules in the current directory, aggregating their test suites for execution.",
  "sources": "Filesystem globbing to locate test modules; dynamic import (__import__) of test modules; calling suite() functions within those modules.",
  "sinks": "Execution of imported test modules via __import__ and suite() calls, which could run malicious code if test files are compromised.",
  "flows": "Filesystem globbing -> dynamic import of test modules -> invocation of suite() in each module -> execution of test cases.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on filesystem content; compatibility patches for older Python versions; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard test discovery by globbing for 'test_*.py' files, then dynamically importing each and invoking their suite() functions to assemble a test suite. Compatibility fixes are benign. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The primary security concern is that if malicious test files are present in the directory, they could execute harmful code during import or suite execution. The code itself is straightforward and benign, with no obfuscation or malware. The dynamic import mechanism is common but can be exploited if untrusted files are introduced. Therefore, the inherent risk depends on the trustworthiness of the filesystem content, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign test runner with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious test modules if present, which is a general risk of dynamic module loading based on filesystem state. The code itself is safe and appropriate for trusted environments.",
