  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and run a suite of unittests, dynamically importing test modules from the filesystem.",
  "sources": "Reads filesystem to find test_*.py files, imports modules based on filenames, and reads system version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Filesystem scan -> dynamic import of modules -> adding tests to suite -> execution of unittest.main()",
  "anomalies": "Compatibility fixes for Python 2.3, dynamic importing of test modules, no explicit security anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs filesystem operations, dynamic module imports, and unittest setup. It ensures compatibility with older Python versions by patching unittest assertions if missing. The module imports test modules based on filename patterns and adds their test suites to a test runner. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification. The dynamic import approach is common in test runners and does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard test suite launcher with compatibility adjustments. It does not exhibit malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
