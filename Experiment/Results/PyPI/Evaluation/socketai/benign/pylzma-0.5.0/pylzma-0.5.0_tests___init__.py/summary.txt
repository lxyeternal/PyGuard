  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign test runner with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential execution of malicious test modules if present, which is a general risk of dynamic module loading based on filesystem state. The code itself is safe and appropriate for trusted environments."
