{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a test suite by dynamically importing test modules matching a pattern and running them using unittest framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to locate test files, imports modules dynamically based on filenames, and accesses module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; mainly involves module imports and attribute access.",
  "flows": "Filesystem globbing -> dynamic import of test modules -> execution of test suites.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes compatibility shims for older Python versions, which is normal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem operations to locate test scripts, dynamically imports modules, and adds their test suites to a unittest TestSuite. Compatibility fixes for Python 2.3 are included, which involve patching unittest assertions if missing. No external network connections, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is standard test setup; no anomalies or suspicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard test runner setup with dynamic module loading and compatibility fixes. No malicious intent, no malware, and no security risks identified.",
