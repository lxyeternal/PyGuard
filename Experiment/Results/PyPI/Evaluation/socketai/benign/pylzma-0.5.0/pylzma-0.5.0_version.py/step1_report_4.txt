{
  "purpose": "This script retrieves the current version of a project, primarily using 'git describe', and falls back to reading from a file if necessary. It automates version management during packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the filesystem (RELEASE-VERSION file) and executes 'git' commands via subprocess to get version info.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'git' command and reads/writes to 'RELEASE-VERSION' file. No network, database, or system modification actions are present.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess call 'git describe' and file reads; Sink: subprocess output and file writes; Flow: version info flows from command/file to the returned value and possibly updates the file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or hidden backdoors. The code interacts with system processes and files as expected for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine project version via 'git describe' and fallback file reading. It includes standard subprocess handling and file I/O without any obfuscation or suspicious logic. No network connections, credential handling, or data exfiltration are present. Exception handling is broad but limited to avoiding crashes, not hiding malicious activity. Overall, functionality is consistent with legitimate versioning scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate version management tasks without any signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on standard subprocess and file operations, with no indications of backdoors or security risks.",
