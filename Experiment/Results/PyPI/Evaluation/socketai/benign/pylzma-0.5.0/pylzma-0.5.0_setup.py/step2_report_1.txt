  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build configuration for pylzma, with no malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The external `get_git_version()` function is not provided but appears to be a version retrieval method.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — seems slightly high for a build script, but given the external dependency and platform-specific compilation, a small risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming the script is a standard setup for building Python extensions, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — reasonable, minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The script sets up build environment, supports multithreading, and compatibility. No suspicious activity or code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard build setup with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup for 'pylzma' package, no suspicious patterns, no external data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — fitting for a build script.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a legitimate build configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to external versioning dependency and platform-specific compilation, but nothing alarming.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, legitimate, and appropriate for its purpose. No further action needed.",
