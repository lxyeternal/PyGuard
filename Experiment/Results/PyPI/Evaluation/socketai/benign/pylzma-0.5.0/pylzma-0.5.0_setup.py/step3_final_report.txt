{
  "purpose": "Build configuration script for pylzma, setting up compilation options, platform detection, and optional features for building the Python extension module.",
  "sources": "External function get_git_version(), platform detection via sys.platform, and inclusion of source files and macros based on configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present; the script primarily sets build parameters.",
  "flows": "Configuration flags and platform detection influence source file inclusion and macro definitions, but no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward. The external get_git_version() function is not provided but appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension module, with platform-specific configurations, optional multithreading support, and versioning. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The external version function is typical and not suspicious. The build flags and source file inclusions are standard for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, safe build configuration for pylzma with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2). It is appropriate for use in production environments.",
