  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious indicators, consistency of scores, and any anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a setup/build configuration for a Python extension module, with no suspicious or malicious code. It uses external functions like `get_git_version()` but no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the nature of build scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. It emphasizes the absence of suspicious code or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate for a build script.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical build setup, with conditional multithreading support and platform detection, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard build configuration script with platform-specific adjustments and optional features. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correctly assessed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a typical setup script for a Python C extension, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — matches the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. The code is a standard build script for a Python extension module, with platform-specific configurations and optional features.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Malware and Security Risk Scores:** All are 0 or very low, consistent with the content.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** The only external dependency is `get_git_version()`, but its implementation isn't provided. Its role appears to be version retrieval, not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** — code is transparent.\n\n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — very low, typical for build scripts.\n\n**Note:** No evidence suggests any supply chain attack, backdoor, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
