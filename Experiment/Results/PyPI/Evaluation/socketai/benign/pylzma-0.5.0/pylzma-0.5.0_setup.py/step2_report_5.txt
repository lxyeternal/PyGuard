  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Build configuration script for pylzma, platform detection, and build setup.\n- Key points: No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, external get_git_version() function is external and appears benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2 (low, as it's a build script)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar build setup with focus on multithreading and features.\n- Key points: No malicious code, no external data handling, standard build process.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (negligible)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Conclusion: Legitimate build script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Build configuration with optional multithreading, compatibility.\n- Key points: No suspicious activity, no external data processing, standard build logic.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical build script.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Build setup for the pylzma package.\n- Key points: No network, data leaks, or obfuscated code; standard platform detection and configuration.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- Conclusion: Completely benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard build script for pylzma, platform-specific configs.\n- Key points: No malicious activity, no external data sinks, no suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The external function `get_git_version()` is not provided but appears to be a benign versioning utility.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low, reflecting the nature of the code as a build configuration script.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension module.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only external dependency, `get_git_version()`, is typical for versioning and not malicious.\n- The code handles platform-specific compilation flags and optional features in a standard manner.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, as it's a build script with minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose a supply chain security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify external functions like `get_git_version()` for potential vulnerabilities, but based on the provided information, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
