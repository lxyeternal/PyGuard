  "conclusion": "The script is a standard bootstrap utility with insecure download practices that could be exploited in a supply chain attack. There is no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure download and execution of unverified remote code, which elevates the security risk. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.5 due to the potential for exploitation stemming from insecure practices."
