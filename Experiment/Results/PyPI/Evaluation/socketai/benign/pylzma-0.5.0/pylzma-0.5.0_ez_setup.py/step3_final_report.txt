  "purpose": "Bootstrap installer for setuptools, downloads and installs specified versions.",
  "sources": "URL downloads (urllib, PowerShell, curl, wget), archive extraction, setup.py execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup.py, manipulation of sys.modules, external command calls.",
  "flows": "Download via insecure methods -> extract archive -> run setup.py -> modify sys.modules -> execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of insecure download functions (download_file_insecure), dynamic module unloading, execution of remote setup.py without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a bootstrap installer for setuptools, employing multiple download methods including insecure ones that bypass SSL verification. It manipulates sys.modules to unload certain modules and executes setup.py scripts directly, which could be exploited if the downloaded files are malicious or tampered with. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The insecure download practices and execution of remote code without validation pose supply chain risks but do not constitute malware or malicious payloads themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard bootstrap utility with insecure download practices that could be exploited in a supply chain attack. There is no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure download and execution of unverified remote code, which elevates the security risk. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.5 due to the potential for exploitation stemming from insecure practices.",
