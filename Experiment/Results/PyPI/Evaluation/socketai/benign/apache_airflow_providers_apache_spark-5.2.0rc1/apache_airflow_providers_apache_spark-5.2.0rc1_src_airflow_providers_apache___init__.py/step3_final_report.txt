  "purpose": "Standard Python namespace package setup using pkgutil.extend_path",
  "sources": "Import of pkgutil and extension of __path__ variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import of pkgutil -> extend_path modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkgutil dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The reports indicate no issues, and the code aligns with common Python packaging practices. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package extension snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
