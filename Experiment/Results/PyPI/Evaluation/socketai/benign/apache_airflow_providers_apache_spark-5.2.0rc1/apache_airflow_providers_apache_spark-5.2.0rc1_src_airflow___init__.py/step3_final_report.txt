{
  "purpose": "This code extends the __path__ variable for a namespace package using pkgutil.extend_path, which is standard for modular Python packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the __name__ variable to modify the package's search path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source (__path__ and __name__) are used in extend_path to modify __path__, with no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical pattern for namespace packages, using pkgutil.extend_path to allow multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The reports provided are empty, indicating no additional information or issues. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of security issues. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
