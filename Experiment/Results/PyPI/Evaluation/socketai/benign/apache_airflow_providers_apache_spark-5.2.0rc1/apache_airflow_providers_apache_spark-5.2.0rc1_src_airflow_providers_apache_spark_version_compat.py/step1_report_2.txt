{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to retrieve the Apache Airflow version as a tuple of major, minor, and micro components and sets boolean flags based on the version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing __version__, parsing it with packaging.version.Version, and then comparing the parsed version to fixed version tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without obfuscated logic or suspicious code patterns. It does not handle any user input, network activity, or sensitive data. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from airflow, then parses it using the packaging library to extract version components. It then compares the current version against specific version thresholds. The structure and logic are standard and intended for feature gating based on version. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; it performs version checks for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version checking without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks, serving only a functional purpose related to software version management.",
