  "purpose": "Determine if the installed airflow version meets specified minimum versions for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from airflow, using packaging.version.Version to parse version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs version comparison internally.",
  "flows": "Import __version__ -> parse with Version -> compare to version tuples -> set boolean flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing and comparison, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports airflow's __version__, parses it with packaging.version.Version, and sets boolean flags based on version thresholds. It performs simple, standard version comparison for compatibility checks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The logic is clear, and the code does not handle untrusted input or perform network operations. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low; only a minimal security risk score of 0.1 was noted in one report, which is unjustified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for checking airflow version compatibility. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; all malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and security risk should be 0 across all reports.",
