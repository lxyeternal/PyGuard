  "purpose": "Define utility functions and constants to determine the installed Airflow version for conditional logic based on version thresholds.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ attribute from the airflow package to determine the installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; primarily version checking.",
  "flows": "Import __version__, parse version, compare with version tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version comparison logic. The function calls are made at import time, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from airflow, then uses packaging.version.Version to parse and extract version components. It defines constants to check if the Airflow version is >= 2.10.0 or >= 3.0.0. No suspicious or malicious behavior or code injection observed. The code serves a version compatibility purpose, which is typical in software projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for version checking, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks present.",
