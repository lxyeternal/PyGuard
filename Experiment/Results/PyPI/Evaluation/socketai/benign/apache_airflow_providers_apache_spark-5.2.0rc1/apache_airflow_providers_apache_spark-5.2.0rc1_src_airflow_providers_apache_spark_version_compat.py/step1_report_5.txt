{
  "purpose": "The code determines the installed version of Apache Airflow and compares it to specific version thresholds to set boolean flags indicating whether the version is greater than or equal to certain versions.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ imported from airflow, and the import of the packaging.version.Version class.",
  "sinks": "The comparison operations to set AIRFLOW_V_2_10_PLUS and AIRFLOW_V_3_0_PLUS.",
  "flows": "The __version__ string is converted into a Version object, then the major, minor, and micro parts are extracted and used for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code performs version parsing and comparison, which are standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Version class from packaging.version and the __version__ attribute from airflow. It then converts __version__ into a Version object to parse its components. Two boolean flags are set based on whether the current Airflow version meets specified thresholds. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code behavior. The operations are standard version checks for compatibility or feature toggling. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, legitimate version check for Airflow and sets flags accordingly. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
