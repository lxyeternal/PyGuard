  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `__version__` from the `airflow` package.\n- Uses `packaging.version.Version` to parse the version string.\n- Extracts major, minor, micro components.\n- Defines boolean constants to check if the version is >= 2.10.0 and >= 3.0.0.\n- Purpose: Utility for version-based conditional logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code performs straightforward version parsing and comparison. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- **Functionality:** It correctly retrieves and compares version info, which is standard practice.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed. No obfuscation, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Security implications:** The code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities; it’s a benign utility.\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n- **Reports 1-5:** All describe the code as a benign, standard version check utility, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Security risk score:** Consistently 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Possible discrepancies:\n- The **securityRisk** score in report 3 is 0.1, which is slightly above zero. Given the code's benign nature, this seems marginally high. It could be a default or conservative estimate, but there's no justification for even a small risk here.\n- **Overall consistency:** All reports are aligned in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard version utility with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and the detailed review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard utility for version checking, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
