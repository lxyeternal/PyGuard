{
  "purpose": "Define functions and variables to check the installed Airflow version against specific version thresholds.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the airflow module and imports the Version class from packaging.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects external systems or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing version info, creating a Version object, and comparing it to predefined version tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the Airflow version, and compares it to specific version thresholds to set boolean flags. It uses standard practices and does not execute any untrusted code or perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward version check implementation without malicious intent. It solely compares version numbers for conditional logic related to Airflow versions.",
