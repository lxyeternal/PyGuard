  "purpose": "Determine the base version of Apache Airflow installed by retrieving the version tuple.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version string from the __version__ attribute in the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "The version string is parsed into a Version object to compare with specific version tuples.",
  "flows": "The code reads the __version__ from airflow, converts it to a Version object, and compares major, minor, micro components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward version check using standard libraries and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from airflow, converts it into a packaging.version.Version object, then extracts major, minor, and micro components to form a tuple. It then compares this tuple with predefined version thresholds to determine if the current airflow version meets certain criteria. The process involves standard version handling and comparison without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, structured, and performs a common version check operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for Airflow, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses well-established libraries and performs a benign function of version comparison.",
