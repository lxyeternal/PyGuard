  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility for checking the installed Airflow version.\n- The code imports `__version__` from the airflow package, uses `packaging.version.Version` to parse it, and compares it to predefined version tuples.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is detected in any report.\n- The purpose is clearly for compatibility or feature gating based on version, which is a common pattern.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - **Logic & anomalies:** Correct, standard version comparison.\n   - **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n   - **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign utility.\n   \n2. **Report 2:**\n   - **Logic & anomalies:** Same as above, straightforward.\n   - **Malware score:** 0.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - **Logic & anomalies:** Same pattern, no issues.\n   - **Malware score:** 0.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.1 — *this is questionable.* The report indicates no malicious behavior, and the code is just version checking. The small risk score seems unwarranted unless there's some hidden context not evident here.\n   \n4. **Report 4:**\n   - **Logic & anomalies:** Clear, standard version comparison.\n   - **Malware score:** 0.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - **Logic & anomalies:** Same as others, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Malware score:** 0.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** \n  - Most are 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Report 3** has a risk score of 0.1, which seems unjustified given the benign description and straightforward code. Unless there's an external context (e.g., version info being manipulated), this should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, safe version check utility.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The minor risk score in report 3 should be adjusted to 0.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |  <-- adjusted from 0.1 to 0\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign utility for version checking with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores should reflect that, with all malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are justified here. The code is a standard pattern for version detection.",
