  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility class for executing Spark SQL commands, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is ensuring that inputs like 'sql' and 'cmd' are validated or sanitized to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation should be implemented in deployment to mitigate this risk."
