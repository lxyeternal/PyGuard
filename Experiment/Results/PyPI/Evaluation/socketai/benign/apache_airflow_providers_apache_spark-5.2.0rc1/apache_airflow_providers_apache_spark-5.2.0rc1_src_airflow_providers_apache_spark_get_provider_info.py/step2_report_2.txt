  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, auto-generated configuration function. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, external input processing, or data manipulation. The code is purely static data return, which is typical for such configuration modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, there is no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity or intent is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static nature of the code. They correctly interpret the code as configuration data without operational or malicious implications.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated Python function returning static configuration data for an Airflow provider. It contains no dynamic code, no external input handling, no network activity, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this and assign zero risk scores.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
