  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no external input handling or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is purely configuration metadata, with no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and well-structured.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Concerns and Justifications:**\n- Since the code is static configuration data, the risk of supply chain attack or malicious intent is minimal.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any network operations or code execution.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is appropriate, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code appears safe, benign, and typical of auto-generated configuration modules.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a static, auto-generated configuration module for the Apache Spark provider in Apache Airflow. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
