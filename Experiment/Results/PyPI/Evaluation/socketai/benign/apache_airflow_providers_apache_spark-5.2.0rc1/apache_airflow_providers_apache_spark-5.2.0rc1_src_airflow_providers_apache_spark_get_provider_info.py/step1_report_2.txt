  "purpose": "The function get_provider_info() returns a dictionary with metadata about the Apache Spark provider, including its name, description, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from no external sources or user input; it is a static function returning a hardcoded dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with standard metadata. No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function returning a structured dictionary with metadata about the Apache Spark provider for Airflow. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no external communications. All elements are static strings and lists related to documentation, modules, hooks, and connection types. The structure and content are consistent with a normal auto-generated configuration or metadata provider. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. It appears to be safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static metadata function that provides configuration information about the Apache Spark provider for Airflow. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
