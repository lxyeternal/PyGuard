  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to provide metadata and configuration information for the Apache Spark provider in Apache Airflow, including details about operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data defined within the get_provider_info() function, including hardcoded strings, URLs, and module names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or user data.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the function returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is well-structured and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning a dictionary with metadata about an Apache Airflow provider for Apache Spark. It contains predefined strings and lists, such as URLs, module names, class names, and descriptions, all of which are standard configuration data. There are no external input sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no indications of malicious intent. The structure and content are typical of auto-generated configuration modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code appears safe and intended for configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated configuration module for an Airflow provider, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe to use and does not contain any malware or security vulnerabilities.",
