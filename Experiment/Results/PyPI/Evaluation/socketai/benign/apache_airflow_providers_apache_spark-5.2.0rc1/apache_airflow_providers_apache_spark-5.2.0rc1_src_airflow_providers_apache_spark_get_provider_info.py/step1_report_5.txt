  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for the Apache Spark provider in Apache Airflow, including package details, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it solely returns a static dictionary with configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code only returns a predefined dictionary.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function returns static data with no external dependencies or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be automatically generated, contains no obfuscated code, and has no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It strictly provides configuration metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function returning a static dictionary with metadata related to Apache Spark integration in Airflow. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic data processing. The structure is straightforward, with no code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The content is consistent with a generated configuration module for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static configuration provider for an Airflow package related to Apache Spark. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code is purely informational and has no operational or security concerns.",
