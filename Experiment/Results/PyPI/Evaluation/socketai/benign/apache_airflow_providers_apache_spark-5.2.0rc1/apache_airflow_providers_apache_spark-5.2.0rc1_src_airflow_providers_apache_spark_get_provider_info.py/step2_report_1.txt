  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static, auto-generated function returning configuration metadata for the Apache Spark provider in Apache Airflow.\n- No external input handling, no data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code are identified.\n- The code appears safe, benign, and typical of open-source configuration modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code based on the reports. The code is straightforward, static, and does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None identified.\n- **Security flaws:** None identified.\n- **Obfuscation or malicious code:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is purely static and informational.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly assume the code is static and safe.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified; the code is clearly configuration data.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a static function returning predefined metadata, with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no network activity.  \n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is safe, benign, and typical for an auto-generated configuration module.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No further security review or mitigation is required for this code snippet.",
