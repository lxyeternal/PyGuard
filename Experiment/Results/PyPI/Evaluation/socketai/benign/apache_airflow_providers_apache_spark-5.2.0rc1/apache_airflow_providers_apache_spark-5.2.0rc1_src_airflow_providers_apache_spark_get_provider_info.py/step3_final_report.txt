  "purpose": "Provides static metadata about the Apache Spark provider for Apache Airflow, including integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "No external input; static data returned by the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; purely static return value.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning a fixed dictionary with provider metadata. It contains URLs, module names, class names, and descriptive strings. There are no dynamic code segments, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code. The structure is typical for configuration modules in open-source projects. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications or further security review are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
