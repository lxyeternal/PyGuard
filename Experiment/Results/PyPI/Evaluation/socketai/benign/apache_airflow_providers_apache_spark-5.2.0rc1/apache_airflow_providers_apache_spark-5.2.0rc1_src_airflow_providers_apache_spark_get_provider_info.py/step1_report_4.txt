{
  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration details for the Apache Spark provider in Apache Airflow, including package info, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "Static data within the get_provider_info() function that returns a dictionary containing package and integration information.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or processes untrusted data; it mainly returns a static data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply returns predefined static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, containing only static data and function definitions. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, automatically generated Python function that returns a dictionary with package and integration metadata. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no external communication. It consists solely of data definition and return statements, which are typical for configuration modules. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration/data return function with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of the Apache Airflow provider package setup.",
