{
  "purpose": "The function provides metadata and configuration details about the Apache Spark provider for Apache Airflow, including integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and task decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads static information from the function return statement and external URLs for documentation and logos.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not write data externally or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static data definitions in the return dictionary to external URLs for documentation and logos, with no data passing from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is purely static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a dictionary with configuration data about the Apache Spark provider for Airflow. It references external URLs and module names but does not process or execute any untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with standard plugin/provider definitions. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet for the Apache Airflow Spark provider. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no signs of obfuscation or malware. It is safe and typical of open-source provider metadata definitions.",
