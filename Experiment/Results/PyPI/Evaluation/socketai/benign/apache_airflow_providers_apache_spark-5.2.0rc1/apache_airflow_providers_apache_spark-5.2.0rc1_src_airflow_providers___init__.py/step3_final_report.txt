  "purpose": "Supports Python namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports pkgutil to extend the module's search path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is a benign package setup statement.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing pkgutil and extending __path__, with no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present in this straightforward code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are empty, only indicating 'Empty response,' which provides no evidence of issues. Given the lack of detailed findings, the code appears benign, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero, consistent with the absence of evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard; the reports do not contain any evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
