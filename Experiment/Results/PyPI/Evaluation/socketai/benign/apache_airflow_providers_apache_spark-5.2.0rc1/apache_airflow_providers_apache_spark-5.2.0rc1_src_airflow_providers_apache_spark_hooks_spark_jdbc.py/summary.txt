  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific extension for Spark-JDBC operations within Airflow. It handles connection details securely, avoids hardcoded secrets, and performs no malicious actions. The minor security concern about passing credentials via command-line is acceptable in controlled environments. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent."
