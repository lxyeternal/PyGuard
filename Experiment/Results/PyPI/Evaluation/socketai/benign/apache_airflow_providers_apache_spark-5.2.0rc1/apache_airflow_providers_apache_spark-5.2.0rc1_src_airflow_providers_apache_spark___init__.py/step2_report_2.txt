  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated module for version validation.\n- It imports `packaging.version`, `airflow.__version__`, and defines `__version__`.\n- It performs a straightforward comparison: if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is consistent across reports and aligns with typical dependency validation patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The version check logic is correct and present.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**Report 1-5 Analysis:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- They mention the double parsing of `packaging.version.parse` as redundant but not malicious.\n- The exception raising is controlled and expected.\n- The code is auto-generated and contains no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- `malware`: 0 (correct)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n- `confidence`: 1 (appropriate given the straightforward nature)\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a typical version check, with no malicious intent.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n- The only minor concern is the double parsing of `packaging.version.parse`, which is redundant but not harmful.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The logic is sound.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for version enforcement, but this is standard and safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, performs a standard version check, and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, straightforward, and safe. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
