  "purpose": "Perform a version check to ensure the installed Apache Airflow version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0) for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the current Airflow version via 'airflow.__version__' and the imported 'packaging.version' for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the version check fails; no other sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'airflow.__version__' -> Parses version with 'packaging.version.parse' -> Compares to '2.9.0' -> Raises exception if below minimum.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant double parsing of 'packaging.version.parse', but this is harmless and likely an artifact of auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version validation: it imports necessary modules, retrieves the current Airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. If the environment's version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. No secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The double parsing of 'packaging.version.parse' is redundant but not harmful. The code is standard for dependency validation and compatibility enforcement, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version check for an Apache Airflow provider. It performs a simple, safe validation without any malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.",
