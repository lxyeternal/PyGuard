{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it runs with the correct Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute and the packaging.version module for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which halts execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads the airflow_version and compares it with a required minimum version; if the condition fails, it raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior are present. The version string is static, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, checks the Airflow version, and raises an error if the version is below 2.9.0. It uses standard libraries and follows typical version checking patterns. No external data is read at runtime other than the imported __version__, and no untrusted inputs are processed. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a version compatibility check for an Apache Airflow provider, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard and safe version validation script.",
