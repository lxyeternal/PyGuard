{
  "purpose": "This code defines version checks and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package, and sets the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment or package data, specifically the Airflow version imported from airflow.__version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the current Airflow version, parsing it, and raising an error if the version is below 2.9.0.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. The version string is hardcoded, but that is standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version comparison between the current Airflow version and a minimum required version. It raises an error if the condition is not met. The logic is straightforward and uses standard Python practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. It validates environment conditions before proceeding.",
