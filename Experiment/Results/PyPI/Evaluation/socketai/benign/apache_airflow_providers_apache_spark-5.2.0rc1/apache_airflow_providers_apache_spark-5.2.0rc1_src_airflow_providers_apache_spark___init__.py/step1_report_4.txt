{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated Python module that sets version constraints and licensing information for a package related to Apache Airflow providers, specifically for Apache Spark integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`packaging.version`, `airflow.__version__`), string literals (`__version__`, version comparison string '2.9.0'), and the `if` statement with a runtime version check.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and RuntimeError raise can affect program flow but do not constitute a data leak or malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Assignments -> Version parsing -> Conditional check -> Possible exception raise.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code performs straightforward version validation and licensing info. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard license header followed by import statements and a version check to ensure compatibility. It raises an exception if the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0. No data inputs from untrusted sources are processed beyond reading existing package/module versions, and no dangerous operations are performed. The code is clean, well-structured, and intended for dependency validation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, generated dependency validation script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It only performs version checking and licensing documentation. No security risks or malicious signals are identified.",
