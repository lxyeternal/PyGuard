{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring that the Airflow version meets minimum requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported `airflow.__version__` and the local `__version__` variable.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the Airflow version, parsing it, comparing it to a threshold, and potentially raising an error based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code follows standard version checking patterns. The only notable point is the double parsing of `packaging.version.parse` which is redundant but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version handling libraries, checks the current Airflow version, and raises an error if the version is too low. The code includes licensing information and auto-generation notices. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe behaviors present. It performs a straightforward compatibility check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard version check with no signs of malicious intent. It ensures compatibility and halts execution if requirements are not met.",
