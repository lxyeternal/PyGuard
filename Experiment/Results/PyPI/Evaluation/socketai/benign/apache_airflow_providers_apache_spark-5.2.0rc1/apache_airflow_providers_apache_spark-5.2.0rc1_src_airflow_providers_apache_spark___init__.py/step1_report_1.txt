{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated Python module for an Apache Airflow provider, mainly used for version checking and module initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for packaging.version, airflow.__version__, and hardcoded __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raised if version check fails; however, this is a controlled RuntimeError.",
  "flows": "Import airflow version -> compare with hardcoded version -> raise error if condition met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs version validation and module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines __all__ and __version__, and performs a version check against airflow. If the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError with a message. The code is straightforward, generated automatically, and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated module for version validation in an Apache Airflow provider package. It performs basic version comparison and error handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
