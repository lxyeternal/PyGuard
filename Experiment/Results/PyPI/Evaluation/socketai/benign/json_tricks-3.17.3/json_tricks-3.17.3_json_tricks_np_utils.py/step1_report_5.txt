{
  "purpose": "The code provides backward compatibility by importing specific functions and modules from a utils module and numpy, with commented-out code for numpy import handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from .utils and .utils, and numpy (aliased as np).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no processing of untrusted input or data, no data leaks, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for dynamic import handling of numpy suggests previous attempt to handle missing dependencies, but no active dynamic code or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly contains import statements and a comment. It imports functions from a relative utils module and attempts to import numpy as np. The commented-out code hints at handling missing numpy modules but is inactive. There are no data processing, user input handling, or suspicious behaviors observed. No embedded malicious code, data leaks, or external communications are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and typical for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple compatibility shim without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any sensitive operations, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security concerns.",
