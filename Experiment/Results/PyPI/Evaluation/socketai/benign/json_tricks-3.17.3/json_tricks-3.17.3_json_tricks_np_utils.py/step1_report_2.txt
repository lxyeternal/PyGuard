{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a backward compatibility shim, importing utility functions and a module for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'utils' module and the 'np' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or propagated; only static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; imports are static and do not involve user input.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code attempting to import specific numpy types; no active malicious code. The comments suggest previous dependency handling logic but no malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local utils module, possibly for hashing, scalar representation, and scalar encoding. It also imports a numpy module alias. The commented code hints at a fallback import for numpy types, which is not active. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The code's purpose is likely to maintain compatibility across different environments or versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
