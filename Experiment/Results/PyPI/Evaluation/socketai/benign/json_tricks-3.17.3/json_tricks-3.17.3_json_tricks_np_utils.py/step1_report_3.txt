{
  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by importing functions and modules related to hashing, scalar representation, encoding, and numpy.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'utils' module and the 'np' (numpy) module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly imports functions and modules without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not perform data flow operations, only imports.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code that attempts to import numpy functions and handle import errors. The presence of commented code suggests possible future or alternative numpy handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of imports and a comment about backward compatibility. It imports specific functions from a utils module, which could be used elsewhere for hashing, scalar conversion, and encoding. The commented-out block indicates an attempt to handle numpy import errors, but as it is commented, it does not execute. There are no indications of suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears standard for maintaining compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import wrapper aimed at backward compatibility. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The code is benign.",
