{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a backward compatibility layer, importing utility functions and modules to maintain compatibility with older versions or other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from the '.utils' module and the local 'np' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data processing or external communication occurs within this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports flow from '.utils' to the current module; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out numpy import code suggests handling optional dependencies, but no suspicious or obfuscated logic present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a utils module, likely used elsewhere in the project. The commented-out block indicates an optional import of numpy components, with an exception handling that raises a custom exception if numpy isn't available. There are no functions, data processing, or network activity. No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility utility with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not process untrusted data nor perform any potentially dangerous operations.",
