  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by importing utility functions and numpy module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local utils module and numpy.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Imports from utils module to potentially other parts of the package; no runtime data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to numpy import; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a utils module, likely for internal use, and imports numpy as np. The commented-out try-except block suggests handling for numpy import failures, but it is inactive. There are no function calls, data handling, or network activity; code is only for module setup and backward compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving only to support legacy compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
