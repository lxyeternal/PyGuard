  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal import wrapper serving backward compatibility purposes. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are appropriate, with the minor note that the small security risk score in one report could be adjusted to zero, but even as is, it remains negligible."
