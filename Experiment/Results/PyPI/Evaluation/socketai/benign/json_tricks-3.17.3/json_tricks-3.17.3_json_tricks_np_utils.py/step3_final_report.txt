  "purpose": "A minimal import wrapper for backward compatibility, importing functions from utils and handling numpy dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from .utils and . modules, including a commented-out numpy import error handling code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Static imports without data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code related to numpy import error handling; no active anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module maintaining backward compatibility by importing specific functions. The commented-out code indicates previous error handling for numpy but is inactive. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. The code's simplicity and static nature mean it poses no security threats or malicious behavior. The commented code does not introduce vulnerabilities, and the overall structure is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal import wrapper serving backward compatibility purposes. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are appropriate, with the minor note that the small security risk score in one report could be adjusted to zero, but even as is, it remains negligible.",
