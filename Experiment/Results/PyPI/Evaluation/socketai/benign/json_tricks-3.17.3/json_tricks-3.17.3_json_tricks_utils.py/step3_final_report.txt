  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, compression, dynamic class handling, and reflection, primarily for serialization and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Data structures (dicts, lists, tuples), input parameters for functions, class objects for module and class inspection.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic import functions and in-place data modifications that could be exploited if supplied with untrusted input, leading to arbitrary code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data or class/module names flow into dynamic import and inspection functions, which may lead to execution or access of external modules/classes if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and reflection functions that, if misused with untrusted data, could lead to security issues; no hardcoded secrets or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for serialization, compression, and dynamic class/module handling. It employs safe error handling and standard practices. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import functions if external inputs are untrusted, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. No malicious code, obfuscation, or active malicious behavior is present. The risk is moderate and depends on input validation. The code's overall design is benign, serving as a utility library with controlled risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily safe utility functions with some dynamic features that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential misuse scenarios but no inherent malicious intent.",
