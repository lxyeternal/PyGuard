  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured deserialization utility that handles complex data types securely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The potential for misuse exists in the context of deserializing untrusted data into class instances, but this is a known risk inherent to deserialization routines and not indicative of malicious intent. Scores should reflect a low malware and obfuscation risk, with a slight increase in overall security risk due to potential misuse, but no active malicious activity."
