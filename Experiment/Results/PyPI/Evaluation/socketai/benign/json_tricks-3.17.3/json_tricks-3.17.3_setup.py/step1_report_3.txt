  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'json_tricks' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports version info; imports version from json_tricks._version; reads requirements based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads external files and version info; uses imported version in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with commented-out code and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading a README file, importing version info from a local module, conditional requirements based on Python version, and defining package metadata. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted input, does not include network operations, code injection, or obfuscated code. The commented-out code and warnings are benign. The code appears standard for Python package setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
