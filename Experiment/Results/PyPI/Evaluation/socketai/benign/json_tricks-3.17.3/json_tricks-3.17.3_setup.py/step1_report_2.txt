  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'json_tricks' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing version info from json_tricks._version, and setting up package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform network or system operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; primarily static data and package setup routines.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code (reading version from a file), no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading a README, importing version info, and defining dependencies and metadata. The version check raises warnings for unsupported Python versions, which is standard. No input sanitization or network activity occurs. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware-related functions are present. The code is well-structured and follows conventional practices. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not include any behavior that could be considered malicious or harmful.",
