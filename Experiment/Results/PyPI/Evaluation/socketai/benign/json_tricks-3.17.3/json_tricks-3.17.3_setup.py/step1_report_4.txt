  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'json_tricks', used for packaging and distributing the module.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content, imports version information from 'json_tricks._version', and reads package metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that handle untrusted input data; the setup script primarily reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or storage; the script only reads static files and defines package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The commented code and warnings are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, importing version info, reading a README file, and defining package metadata. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The commented lines do not contain malicious content. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed. The code follows standard packaging practices and contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles only static files and package metadata, with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
