  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package (`json_tricks`).\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no external command execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no network activity.\n- Commented-out code (reading version from a file) is benign and common in setup scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n- The version import from `json_tricks._version` appears legitimate.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers follow standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs expected setup tasks correctly.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent; the script does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor point is the commented-out code, which is harmless.\n- The email address appears legitimate and publicly available; no secrets are embedded.\n- The version check raises warnings for unsupported Python versions, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or risky behavior.\n- No code injection, external data handling, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.\n- The version check and warnings are standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided reports' scores. The code is safe, standard, and free of security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
