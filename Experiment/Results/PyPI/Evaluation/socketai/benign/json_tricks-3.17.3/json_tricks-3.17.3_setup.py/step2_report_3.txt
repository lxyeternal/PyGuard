  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer correctly identifies that the script performs standard package setup procedures. No untrusted data processing, external command execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the commented-out code, which is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard setup procedures, no suspicious activity, no obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is typical for a setup script, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious patterns, no external data handling, no suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is typical for packaging, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is typical for package configuration, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no indication of security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library. It reads static files, imports version info, sets dependencies based on Python version, and defines package metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The commented-out code is benign and typical in such scripts.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire set of reports is accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
