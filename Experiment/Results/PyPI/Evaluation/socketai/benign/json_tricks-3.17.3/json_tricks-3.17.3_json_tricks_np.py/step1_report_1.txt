{
  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by importing various functions and classes from submodules and handling numpy import dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.nonp, .utils, .comment, .encoders, .decoders) and optional import of numpy.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as the code primarily manages imports and deprecation warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated functions and warnings, but no malicious or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules, issues a deprecation warning, and handles optional numpy import. It raises exceptions if numpy is not installed and does not perform any data processing or external communication. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or malicious intent is evident. The presence of deprecated features suggests maintenance but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a backward compatibility shim that handles imports and deprecation warnings without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
