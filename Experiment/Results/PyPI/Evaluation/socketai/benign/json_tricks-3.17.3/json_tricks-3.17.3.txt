      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured deserialization utility that handles complex data types securely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The potential for misuse exists in the context of deserializing untrusted data into class instances, but this is a known risk inherent to deserialization routines and not indicative of malicious intent. Scores should reflect a low malware and obfuscation risk, with a slight increase in overall security risk due to potential misuse, but no active malicious activity."

The existing scores are appropriate, with the minor note that the small security risk score in one report could be adjusted to zero, but even as is, it remains negligible."

The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report overestimates the actual risk; it should be 0. All assessments are consistent with the code's behavior."
