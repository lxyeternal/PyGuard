  "purpose": "The code fragment appears to define a version string, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the string '3.17.3' to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version assignment statement, which is common in Python packages for tracking version numbers. No input handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign version declaration typical in Python projects.",
