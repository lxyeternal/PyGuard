{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version string, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assignment for VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a static version string with no additional code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment for a version identifier. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious behaviors. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or security risks. Since the code is minimal, it appears to serve a typical purpose of versioning within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a static version string declaration. No malware or security risks are identified.",
