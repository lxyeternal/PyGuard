  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable (`VERSION = '3.17.3'`). There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic behavior, or external data handling. The code is benign and serves a typical purpose in package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They uniformly conclude that the code is harmless, with no suspicious activity. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- Malware: 0 (no malware)\n- Security Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, raising the risk score would be unjustified. The code is straightforward and does not pose any threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all recognize the code as a simple version string assignment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: minimal risk, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, static version string assignment with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary. The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.",
