  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the assignment is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static assignment of a version string to a variable, with no external data, dynamic behavior, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely versioning, and it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
