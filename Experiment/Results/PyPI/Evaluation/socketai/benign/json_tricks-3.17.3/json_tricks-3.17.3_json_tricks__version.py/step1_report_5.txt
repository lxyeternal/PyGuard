  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No output or data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code execution, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single string assignment setting VERSION to '3.17.3'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a version identifier, which is a common pattern in Python modules or packages. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward version declaration without any malicious or suspicious features. It poses no security risk.",
