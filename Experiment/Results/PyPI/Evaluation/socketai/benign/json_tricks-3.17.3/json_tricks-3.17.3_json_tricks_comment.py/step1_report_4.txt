{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to remove comments from a string containing JSON-like data, supporting multiple comment symbols such as '#' and '//'.",
  "sources": "Input string containing JSON data with comments, read at the parameter 'string'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "Input string is split into lines, each line is processed to remove comments based on specified symbols, then recombined into a cleaned string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The regex used for comment detection is straightforward and targeted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to strip comments from a single line based on a comment symbol, considering quoted strings to avoid removing comment-like patterns inside strings. The main function splits the input into lines, processes each line for all comment symbols, and reconstructs the string without comments. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard comment removal utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comment removal utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs a legitimate operation to clean JSON-like data from comments. The overall security risk is negligible.",
