{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to remove comments from a string containing JSON-like content, supporting multiple comment symbols such as '#' and '//'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'string' parameter and the 'line' parameter within the 'strip_comment_line_with_symbol' function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data to external systems or write to files; it only processes and returns modified string data.",
  "flows": "Input string is split into lines, each line is processed to remove comments starting with specified symbols, and then recombined.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a complex regex to identify comment quotes, which appears to be aimed at avoiding removing comment symbols within string literals. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script processes textual input to strip comments by splitting lines and analyzing quote positions with regex, aiming to preserve string literals while removing comments. No external data flows, network activity, or sensitive data handling are present. The logic appears to be straightforward and conventional for comment removal, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard comment stripper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
