{
  "purpose": "The code aims to remove comments from strings containing code or JSON-like data, supporting multiple comment symbols.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter in strip_comments; individual lines split from the input string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data for execution or leakages; mainly string manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input string -> split into lines -> process each line for comment removal -> recombine into cleaned string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses regex for comment detection but no obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to remove line comments starting with specified symbols (like '#' or '//') from a given string. The method 'strip_comment_line_with_symbol' splits each line and counts quote characters to accurately identify comment boundaries, avoiding breaking string literals. 'strip_comments' applies this function to each line for all comment symbols. No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The approach is standard for comment stripping, and no malicious intent or malware indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of comment removal from code or JSON-like strings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function intended for preprocessing text data.",
