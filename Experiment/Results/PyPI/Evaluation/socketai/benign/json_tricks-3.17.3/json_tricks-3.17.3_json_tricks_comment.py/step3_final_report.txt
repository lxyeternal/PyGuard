  "purpose": "Remove comments from code or JSON-like strings, supporting symbols like '#' and '//', while respecting string literals.",
  "sources": "Input string split into lines; comment symbols within lines; string literals identified via regex.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only processes strings locally without external data or network access.",
  "flows": "Input string -> split into lines -> process each line to remove comments respecting quotes -> join lines back into output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex complexity is for quote boundary detection, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a utility to strip comments from strings, carefully handling string literals with regex. No external data access, network calls, or malicious code are present. The regex is complex but appears correct for its purpose. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.2). Given the straightforward nature, the security risk should be set to 0, and malware/obfuscated scores remain at 0. The code is safe, clear, and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate comment removal utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports' assessments are accurate; minor adjustments to security risk scores (to 0) are recommended for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
