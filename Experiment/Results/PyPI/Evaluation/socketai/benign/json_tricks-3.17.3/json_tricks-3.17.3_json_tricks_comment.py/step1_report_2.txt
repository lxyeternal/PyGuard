{
  "purpose": "The code aims to remove comments from a string containing code or text, specifically stripping line comments starting with symbols like '#' or '//'.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'string' that contains the code or text with comments, and 'comment_symbols' which determine comment delimiters.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input string to produce a comment-free version but does not write to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "The input string is split into lines; each line is processed to remove comments starting with specified symbols, and the cleaned lines are joined back into a string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a complex regex to detect quote characters and comments, but it only manipulates local variables and strings. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. No external data access or side effects are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'strip_comment_line_with_symbol' and 'strip_comments'. The first uses regex to identify quote boundaries to avoid removing comments inside strings. The second iterates over each line and comment symbols to strip comments safely. The logic appears focused on comment removal, with careful handling of string literals. No malicious or suspicious operations are present, and the code is straightforward for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comment stripper utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It safely processes input text to remove comments based on common comment symbols. No malware indicators or security risks are evident.",
