{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to remove comments from a string containing code or JSON-like data, handling different comment styles and edge cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'string' parameter, specifically processing its lines and detecting comment symbols.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for execution or data leakage; it only manipulates strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input string -> split into lines -> for each line, identify and remove comment segments based on symbols -> recombine lines into a cleaned string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The regex used for comment detection is complex but appears intended for correctness, not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to strip comments from code or JSON strings. 'strip_comment_line_with_symbol' processes individual lines to remove comments starting with specified symbols, using regex to identify comment boundaries while respecting string literals. 'strip_comments' applies this to each line of input, handling multiple comment styles. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code operates solely on string manipulation for comment removal, with no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for comment stripping, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears well-structured for its purpose, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
