{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class library for deploying WordPress using AWS CDK constructs, including resource configuration and properties.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party packages, and internal modules; class constructors and property accessors; type hints and debugging functions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external sources, network connections, or file systems; no handling of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data or external systems. The code primarily sets up data structures and resource configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns. The code uses standard patterns for defining AWS CDK constructs and data classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of AWS CDK constructs for deploying WordPress resources. It imports necessary modules, defines a construct class 'WordPress' with properties, and associated data class 'WordPressProps'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are only used for type checking and class initialization. No external inputs are processed in an unsafe manner. The code appears to be standard for infrastructure as code setup, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign AWS CDK library for deploying WordPress, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical infrastructure setup script with proper structure and no malicious intent.",
