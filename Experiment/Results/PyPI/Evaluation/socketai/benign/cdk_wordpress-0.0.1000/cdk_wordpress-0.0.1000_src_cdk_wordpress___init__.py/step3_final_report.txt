{
  "purpose": "The code defines an AWS CDK construct for deploying WordPress, encapsulating resource configuration and infrastructure setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class initializers, and type hints, but does not process external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communications are present; the code constructs AWS resources without external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "The flow involves class instantiation and property access within the infrastructure setup, with no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'pkgutil.extend_path' and 'jsii' imports suggest namespace package handling and SDK code generation, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK construct library for deploying WordPress, with proper type checking, resource class definitions, and properties. It does not perform network operations, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated code. The use of 'extend_path' and version-dependent typeguard logic are typical for namespace packages and compatibility, not malicious features. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The code aligns with best practices for infrastructure as code, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS CDK library for deploying WordPress, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with a benign, standard infrastructure setup.",
