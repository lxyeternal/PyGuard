  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a standard AWS CDK construct library for deploying WordPress, importing typical modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows, no network or file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the `pkgutil.extend_path` import, which is common in namespace packages; no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical infrastructure as code library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard class definitions, type checking, and resource setup.\n- No external data handling or suspicious logic.\n- No anomalies beyond standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on class definitions and type safety.\n- No network, file, or external data leaks.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable given the minimal risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: standard resource configuration, no external untrusted data, no network activity.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Focuses on package setup, type checking, and resource configuration.\n- No external data or malicious patterns.\n- Use of `extend_path` is typical for namespace packages.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious activity:** No evidence across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code's nature as infrastructure setup.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (infrastructure setup, no external data handling, no network activity), a risk score of around **0.1** is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor point is the `pkgutil.extend_path`, which is typical for namespace packages and not suspicious.\n- The typeguard version logic and type checking functions are standard for ensuring type safety and do not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate AWS CDK construct library for deploying WordPress, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
