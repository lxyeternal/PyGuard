{
  "purpose": "Define a construct library for deploying a WordPress application using AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party packages, and internal modules; code creating classes, functions, and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is used in potentially dangerous operations such as network connections, file access, or execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly within class constructors and property methods, handling configuration data; no untrusted input processing or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; code appears standard for AWS CDK constructs; no obfuscated code or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CDK construct for deploying WordPress with associated properties and type-checking functions. It imports standard and AWS CDK modules, sets up data classes and class properties, and ensures type safety. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an infrastructure-as-code library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical AWS CDK construct implementation for deploying WordPress, with no signs of malware or security risks. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
