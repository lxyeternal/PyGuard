  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes a CDK construct library for deploying WordPress.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks observed.\n- **Anomalies:** Import of 'pkgutil.extend_path' and use of 'jsii' suggest generated or SDK code, but no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard CDK infrastructure code, well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code, no malware or security issues.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code) — justified.  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk) — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on class library for deploying WordPress, with no external data handling or suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard AWS CDK code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, a standard CDK construct with no external data or suspicious logic.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, perhaps reflecting minimal concern, but no real risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar findings: no external data, network activity, or malicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2), but still no evidence of actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes a typical package with type checking, namespace extension, and resource configuration.  \n- No external data or suspicious patterns.  \n- The use of 'extend_path' is standard for namespace packages, not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None evident; the code is infrastructure setup code, with standard patterns and no external data leaks or network activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (infrastructure setup), the risk is minimal, but a slight caution (0.1-0.2) could be justified due to the package's deployment role, but not higher.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports indicate legitimate, non-malicious infrastructure code with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would recommend setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0 across the board. The risk scores can remain as they are, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm all malware scores as **0**.  \n- Confirm obfuscated scores as **0**.  \n- Keep risk scores low (0.0–0.2), consistent with the reports.\n\nThis thorough review supports the conclusion that these are safe, standard AWS CDK constructs with no malicious intent.",
