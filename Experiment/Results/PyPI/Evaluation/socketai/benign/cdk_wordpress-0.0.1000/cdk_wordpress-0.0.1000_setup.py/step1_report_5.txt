{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'cdk-wordpress' with specified metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON string with package metadata, reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Writing the long description into the 'kwargs' dictionary, passing setup parameters to setuptools.setup.",
  "flows": "JSON string is parsed into 'kwargs'; 'README.md' content is read and assigned to 'long_description' in 'kwargs'; finally, setup() is called with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code only performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads 'README.md' content for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup with all configuration. All operations are standard for package setup. No external inputs are used that could introduce untrusted data; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations for package configuration.",
