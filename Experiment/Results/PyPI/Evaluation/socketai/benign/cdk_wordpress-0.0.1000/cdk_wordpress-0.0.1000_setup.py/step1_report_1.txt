  "purpose": "This script prepares package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools, including loading metadata from a JSON string and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "JSON string containing package metadata, external file 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function which uses the loaded metadata to create a package; no direct sink of untrusted data or malicious code",
  "flows": "JSON string is parsed and loaded into kwargs, which are then passed to setuptools.setup(), and README.md content is read into long_description",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks without executing any dynamic code or untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package configuration details from a hardcoded JSON string, then reads a README.md file for detailed description, and finally calls setuptools.setup() with this data. There are no signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The data sources are static and safe, and the sinks (setup() call) is standard for Python packaging. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python packaging setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
