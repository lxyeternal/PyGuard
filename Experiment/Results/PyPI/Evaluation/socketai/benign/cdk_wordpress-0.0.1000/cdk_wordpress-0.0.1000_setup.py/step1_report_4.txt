{
  "purpose": "The code prepares and loads metadata for a Python package setup, including dependencies and package information, and then initiates the package installation process.",
  "sources": "Reading external 'README.md' file for long description; JSON string containing package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call which processes all package data and dependencies.",
  "flows": "JSON string -> json.loads() -> kwargs dictionary -> open('README.md') -> setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden dynamic code execution, or unusual data handling observed. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README file for the long description, and then calls setuptools.setup() with the gathered information. All operations are standard for Python package setup procedures. There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The dependencies listed are typical for AWS CDK-related projects. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads metadata, loads a README file, and executes the setup process.",
