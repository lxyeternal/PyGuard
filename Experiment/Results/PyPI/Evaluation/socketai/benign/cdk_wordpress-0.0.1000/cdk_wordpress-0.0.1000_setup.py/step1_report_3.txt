{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package configuration for 'cdk-wordpress', primarily loading metadata from a JSON string and then executing setuptools.setup() to package the module.",
  "sources": "JSON string defining package metadata, reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() call that finalizes package setup, reading 'README.md' as input data.",
  "flows": "JSON metadata is parsed and passed as keyword arguments to setuptools.setup(). The content of 'README.md' is read and assigned to 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads the 'README.md' for long description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with these parameters. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No input data is sourced from untrusted sources; the 'README.md' file appears to be a local file. The JSON string is static within the code. There are no network operations, code injections, or suspicious activities observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads metadata and initiates package setup, which is standard practice.",
