{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module path, imports necessary libraries, dynamically determines the 'typeguard' version, configures typeguard behavior accordingly, loads a JSII assembly from a fixed package archive, and publishes the module. It functions as a standard setup for an AWS CDK JSII-based package.",
  "sources": "The assembly load via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() from a fixed filename ('cdk-wordpress@0.0.1000.jsii.tgz') and version info; import statements for standard, third-party, and AWS CDK modules; version parsing from importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "The assembly load operation; no other untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info from package metadata, then loads a specific assembly file, and publishes the module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; assembly load uses fixed, controlled parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module setup, including path extension, version-dependent typeguard configuration, and loading a known, fixed JSII assembly archive. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The assembly load is typical for JSII packages, assuming the source is trusted. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a routine setup for an AWS CDK JSII module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assembly load is standard and controlled. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with external assembly loading, which appears safe in this context.",
