  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from files, environment variables, user input, network requests) if present, but none are explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, or file writes if they exist; no explicit sinks identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various function calls or processing steps, but no suspicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors identified. The code is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at all parts: beginning, middle, and end. No suspicious or malicious patterns were detected. Usage of libraries and functions appears standard. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or hidden behaviors. The code structure and formatting do not suggest obfuscation or malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious elements or potential attack vectors.",
