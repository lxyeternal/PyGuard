  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to the absence of actual code content.",
  "sources": "Potential data input points are not explicitly visible, but typically include function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules that read data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or system commands; however, none are explicitly observed in the provided content.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks is identifiable without actual code logic; thus, no source-to-sink paths are determined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected due to lack of code content.",
  "analysis": "The review was limited by the absence of code content. As no actual code, imports, or logic is provided, it's impossible to analyze data flows, anomalies, or potential malicious behavior. There are no evident sources, sinks, or flows to evaluate, nor any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detectable. The code appears benign or empty. Further review is not possible without actual code content.",
