{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the monocypher Python bindings and cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "Reading test vector JSON files, generating random data for cryptographic tests, reading secrets from environment or hardcoded in test setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks involved; no output to external systems or network connections detected.",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow from JSON files or random data generators to cryptographic functions and assertions; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of secrets and cryptographic functions appears standard and confined within testing context.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs self-contained unit tests for cryptographic functions using known test vectors, random data, and assertions. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data leakages are evident. No network activity, external data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard cryptographic practices for testing purposes, with proper isolation and no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malware-like activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for cryptographic functions with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely tests cryptographic correctness and behavior within a controlled environment.",
