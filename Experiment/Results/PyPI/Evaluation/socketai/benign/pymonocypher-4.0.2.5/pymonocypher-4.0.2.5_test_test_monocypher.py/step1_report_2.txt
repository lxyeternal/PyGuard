  "purpose": "Unit testing for the monocypher Python binding, including cryptographic functions and algorithms.",
  "sources": "File input for 'blake2-kat.json' containing test vectors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; all data used are either test vectors or generated internally.",
  "flows": "Reading test vectors from JSON file -> cryptographic function calls; internal data flow for testing cryptographic operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (except expected cryptographic keys), or backdoors detected. Use of secrets.token_bytes for seed generation is appropriate. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the monocypher cryptographic library bindings. It loads known test vectors, performs cryptographic computations, and verifies correctness. It uses random data generation for key and message testing, but all data is used internally within tests. The test suite interacts with JSON test vectors, performs cryptographic operations like hashing, signing, key exchange, and elliptic-curve mappings, and validates expected outcomes. No code exhibits malicious behavior, suspicious data leakage, or external network activity. The only external input is the JSON test vector file, which appears to be a standard, known test vector source. The code does not execute untrusted data or include hidden backdoors or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate test suite for cryptographic functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for testing correctness of cryptographic implementations and does not contain any malicious behavior.",
