{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'pymonocypher' Python cryptography bindings, handling extension compilation and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static files (README.md), source files for Cython or C extensions, version and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script performs static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with conditional Cython compilation and static file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python extension package. It conditionally uses Cython if available, reads static files, and configures build extensions. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The version is hardcoded, which is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
