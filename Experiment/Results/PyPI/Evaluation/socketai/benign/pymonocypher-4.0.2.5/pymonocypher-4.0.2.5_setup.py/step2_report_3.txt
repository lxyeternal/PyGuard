  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior, malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The code is primarily about configuring build extensions, reading static files, and setting package metadata.\n- The only minor point is the hardcoded version and the optional use of Cython, which are typical in such scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues detected.** The code is a typical setup script with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:\n- **No errors or flaws detected in any of the reports.** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, code injection, or external communication.\n- No suspicious behavior or backdoors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign very low or zero scores, with one report giving 0.1, which is still minimal.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input, execute external commands, or access sensitive data.\n- The only potential concern is the use of optional Cython compilation, which is standard and not risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The security risk score should be **0** or very close to it, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly note that the script is for packaging, not runtime logic.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious dependencies.\n- The code is consistent with standard practices for Python extension packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                   |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | No risky operations or handling of untrusted data.            |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is a standard, benign setup script for a cryptography binding package.**\n- **No suspicious or malicious activity is present.**\n- **Scores should reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.**\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation or further analysis.",
