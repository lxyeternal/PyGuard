{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing the 'pymonocypher' Python package, which provides bindings to the Monocypher cryptography library.",
  "sources": "File reading for the README.md file, importing setup-related modules, checking for Cython source files, and obtaining version info from a hardcoded variable.",
  "sinks": "The script mainly executes setup procedures and does not handle untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script performs build-time setup without processing user data or untrusted sources during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the version number is hardcoded but benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally uses Cython if available to compile extensions, and reads a README file for description. It sets up package metadata and build configuration without any dynamic or unsafe operations. No embedded code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic is present. All modules and sources are standard for Python package setup, and the code appears clean and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python cryptography binding package with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and aligned with typical package distribution practices.",
