{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building and distributing the pymonocypher Python package, including compilation of Cython or C extensions for cryptography bindings.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory for 'c_monocypher.pyx' file, reads 'README.md' for long description, and loads setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "flows": "Uses the presence of 'c_monocypher.pyx' to determine whether to compile with Cython or fallback to C, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard package setup tasks without unusual behavior. The version comment hints at dependency management but no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing standard modules and conditionally compiling Cython extensions. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. It does not include code injection, data leaks, or network communication. The use of cryptography libraries appears benign and consistent with its purpose. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It simply prepares the cryptography extension for packaging.",
