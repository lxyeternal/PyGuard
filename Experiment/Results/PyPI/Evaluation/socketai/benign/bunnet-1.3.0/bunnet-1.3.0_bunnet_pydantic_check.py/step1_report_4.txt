{
  "purpose": "The function checks if the installed version of the 'pydantic' library is version 2 or higher.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'pydantic.VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "The code converts the version string to an integer for comparison, but does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Reads version from 'pydantic.VERSION' -> splits string -> converts first segment to int -> compares to 2.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check by parsing the 'pydantic' package's VERSION attribute. There are no external inputs beyond the package attribute, no data leaks, no malicious logic, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is simple and intended for version compatibility checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function to verify the 'pydantic' package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
