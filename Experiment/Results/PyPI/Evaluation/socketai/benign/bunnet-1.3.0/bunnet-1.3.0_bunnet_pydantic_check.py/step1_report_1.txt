  "purpose": "The code determines if the installed version of the 'pydantic' library is version 2 or higher.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'VERSION' attribute from the 'pydantic' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'pydantic.VERSION', splits it, converts the first part to an integer, and compares it to 2.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'pydantic.VERSION', which is a straightforward attribute. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply accesses a public attribute of a third-party library to determine its major version. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute any suspicious logic. The function is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function checking the version of a trusted library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
