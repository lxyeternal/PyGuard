{
  "purpose": "The code checks if the installed version of the 'pydantic' library is version 2 or higher.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' attribute from the 'pydantic' library.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of version string to integer for comparison; no direct sinks for untrusted data or actions.",
  "flows": "Source (pydantic.VERSION) -> split string -> parse first part -> compare integer value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pydantic' library and defines a function to check its version. It accesses 'pydantic.VERSION', splits the string to extract the major version, converts it to an integer, and compares it to see if it is at least 2. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of 'VERSION' attribute is standard for version checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple version check on the 'pydantic' library and does not contain any malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal utility function for compatibility or feature gating.",
