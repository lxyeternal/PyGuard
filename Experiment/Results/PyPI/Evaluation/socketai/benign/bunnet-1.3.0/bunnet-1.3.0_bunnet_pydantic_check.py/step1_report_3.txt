  "purpose": "Check the version of the pydantic library to determine if it is version 2 or higher.",
  "sources": "pydantic.VERSION, which reads the version string of the installed pydantic package.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads the version string from pydantic, splits it, converts the first part to an integer, and compares it to 2.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and performs a simple version check without any suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pydantic library and defines a function that checks whether the installed version of pydantic is at least version 2. It accesses pydantic.VERSION, splits it to extract the major version, converts it to an integer, and compares it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's purpose appears legitimate and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version check of the pydantic library with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and performs a basic comparison operation.",
