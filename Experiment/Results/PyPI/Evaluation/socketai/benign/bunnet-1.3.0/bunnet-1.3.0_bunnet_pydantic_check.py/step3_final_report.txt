  "purpose": "Check if the major version of the pydantic library is at least 2.",
  "sources": "Access to pydantic.VERSION, which is a public attribute providing the version string.",
  "sinks": "The comparison operation that determines if the version is >= 2, which influences behavior based on library version.",
  "flows": "Read pydantic.VERSION -> split string -> convert first segment to int -> compare to 2.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version check. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, direct check of the pydantic library's major version by accessing a public attribute, splitting the version string, converting the first part to an integer, and comparing it to 2. All reports agree that this is a benign, straightforward operation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0). No evidence suggests any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The code relies on the standard format of the version string, which is typical and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version check of the pydantic library. All reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No modifications to the scores or further analysis are necessary.",
