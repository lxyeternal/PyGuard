{
  "purpose": "The code checks if the installed version of the 'pydantic' library is version 2 or higher.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'VERSION' attribute from the 'pydantic' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm; the code performs a benign version check.",
  "flows": "The source 'pydantic.VERSION' flows into a split operation, then into a comparison to determine if the major version is >= 2.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pydantic' library and defines a function to determine if the library's major version is at least 2. It accesses 'pydantic.VERSION', splits it to extract the major version, and compares it to 2. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The use of version checking is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check function without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
