  "conclusion": "The code is a typical migration framework with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious migration scripts loaded dynamically without validation, which could be exploited if the migration files are compromised. Overall, the code itself is safe, but environment security and validation mechanisms should be employed to mitigate supply chain risks."
