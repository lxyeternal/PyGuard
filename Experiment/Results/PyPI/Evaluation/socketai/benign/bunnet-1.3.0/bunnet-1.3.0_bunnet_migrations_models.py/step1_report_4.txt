  "purpose": "Define data models and database document schema for migration logs and related configurations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static models and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for data models using Pydantic and ODM for database documents. It employs standard data structures, such as Enums and data validation, without executing or dynamically executing code. No external inputs, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The usage of default_factory for timestamps is safe and standard. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for migration logs and related models with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application handling migrations, with no evident security risks.",
