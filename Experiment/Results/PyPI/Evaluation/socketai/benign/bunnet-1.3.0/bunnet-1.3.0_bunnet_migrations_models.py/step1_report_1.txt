{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and document structure for migration logs and directions, likely for database migration tracking.",
  "sources": "No external input reading or untrusted data sources present.",
  "targets": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; uses standard library and Pydantic models.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; code primarily defines data schemas with no external communication or data processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or hidden functionality observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries (datetime, enum, typing, pydantic, bunnet). It defines a Document subclass for migration logs, with timestamp defaulting to current time, and an Enum for migration directions. Data models for parsing migration info and modes are straightforward. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a simple data model setup without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for migration tracking, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
