  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface to connect to a MongoDB database and retrieve the client and database objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'uri' and 'db_name' for database connection are received through method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Returning the MongoClient and database objects themselves, which could be used to perform database operations, but no direct security-sensitive actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Method 'set_db' takes 'uri' and 'db_name' and initializes connection; 'get_cli' and 'get_db' retrieve stored objects. No untrusted data flow beyond standard initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No obfuscation or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class methods to set and retrieve MongoDB connection objects. It takes connection details as parameters and stores them as class attributes. No handling of secrets or sensitive data within the code itself, nor any suspicious external calls or obfuscation. It functions as a utility class for database connections, with no malicious or malicious-sounding code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing MongoDB connections. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
