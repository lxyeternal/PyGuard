  "purpose": "A simple class-based utility for establishing and retrieving MongoDB connections using pymongo, accepting external URI and database name parameters.",
  "sources": "External parameters 'uri' and 'db_name' provided to set_db method, used to instantiate MongoClient and select database.",
  "sinks": "MongoClient instance stored as class attribute, database object stored as class attribute; no data transmission or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into set_db, creating MongoClient and database objects; these are retrieved via get_cli and get_db methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation for managing MongoDB connections. It accepts external inputs for connection parameters, which could be misused if untrusted, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions, data processing, or network activity beyond connection setup. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, with minor risk considerations due to external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward database connection utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
