{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple handler for connecting to a MongoDB database using pymongo.",
  "sources": "User provides 'uri' and 'db_name' to establish a connection; methods access class attributes 'client' and 'database'.",
  "sinks": "No immediate data sinks or untrusted data output identified; code mainly manages database connection objects.",
  "flows": "Input 'uri' and 'db_name' flow into 'set_db' to create a MongoClient and assign the database; 'get_cli' and 'get_db' retrieve these objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class methods for establishing and retrieving MongoDB connection objects. It accepts connection parameters from external callers, which are stored as class attributes. There are no embedded secrets, no network activities beyond establishing the connection, and no data exfiltration mechanisms. The implementation appears standard for database connection management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical database connection handler with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on the provided code.",
