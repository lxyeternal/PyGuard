  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface for setting and retrieving MongoDB database connections.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'uri' and 'db_name' for establishing the database connection.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'uri' flows into MongoClient instantiation; 'db_name' is used to access specific database object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; standard use of pymongo.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class methods to set up and retrieve a MongoDB client and database. It accepts external parameters 'uri' and 'db_name', which are used to connect to MongoDB. No data is hardcoded or transmitted elsewhere. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated logic, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, non-malicious implementation for managing MongoDB connections. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
