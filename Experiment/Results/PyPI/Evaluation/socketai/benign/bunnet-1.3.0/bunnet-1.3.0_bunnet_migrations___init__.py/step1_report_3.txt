{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal Python script that imports the 'os' module and prints the current working directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "The source (os.getcwd()) flows into the print() function to display the directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'os' module, retrieves the current working directory with os.getcwd(), and prints it. There are no external inputs, no use of untrusted data, and no indications of malicious behavior. The code is simple and typical for basic scripting purposes. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are observed. The code structure and behavior are transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that outputs the current working directory. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
