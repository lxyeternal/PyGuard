  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code execution points, environment variables, network requests, and data reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, environment variable access, or code execution points like eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input/env variables or code reading functions flow into processing or network transmission points, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or complex logic that deviates from standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal suspicious activity; only Report 1 indicates signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying moderate malware (0.4) and obfuscation (0.6) scores. Other reports are straightforward, benign, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Slight adjustment of Report 2's security risk from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 1 exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting moderate scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, with no significant inconsistencies.",
