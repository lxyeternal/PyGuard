{
  "purpose": "The provided code defines two classes, Forward and Backward, with no implemented methods or attributes, likely serving as placeholders or base classes.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data sources are present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external outputs, or data handling points are evident in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input processing, or output processes in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class declarations with ellipses (...) indicating incomplete implementations; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and appears to be placeholder class definitions without any logic, data processing, or external interactions. The use of ellipses suggests incomplete code or abstract base classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscated code. The absence of functions, data handling, or external calls indicates a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited content, the code shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be structural or placeholder code with no suspicious activity.",
