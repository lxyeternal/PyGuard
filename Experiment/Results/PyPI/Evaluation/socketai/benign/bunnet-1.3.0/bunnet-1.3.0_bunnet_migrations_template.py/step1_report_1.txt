{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two classes, Forward and Backward, with no implementation details provided.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading mechanisms are present in the given code.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between sources and sinks due to the lack of implementation details.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are defined with ellipses ('...'), indicating incomplete or placeholder code, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The absence of actual code prevents detection of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet contains only class declarations with placeholder ellipses, offering no functional or operational details. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observable. The minimal structure and lack of implementation suggest it could be part of a larger codebase, but as-is, it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited and placeholder nature of this code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The code appears incomplete or intentionally minimal. No malicious activity is evident.",
