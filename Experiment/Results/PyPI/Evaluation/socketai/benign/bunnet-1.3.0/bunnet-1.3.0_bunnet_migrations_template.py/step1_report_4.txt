{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, Forward and Backward, without any implementation details, likely as placeholders or part of a larger module.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources such as network, user input, environment variables, or file I/O are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code, such as data leaks, system modifications, or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present within the code snippet since it contains only class declarations without any methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are defined with placeholder syntax ('...'), indicating incomplete implementation. There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious code behavior observable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with placeholder bodies, providing no behavior or logic. The absence of any methods, data handling, or external interactions suggests it is either incomplete or boilerplate code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal and placeholder nature of the code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign and likely part of a larger, incomplete project.",
