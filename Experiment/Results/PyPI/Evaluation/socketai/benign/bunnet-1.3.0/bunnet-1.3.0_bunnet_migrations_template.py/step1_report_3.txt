{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two classes, Forward and Backward, likely intended for some form of data processing or algorithmic operation involving forward and backward directions.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable due to the absence of code within the classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions with placeholder syntax ('...'), indicating incomplete or abstract code. No actual code logic, data handling, or potentially malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class declarations with placeholder ellipses, implying incomplete or intentionally abstracted code. Without further implementation details, there are no observable data flows, inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior. The snippet does not include any code that could be exploited or that demonstrates malicious intent. Given the minimal content, there are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and incomplete, possibly serving as a scaffold for further development.",
