{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, Forward and Backward, with no implementation details, serving as placeholders or scaffolding.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code contains only class declarations with ellipses ('...') indicating incomplete or abstract classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; absence of data flow, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code lacks executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only class declarations with ellipses, indicating placeholder or incomplete code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with ellipses, indicating incomplete or abstract classes. There are no methods, attributes, data flows, or external interactions. The high confidence scores (0.8+) reflect the minimal and benign nature. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are very low (0-0.2), consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities or active code. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. Given the placeholder status, the code is unlikely to contain hidden malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structural placeholder with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified. No modifications are necessary; the overall assessment remains that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
