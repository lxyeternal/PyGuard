      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical migration framework with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious migration scripts loaded dynamically without validation, which could be exploited if the migration files are compromised. Overall, the code itself is safe, but environment security and validation mechanisms should be employed to mitigate supply chain risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for merging dictionaries. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Minor adjustments to the securityRisk scores in some reports to 0 would improve consistency."
