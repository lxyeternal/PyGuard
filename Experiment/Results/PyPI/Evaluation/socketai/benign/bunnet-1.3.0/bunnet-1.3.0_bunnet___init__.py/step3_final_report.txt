  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various components from the 'bunnet' ODM library and defines a version and export list for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'bunnet' modules, version string, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Static import and export setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup file, importing components and defining exports. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.0-0.1), consistent with a benign static module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for exposing 'bunnet' ODM components. No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
