{
  "purpose": "This code imports various components and functions from the 'bunnet' library for object-document mapping (ODM) with MongoDB, including migration controllers, actions, custom types, and configuration classes, and defines module exports.",
  "sources": "All source data are from static import statements importing from 'bunnet' modules; no external input sources or user data are read directly within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data; the code solely defines imports and exports without executing dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code functions as an import and export module without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The version string and __all__ list are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains import statements from the 'bunnet' ODM library, setting the module's version and defining its exported symbols. No user input, data processing, or potentially malicious operations are present. The module appears to be a typical library interface file.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward module setup for 'bunnet' ODM components.",
