  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior. The classes are simple, inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling purposes. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n- **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, indicating certainty in their assessment.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \nSince all reports indicate no malicious activity, no elevated risk scores are justified. The code is purely for exception handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, hidden behavior, or backdoors.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard set of exception class definitions.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.  \n- No obfuscation, data handling, or external interactions are involved.  \n- The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling, which is common and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component appears safe. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is harmless, straightforward, and standard for defining custom exceptions.  \n- No changes to the scores are necessary.  \n- The overall security posture of this code fragment is excellent, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
