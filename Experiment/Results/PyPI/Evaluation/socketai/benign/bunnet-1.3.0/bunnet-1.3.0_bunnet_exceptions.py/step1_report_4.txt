{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various error conditions in a document or collection management system, likely related to a database or data processing library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points are present in this code; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling mechanisms are present; no untrusted data processing or output is performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources and sinks, as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions with no additional logic, which is typical for exception classes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive names indicating various error states related to document, collection, view, and migration management. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions present. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for error handling in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of custom exception classes used for handling specific error scenarios within a database or data management context. There is no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risk present in this snippet.",
