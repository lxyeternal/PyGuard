{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a MongoDB or document management context.",
  "sources": "None of the classes read input or data; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior; only exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present, as this is only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of empty exception class definitions with no additional logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. There are no data inputs, data processing, external calls, or obfuscated patterns. It appears to be a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling in a larger application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The absence of code beyond class declarations indicates minimal risk. The classes are well-structured and serve a clear purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception classes intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security issues. It appears to be safe and standard practice for defining application-specific exceptions.",
