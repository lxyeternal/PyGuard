  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data input, processing, or external interactions. The code appears benign and straightforward.\n\n**Step 2: Identify any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is purely class declarations for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue.**  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which makes sense as there's no obfuscation present.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \nNo issues are present that warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely structural, defining exception classes, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**  \nThe reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions. No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report.**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code's purpose is clear: defining custom exceptions for error handling in a database or document management system.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
