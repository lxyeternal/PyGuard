  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a MongoDB-related application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sources; exception classes are static and do not handle data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for control flow but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The classes are simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. These classes are named to reflect various error states in a database or document management context. No data input, output, or processing occurs within these classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for error handling. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions intended for error handling and contains no malicious behavior. It does not pose a security threat.",
