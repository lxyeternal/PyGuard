  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a MongoDB or document management system to handle specific error cases.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class definitions of exception types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this is solely a list of exception class definitions without any runtime execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, used to represent various error conditions. There are no data sources, sinks, or flow logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The purpose appears to be to provide descriptive exception handling for a MongoDB or document management context. The structure and content do not suggest obfuscation or malware. Overall, this is a benign, standard pattern of defining custom exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves to improve error handling in a larger application context. No security risks or malware behavior identified.",
