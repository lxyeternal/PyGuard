  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only consists of simple, straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data input/output, external calls, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is standard practice for error handling in Python applications, especially in database or document management contexts.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or reasoning flaws:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify that the code is harmless.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that are unsupported by the code.\n- The reasoning is sound: defining exception classes does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk associated with class definitions alone)\n\n**Final note:** The code snippet is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
