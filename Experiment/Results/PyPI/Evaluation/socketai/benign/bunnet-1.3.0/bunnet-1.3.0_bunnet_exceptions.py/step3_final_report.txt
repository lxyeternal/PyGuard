  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a document or database management system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no external data inputs or dynamic behavior.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "None; purely class declarations with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no additional logic or data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no embedded logic, data, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of these classes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
