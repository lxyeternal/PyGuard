  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a MongoDB-related application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions without any dynamic or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed exclusively of custom exception class declarations, which are used for handling various error conditions in a MongoDB or document management context. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or suspicious behaviors. All classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class and serve to categorize specific error types. The absence of code execution, data handling, or external interactions indicates no malicious intent or security risks. The simplicity and straightforward nature of this code reduce the likelihood of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of custom exception classes intended for error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment. The code appears benign and solely focused on defining error types.",
