  "purpose": "Recursive merge of two dictionaries, updating nested dictionaries as needed.",
  "sources": "u.items() for input dictionary u, d.get(k, {}) for existing nested dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to d[k], recursive call to update_dict, updating nested dictionaries.",
  "flows": "u.items() -> isinstance check -> recursive call or assignment to d[k].",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward recursive merge.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard recursive dictionary merge, updating dictionary d with values from u, including nested dictionaries. It does not contain obfuscation, external network calls, or malicious constructs. The logic is clear and predictable, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports mostly reflect the benign nature, though some securityRisk scores of 0.1 could be lowered to 0 for more accuracy, as the function itself poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for merging dictionaries. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Minor adjustments to the securityRisk scores in some reports to 0 would improve consistency.",
