  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for merging dictionaries. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Minor adjustments to the securityRisk scores in some reports to 0 would improve consistency."
