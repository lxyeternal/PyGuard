{
  "purpose": "This module consolidates and re-exports various operator classes from the 'bunnet.odm.operators' modules for MongoDB query and update operations, serving as an organized API interface within the 'bunnet' ODM library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static import statements importing classes/functions from 'bunnet.odm.operators' submodules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from modules and then exposes them via the __all__ list; there are no runtime data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the duplicate entry of 'Type' in the __all__ list, which is benign but could be cleaned up.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative module that imports various operator classes for MongoDB queries and updates and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The duplicate 'Type' entry is a minor redundancy but does not impact security. The overall structure is straightforward and standard for a library's export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely organizational, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
