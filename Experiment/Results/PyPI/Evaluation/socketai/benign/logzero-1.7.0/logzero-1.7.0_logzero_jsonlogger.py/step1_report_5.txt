{
  "purpose": "Provides custom JSON-formatted log formatting for Python logging, enabling structured log output with extended customization options.",
  "sources": "Reads data from logging.LogRecord attributes, imported modules, environment variables, and potentially external input via logging calls.",
  "sinks": "Outputs serialized JSON log strings. The code itself does not directly write to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Extracts log record data, merges extra attributes, formats datetime and traceback objects, serializes to JSON, and outputs as a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious external connections, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Usage of importlib to dynamically import functions is safe given controlled inputs, but could be risky if misused in an untrusted environment. The code is primarily a standard logging formatter with JSON serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom JSON serialization and formatting for logging records, including handling of datetime, traceback, and exceptions. It imports modules dynamically but only via importlib with explicit module paths, which is standard and safe. No evidence of data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network activity. The main functions process log data, merge extra attributes, and serialize logs; all are intended for safe logging purposes. No suspicious anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured JSON log formatter for Python logging and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard utility module for log formatting with safe practices and no indications of sabotage or malware.",
