  "sinks": "No sinks present; the script does not send data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading files ('README.md' and 'HISTORY.md') to compile the long description during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is standard setup.py boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads documentation files and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no code injections, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious routines, or anomalous data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package setup functions only.",
