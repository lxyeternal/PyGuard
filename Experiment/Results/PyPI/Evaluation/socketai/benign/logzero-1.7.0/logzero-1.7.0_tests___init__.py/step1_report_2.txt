  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to sensitive or untrusted areas are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident due to the minimal content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; only a file encoding declaration and a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a simple comment indicating it is a unit test package for logzero. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or third-party interactions that could indicate malicious intent. The minimal content suggests this is boilerplate or initial file setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, harmless header for a test package.",
