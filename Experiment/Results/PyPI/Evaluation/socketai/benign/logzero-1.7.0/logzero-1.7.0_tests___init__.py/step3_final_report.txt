  "purpose": "Minimal placeholder or documentation stub for a unit test package, containing only encoding declaration and a descriptive docstring.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment and a docstring, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows exist in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, non-executable module with only a coding declaration and a docstring. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, placeholder nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements. The confidence level is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or security concerns are detected, and the code does not pose any threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or documentation stub with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
