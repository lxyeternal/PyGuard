{
  "purpose": "The code defines ANSI escape sequences and classes for styling terminal output, including cursor control, foreground and background colors, and styles.",
  "sources": "Constants and methods that generate ANSI escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions return escape sequences that are used to control terminal behavior; no untrusted input is directly used in these functions.",
  "flows": "The code constructs escape sequences from constants and parameters, which are then used by terminal applications to control output formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present. All methods generate standard ANSI escape sequences; no obfuscation or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling and cursor movement. It uses fixed constants and class attributes to define styles and colors. No external input is processed or sanitized, and no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The classes encapsulate ANSI codes and provide methods to generate control sequences, which are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of terminal styling utilities using ANSI escape sequences. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, legitimate library for terminal formatting.",
