{
  "purpose": "Provide ANSI escape sequences for text formatting and cursor control in terminal outputs.",
  "sources": "The code defines functions and classes that generate ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal text, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code solely generates escape sequences based on fixed inputs or class attributes.",
  "flows": "The code creates escape sequences from fixed values and class attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution present. The code strictly generates terminal escape sequences with predefined constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for control characters, functions to generate escape sequences, and classes encapsulating color and style codes. It initializes objects for foreground, background, style, and cursor control. There is no data input processing, network communication, or environment variable usage. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for terminal styling. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating terminal ANSI escape sequences, intended for terminal text styling and cursor movement. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
