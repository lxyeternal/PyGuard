{
  "purpose": "Define ANSI escape sequences and classes for terminal text styling, cursor movement, and screen manipulation.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that generate ANSI escape sequences, class attributes defining color and style codes.",
  "sinks": "The functions and methods that return escape sequences, which can be used to control terminal output; no direct untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Function calls generate escape sequences; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all code is static, defining sequences and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code consists of standard terminal control sequences and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen control. It uses standard escape sequences, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The classes and functions are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The overall implementation appears to be a utility library for terminal control, with no network activity, data leakage, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for terminal styling and control, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
