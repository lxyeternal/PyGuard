{
  "purpose": "Provides ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, cursor movement, and screen manipulation.",
  "sources": "Defines constants and functions that generate ANSI escape sequences, and classes that instantiate styled ANSI codes.",
  "sinks": "Returns string sequences that, when printed, control terminal display; no external data sinks or network connections present.",
  "flows": "Functions and class methods generate escape sequences directly; no user input or untrusted data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity. The code simply generates terminal control sequences and styled text sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences used for styling terminal output, cursor movement, and screen clearing. It uses straightforward string concatenation and class attribute initialization. The code structure is standard, with no indications of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated behavior. No suspicious imports, network calls, or hidden mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for terminal styling and control sequences, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is purely for formatting terminal output.",
