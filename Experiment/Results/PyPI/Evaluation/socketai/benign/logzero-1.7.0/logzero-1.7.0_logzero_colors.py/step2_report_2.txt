  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor control, and screen clearing.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or network activity are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code relies solely on fixed constants, class attributes, and simple string concatenation.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The functions and classes correctly generate ANSI escape sequences based on fixed constants and parameters.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code attempts to execute external commands, read sensitive data, or manipulate the environment.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Security risks:** The code is purely for generating terminal control sequences, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-specific analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; defines functions and classes for ANSI sequences.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data flows; sequences are generated from constants.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Correct; the code is safe, standard, and well-understood.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n\n- Same as above; consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n\n- Same reasoning; no issues detected.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n\n- Again, consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n\n- Same conclusion; no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Note:** No report suggests any reason to assign higher scores. The code is a utility library for terminal styling, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**All scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and poses no security risks.",
