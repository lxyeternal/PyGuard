  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of ANSI escape sequence generators for terminal styling, cursor control, and screen clearing.\n- They note that no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected.\n- The code is purely a utility library with no malicious intent.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n\n- The code defines constants for control characters.\n- Functions generate escape sequences based on fixed parameters or class attributes.\n- Classes encapsulate ANSI codes for foreground, background, style, and cursor control.\n- No input processing, network communication, or environment-dependent behavior is present.\n- The code is static and deterministic.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code appears well-structured and standard for its purpose.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n- No adjustments needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n\n- Since all evidence points to a benign utility library with no malicious or suspicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The malware score should be 0.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they only analyze the code's actual behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities are claimed based on assumptions.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented utility for terminal styling.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)  \n**Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and poses no security concerns.",
