  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen control.",
  "sources": "Constants defining control characters; class attributes for ANSI codes; functions generating escape sequences based on fixed parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "Generation of escape sequences from fixed constants and class attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility library for terminal styling using ANSI escape sequences. It defines constants, functions, and classes that generate escape sequences based on fixed parameters or class attributes. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data input, and no network activity. The implementation is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform any external operations, or contain hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for terminal styling with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
