{
  "purpose": "This code provides ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attributes defining ANSI codes; function parameters for color and position settings.",
  "sinks": "None directly; functions generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, position values) are concatenated with escape sequence strings to produce control sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present. Usage of standard ANSI sequences for terminal control.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants, utility functions, and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for text styling and cursor control. The class AnsiCodes initializes attributes with escape sequences based on predefined codes. No untrusted data sources, external input, or network operations are present. The code does not perform any file I/O, data transmission, or system modification. The structure is straightforward, with clear separation of functionalities, and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal text formatting and cursor movement. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
