  "purpose": "The code manages static asset files for a Sphinx extension, including copying assets and injecting static files into the build.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS_PROJECT, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), configuration values, and static file paths.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations, asset injection into the Sphinx app, and path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> configuration setup -> static files selected based on config -> copying assets -> injecting static files into Sphinx build.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Path manipulations are straightforward. Use of environment variables is standard, not malicious. No code injection or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines asset file collections. It includes functions to retrieve static files based on configuration, prepare context for templates, copy asset files, and inject static assets into the Sphinx documentation build process. The 'copy_asset_files' function conditionally processes files ending with '_t' as templates, which is a common pattern and uses 'copy_asset' for file operations. Environment variables are used to set project and version info but are not directly used in unsafe operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are detected. The logic is straightforward and intended for static file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing static assets in a Sphinx extension without any malicious intent or security risks. No indicators of malware or supply chain attacks are evident. It operates within expected patterns for such extensions.",
