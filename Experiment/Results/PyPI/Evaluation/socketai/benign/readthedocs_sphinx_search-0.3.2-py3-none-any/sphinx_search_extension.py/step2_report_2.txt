  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code manages static assets for a Sphinx extension in a standard way.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 1. This aligns with the code's straightforward static asset management purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes standard practices—reading environment variables, copying files, injecting assets—without malicious behaviors.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 (minimal, likely due to environment variable use), confidence 1.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard static asset handling with no signs of malicious code. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1), possibly because environment variables are used in configuration.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical extension code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings—asset management based on configuration, environment variables used only for context, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2 (still low), confidence 1.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports—standard static asset inclusion, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward static asset management for a Sphinx extension.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; no obfuscated code, no network activity, no suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; minimal use of environment variables for configuration, typical for build scripts.\n- **Flow of data:** All flows are standard—configuration and environment variables influence static file selection and copying.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not process untrusted user input or perform unsafe operations.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature and purpose, a **0.1 to 0.2** is reasonable, primarily because environment variables are used in configuration, but this is standard and not malicious.\n- **Overall estimate:** I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (low, typical for build scripts relying on environment variables)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard static asset handler for a Sphinx extension with no malicious intent or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
