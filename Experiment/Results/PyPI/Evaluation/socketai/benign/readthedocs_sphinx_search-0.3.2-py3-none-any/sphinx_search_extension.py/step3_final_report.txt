  "purpose": "Manage static assets (CSS/JS) for a Sphinx extension, including copying files and injecting them into documentation based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (rtd_sphinx_search_file_type, environment variables), static asset files in the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Copying asset files to output directory, injecting CSS/JS files into the build process.",
  "flows": "Configuration and environment variables influence which assets are selected; files are copied and injected during build; no untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard static asset management for a Sphinx extension. It reads configuration and environment variables to determine which assets to include, copies static files during build, and injects CSS/JS files accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flow. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical in build systems. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or external network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static asset handler for a Sphinx extension, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and reflect the benign behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
