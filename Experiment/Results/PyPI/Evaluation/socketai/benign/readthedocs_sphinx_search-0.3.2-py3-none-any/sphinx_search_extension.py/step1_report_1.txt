{
  "purpose": "The code manages static asset files for a Sphinx extension, including copying and injecting CSS/JS files based on configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Configuration values such as app.config, environment variables (READTHEDOCS_PROJECT, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), and static file paths.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations (`copy_asset`) and addition of JS/CSS files to the Sphinx app (`app.add_js_file`, `app.add_css_file`).",
  "flows": "Configuration values and environment variables influence which static files are selected and copied or injected; no untrusted data directly modifies system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of environment variables is standard for configuration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard static asset management for a Sphinx documentation extension. It reads configuration values, environment variables, and file paths, then copies files and injects assets into the build process. The code validates the file type, constructs paths securely, and manages template files with context. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or unauthorized network activity are present. All operations are typical for a Sphinx extension managing static assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, focused on static asset handling for documentation purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
