  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx extension component managing static assets (CSS/JS).\n- It reads configuration, environment variables, and static files.\n- It copies files during build and injects assets into the documentation.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is evident.\n- Use of environment variables is typical for build context, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward static asset management.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's reasoning aligns with the code.  \n- No issues found.  \n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard asset handling, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent with the code.  \n- No signs of malicious intent or security risks.  \n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), mentions environment variables and static files, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) due to environment variables, but these are standard.  \n- No malware detected, and no suspicious code behavior.  \n- The small security risk might be due to environment variable reliance, but this is typical.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No reason to increase malware score.  \n- The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing configuration, environment variables, and static file handling.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2), perhaps reflecting cautiousness about environment variables.  \n- Still, no malicious activity or backdoors.  \n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Similar, with emphasis on standard practices, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully aligned with the code.  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (up to 0.2), justified by reliance on environment variables, but this is common and not inherently risky.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to environment variables influencing behavior, but this is standard in build environments)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical static asset handler for a Sphinx extension, with no signs of supply chain or malicious security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is legitimate and safe.  \n- No changes needed to the existing scores.  \n- The overall risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a very low security risk (around 0.1–0.2) due to environment variable use, which is standard practice.",
