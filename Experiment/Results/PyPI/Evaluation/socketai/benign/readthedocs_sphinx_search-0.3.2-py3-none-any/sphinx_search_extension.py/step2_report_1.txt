  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code manages static assets (CSS/JS) for a Sphinx extension.\n- It reads configuration values and environment variables to determine which assets to include.\n- Files are copied during the build process, and assets are injected into the documentation.\n- No user input is directly processed, and environment variables are standard for build context.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present.\n- The code appears to follow standard patterns for Sphinx extensions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms standard static asset management; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Justification:** The logic is straightforward, no suspicious activity, no untrusted data processing.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1; standard static asset handling with no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also confirms standard static asset management, with mention of environment variables influencing configuration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Observation:** Slightly elevated risk score due to environment variables, but these are standard and not inherently risky.\n- **Justification:** Environment variables are used for configuration, not malicious purposes.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable. No evidence of malicious activity. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports; no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Observation:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to reliance on environment variables and file handling.\n- **Justification:** Still within normal bounds for a build system; environment variables are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, standard static asset management, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flow.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 and 0.2) are justified given the use of environment variables, but these are standard in build systems and do not indicate security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to environment variables, but within acceptable bounds for build scripts.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical static asset handler for a Sphinx extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No modifications to the scores are necessary. The reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.",
