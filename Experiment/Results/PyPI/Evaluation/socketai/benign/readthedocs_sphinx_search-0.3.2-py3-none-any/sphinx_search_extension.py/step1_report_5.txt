{
  "purpose": "The code manages the inclusion of static assets (CSS/JS files) in a Sphinx documentation build, with support for different file types and templates, and copies assets post-build.",
  "sources": "Configuration values from `app.config`, environment variables `READTHEDOCS_PROJECT` and `READTHEDOCS_VERSION`",
  "sinks": "File copying operations in `copy_asset_files`, adding JS/CSS files to the Sphinx app via `app.add_js_file` and `app.add_css_file`",
  "flows": "Configuration variables and environment variables influence which files are included; `_get_static_files` determines asset files; `copy_asset_files` copies static assets; `inject_static_files` registers files for inclusion in the build",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file operations, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on standard Sphinx extension mechanisms and straightforward file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script defines asset files and manages their inclusion and copying during the documentation build. It dynamically selects assets based on configuration, supports templating for assets ending with '_t', and reads environment variables for project/version info. The use of `copy_asset` appears to be standard file copying. No input sources handle untrusted user data; environment variables are standard for build context. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious logic is evident. The code uses normal extension hooks to insert assets and copy files, consistent with typical Sphinx extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Sphinx extension component for managing static assets. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward and safe within the context of a documentation build process.",
