  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\n__version__ = '0.3.2'\n```\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports describe this code as a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, no data flows, no external interactions, and no obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are all at 1.0, indicating high certainty that the code is harmless.\n- Malware scores are 0.0 across all reports, aligning with the benign assessment.\n- The security risk scores are also 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code is a simple version string assignment. No inputs, outputs, or logic are present.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** The reports correctly identify it as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of reasoning and scores:\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- The malware score of 0.0 is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- The security risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, no changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The high confidence and consistent scoring across reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0.",
