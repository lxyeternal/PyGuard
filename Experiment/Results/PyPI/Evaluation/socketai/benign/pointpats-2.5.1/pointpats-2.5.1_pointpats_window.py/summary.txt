  "conclusion": "The code is a benign spatial analysis utility module with standard functions and class definitions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the processing of external points but does not indicate any threat. The malware score remains 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk is negligible. This code can be considered safe for use."
