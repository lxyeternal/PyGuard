{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for geometric shape analysis, spatial querying, and hull construction, supporting various geometry libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads from shape objects (attributes, methods, or external libraries), input coordinates, and configuration parameters such as 'hull'.",
  "sinks": "Uses shape methods (contains, centroid, area, bounds) that could be manipulated if shape objects are maliciously crafted; creates spatial trees; constructs hulls; queries trees for neighbors.",
  "flows": "Input data (shapes, coordinates) flow into dispatch functions and methods, which may invoke external libraries; data may be used in spatial queries and hull construction; no direct data leaks or external network calls are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of warnings for performance is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious obfuscation patterns. External library imports are conditional but do not suggest malicious intent. The code does not include any data exfiltration or harmful system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements geometry-related utility functions with support for multiple libraries (numpy, scipy, shapely, scikit-learn). It uses dispatch functions to handle different shape types and constructs spatial trees and hulls for geometric analysis. Conditional imports and library version checks are standard for compatibility. No code indicates malicious behavior such as network activity, system modifications, or data theft. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The functions perform standard geometric computations and spatial data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of spatial geometry utilities without malicious intent. It manages external dependencies responsibly, and all operations are typical for geographic data processing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
