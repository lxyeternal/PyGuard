{
  "purpose": "Provides geometric shape analysis, spatial queries, and spatial structure construction for spatial data processing.",
  "sources": "Shape input parameters (e.g., shape objects, coordinate arrays), external spatial libraries (numpy, scipy, shapely, scikit-learn).",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or insecure data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Shape data flows into functions like area, bbox, contains, centroid, and hull construction; spatial trees are built for neighbor queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard spatial analysis techniques, handles optional dependencies gracefully, and uses dispatch patterns appropriately. No malicious or backdoor code is evident. It performs geometric calculations and spatial indexing in a typical, benign manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured spatial utility library with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. The code's purpose and implementation are consistent with safe, open-source spatial data processing.",
