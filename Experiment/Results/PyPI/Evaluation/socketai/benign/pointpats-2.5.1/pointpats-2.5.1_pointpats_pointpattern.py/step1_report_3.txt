{
  "purpose": "The code defines a PointPattern class for managing, analyzing, and visualizing 2D spatial point data, including spatial statistics and geometric computations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'points' parameter during initialization, which populates the pandas DataFrame; attributes like 'marks' can be added via add_marks().",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections or file writes are present; no untrusted data is directed to external systems or storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'points' into the DataFrame, through spatial computations (e.g., hull, mbb), and into visualization functions. No external untrusted data sources or outputs are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, libpysal) is typical for spatial analysis. No obfuscated code or misleading dynamic execution detected. The code structure is standard, with no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical spatial analysis operations with well-established libraries. No suspicious data manipulation, network activity, or system access is evident. It contains no code that could be used maliciously to exfiltrate data, execute arbitrary code, or harm the system. The import of 'sys' to determine Python version is benign. No hidden or obfuscated behavior was observed. All functions and methods perform standard computations related to spatial data management, visualization, and analysis. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard spatial point pattern analysis class with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of spatial data processing and visualization. No malware indicators or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
