  "purpose": "A spatial point pattern class for analyzing 2D point data, including spatial statistics, visualization, and neighborhood queries.",
  "sources": "Input points array, internal pandas DataFrame, optional window object, and mark data.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions; no external data transmission or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into DataFrame, then through spatial analysis methods; no external sinks or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard spatial point pattern class, performing typical spatial computations and visualizations without network activity or code injection. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of common libraries and lack of external data leaks support a benign assessment. Minor implementation details, such as the try-except in set_window, do not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured spatial analysis class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
