  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of spatial point process simulation routines. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified primarily due to warning suppression practices, which are common and not indicative of malicious activity."
