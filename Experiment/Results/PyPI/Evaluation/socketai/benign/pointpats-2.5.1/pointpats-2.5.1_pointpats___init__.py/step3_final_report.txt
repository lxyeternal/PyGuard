  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from .module import *) which can obscure imported content but is common in package init files",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing various submodules and setting a version string. No external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Wildcard imports are used, which can hide imported functions or classes, but this is typical in package initialization files and does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The overall structure and content are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution but is standard practice in such files and does not imply malicious intent.",
