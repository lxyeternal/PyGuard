  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the code is just setting a version and importing modules.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The use of wildcard imports (from .module import *) can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code, but this is typical in package init files.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Given the lack of malicious activity and the standard nature, the security risk score seems slightly high; perhaps 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?** Not applicable; score is 0.2, which is low.\n- **Malware?** No evidence.\n- **Assumptions?** No assumptions made about vulnerabilities.\n- **Consistency?** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup.\n- Scores are even higher confidence, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk score?** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion?** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; straightforward module setup.\n- Scores are maximal confidence, zero malware.\n- **Risk score?** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard import structure, no external data handling.\n- Scores are maximal confidence, zero malware.\n- **Risk score?** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more detailed, but still only module imports and version setting.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Conclusion?** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues?** No, all reports confirm the code is just setting a version and importing modules.\n- **Malicious activity?** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores?** The scores assigned are generally appropriate, with most being zero or very low. The only minor point is the risk scores of 0.2 or 0.1, which are acceptable given the wildcard imports, but in the absence of actual malicious code, these could be lowered slightly to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Wildcard imports are a common practice in package `__init__.py` files to expose API components, but they can obscure imported content. Still, they are not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0              |\n\nThe code appears benign, standard for a Python package's initialization, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
