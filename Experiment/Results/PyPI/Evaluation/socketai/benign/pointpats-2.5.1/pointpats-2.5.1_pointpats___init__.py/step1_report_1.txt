  "purpose": "Define module version and import various submodules and functions related to point pattern analysis, window operations, and statistical computations.",
  "sources": "Module metadata (__version__) and import statements for submodules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling detected in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and sets version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from .centrography import *, etc.) which can obscure imported content; no explicit suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of setting a version string and importing several submodules and functions. The wildcard imports could be used to hide unwanted or malicious code, but without seeing the imported modules' content, this cannot be confirmed. No data processing, network operations, or code execution based on external input is present. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, focusing on exposing API components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's initialization, with no evident malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution, but no malicious intent can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
