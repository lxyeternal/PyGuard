  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and security risks, and verifying the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initialization script, mainly importing submodules and setting a version string.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- The use of wildcard imports (from .module import *) is noted, which can obscure imported content but is common in package __init__.py files.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific report reviews:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Wildcard imports could hide malicious code, but none is evident here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (due to wildcard imports).  \n- **Assessment:** The score for malware and obfuscated code is appropriate. The security risk is low but not zero because wildcard imports can sometimes be exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup with wildcard imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Given the absence of suspicious activity, these scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard package init code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (small risk due to wildcard imports).  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score reflects the wildcard imports' potential, but overall minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low, justified by the wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, due to wildcard imports which can obscure imported content but are common in package init files.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects the wildcard import practice, which, while not inherently malicious, can sometimes hide issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a very low security risk score (~0.1), and no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
