{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module imports for a spatial analysis or geospatial library, establishing versioning and importing various submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads only the __version__ variable and imports functions and classes from local submodules.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only sets version information and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. All imports are from local modules; no external network operations or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, which is standard practice. It then imports several submodules related to spatial and statistical operations. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The structure is straightforward, focusing on defining module dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
