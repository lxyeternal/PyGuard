{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module that imports various functions and classes from local submodules related to point pattern analysis, spatial-temporal processing, and statistical methods.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from internal module imports, primarily from the current package's submodules such as pointpattern, window, centrography, process, quadrat_statistics, distance_statistics, spacetime, and kde.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where external data might be sent, stored, or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks are present; the code only imports internal functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports multiple modules and functions relevant to spatial and statistical analysis. All imports are from local modules; there are no network calls, file I/O, or data processing visible. The structure indicates a library setup, not runtime logic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard library module setup, importing various functionalities for spatial and statistical analyses.",
