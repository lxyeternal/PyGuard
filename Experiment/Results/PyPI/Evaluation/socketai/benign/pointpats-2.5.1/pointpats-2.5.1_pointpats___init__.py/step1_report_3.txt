  "sinks": "No data output, data leaks, or untrusted data handling points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code solely imports modules and functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists only of a version declaration and import statements; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure is straightforward: it sets a version and imports several modules. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external communication occurs. It appears to be a standard initialization script for a package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a simple module setup script for a larger package. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are minimal.",
