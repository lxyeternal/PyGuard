  "purpose": "The code provides functions to simulate various types of spatial point processes within a specified geometric hull, including Poisson, normal, and clustered processes. It supports random point generation within shapes and clusters, useful for spatial statistical analysis and modeling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include 'hull' (geometry), 'size', 'intensity', 'center', 'cov', 'n_seeds', and 'cluster_radius', which are read at the start of functions; numpy.random.uniform and numpy.random.multivariate_normal are used as sources of untrusted data for random number generation.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored in numpy arrays; no data output or external network operations are present. No sinks such as file I/O, network connections, or environment variable usage are identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through parsing and conditional logic to generate spatial point data; random functions generate the points within specified geometric constraints, and results are stored in arrays. There are no indications of untrusted data flow beyond random number generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code uses standard numpy and spatial computations without obfuscation. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are detected. The import of numpy is standard; no malicious code is found within utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on spatial point process simulations with functions for Poisson, normal, and clustered processes, utilizing numpy for randomness and geometric containment checks. The functions appear to implement standard statistical simulation procedures, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The random number generation is confined to valid geometric bounds, and no external data or network operations are involved. The import of a local module '.geometry' is typical for spatial computations and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions. The code appears to be well-structured, with clear parameters and safeguards against typical misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a spatial point process simulation library intended for statistical modeling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It uses standard libraries and techniques, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The functions are designed for legitimate spatial data simulation purposes.",
