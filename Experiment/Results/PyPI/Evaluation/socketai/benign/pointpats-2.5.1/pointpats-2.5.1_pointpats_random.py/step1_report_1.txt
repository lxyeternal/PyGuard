  "purpose": "This code provides functions for simulating spatial point processes (Poisson, normal, cluster processes) within specified geometries for statistical analysis or modeling in spatial statistics or ecology.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'hull', 'size', 'intensity', 'cov', 'center', 'cluster_radius', and 'n_seeds'. It also reads data from numpy.random functions for point generation, and spatial geometry functions (_contains, _bbox, _area, spatial.distance.pdist).",
  "sinks": "Generated points are stored in numpy arrays; no direct data leakage points are present. No sinks seem to process untrusted external input beyond the input parameters, which are used for random sampling and geometric checks.",
  "flows": "Sources (input parameters and random number generators) flow into point generation functions. The functions check geometries and generate points within specified hulls. Results flow into numpy arrays representing spatial realizations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code uses 'numpy.random' without seeding, which is standard for stochastic simulations but could lead to reproducibility issues. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No evidence of obfuscation or hidden code. All functions are straightforward implementations of spatial point process simulations. No external network connections or data exfiltration code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a spatial statistics module generating point patterns within geometries, using numpy for random sampling and spatial geometry checks. It includes functions for Poisson, normal, and cluster point processes, with geometry preparation and validation. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The random number generation is standard and used appropriately. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions operate solely to generate spatial data based on provided parameters, with no external communication or security-critical operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward spatial point process simulation library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be intended for statistical spatial analysis. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
