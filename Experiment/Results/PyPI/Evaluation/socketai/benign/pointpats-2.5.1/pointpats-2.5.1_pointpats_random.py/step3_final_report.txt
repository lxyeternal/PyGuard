  "purpose": "This code provides functions to simulate spatial point processes, including Poisson, normal, and clustered processes, within specified geometries for statistical or ecological modeling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as hull geometry, size, intensity, and distribution parameters; geometric functions (_contains, _area, _bbox); numpy.random for point generation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; data flows from input parameters through geometric checks and random sampling into numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → geometric validation and calculations → random point generation within hull → output arrays of points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication observed. Use of numpy.random without seeding affects reproducibility but not security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward spatial point process simulation library, employing standard numpy and geometric functions. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The functions generate points within geometries based on specified distributions, with input validation and geometric containment checks. The absence of external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation indicates benign intent. Minor reproducibility concerns due to RNG seeding are not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial simulation library with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores (around 0.1) are justified, primarily reflecting the potential for misuse if parameters are maliciously set, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
