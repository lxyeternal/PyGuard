{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to plot kernel density estimates (KDE) for 2D point data, supporting multiple backends and customizable plotting options.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (array or geopandas object), imports from numpy, statsmodels, KDEpy, and matplotlib, and dynamically imports these modules within functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses data for density calculations and plotting; no direct untrusted data sinks that perform insecure operations like system commands, file writing, or network transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed and passed to KDE functions; results are used to generate mesh grids and plotted via matplotlib's contour functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard for KDE plotting with proper import handling and validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Import handling is dynamic but within typical usage. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles input data, performs KDE computations using standard libraries, and plots the results with matplotlib. Import errors are handled gracefully. No data leakage, malicious data handling, or suspicious code flows are evident. The function appears to be a legitimate visualization tool with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard KDE plotting utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It relies on well-known libraries for data processing and visualization. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
