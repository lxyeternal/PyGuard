{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to plot kernel density estimates (KDE) for spatial point data, supporting both statsmodels and KDEpy implementations, with visualization via matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Reads data input for spatial coordinates, imports 'statsmodels.api', 'KDEpy.FFTKDE', and 'matplotlib.pyplot'. It also imports 'numpy' at the start.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported modules to perform calculations and generate plots; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variables manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter through processing and into the KDE estimation functions, then to matplotlib plotting functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code dynamically imports libraries based on parameters, but this is standard practice. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules, including numpy and conditional imports for statsmodels, KDEpy, and matplotlib, based on user parameters. It validates input data types and geometries, then computes KDE estimates using either statsmodels or KDEpy, depending on the 'kernel' parameter. The function creates a spatial grid, computes the density, and plots the result using contour or filled contours. The code includes input validation, error handling for missing libraries, and flexible parameters for resolution, margin, and plot styling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and all library usage appears standard for spatial density plotting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard spatial KDE plotting utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs legitimate data processing and visualization tasks without engaging in harmful actions. The import structure and data handling are typical for such plotting functions, with no suspicious anomalies.",
