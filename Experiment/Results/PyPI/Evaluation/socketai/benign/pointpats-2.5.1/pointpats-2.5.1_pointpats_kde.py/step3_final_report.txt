{
  "purpose": "A spatial KDE plotting utility supporting multiple backends, designed to visualize point data with customizable parameters.",
  "sources": "Data input from numpy arrays or geopandas objects; dynamic imports for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through KDE computations (statsmodels or KDEpy) to matplotlib plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard error handling for imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard KDE visualization with optional dependencies handled via dynamic imports, includes validation for spatial data, and uses matplotlib for plotting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import pattern is typical for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's operations are purely computational and visualization-oriented, with no network or system modification activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial KDE plotting utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain security issues. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
