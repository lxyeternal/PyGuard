  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of spatial statistical functions for point pattern analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily limited to the potential misuse of random point generation in an adversarial context, which is inherent to the analysis domain. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low but non-zero potential for misuse in a malicious setting."
