{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for spatial statistical analysis using Ripley's functions (F, G, J, K, L) on point pattern data, supporting statistical testing and simulation-based inference.",
  "sources": "Reads input coordinates from geopandas objects or numpy arrays; uses imported functions for geometric processing and random point generation; processes optional parameters such as support, distances, hull, and edge correction.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or manipulates data in numpy arrays and warnings; no explicit data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input coordinates through preprocessing (_prepare), into statistical functions (f, g, j, k, l), and then into testing functions (_ripley_test). Simulations generate random points via poisson, and distances are computed through _build_best_tree and _k_neighbors, with results interpolated and combined for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Warnings are used for deprecated or incomplete features like edge correction. The code performs standard spatial statistical computations without hidden code or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated language features are present. There are no network calls, file I/O, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of Ripley's spatial functions, with proper parameter validation and standard warnings for deprecated or incomplete features. It utilizes external libraries (geopandas, numpy, shapely, scipy) in typical ways, and includes robust handling for input data types and shapes. The simulation routines generate random point patterns for statistical testing, consistent with typical spatial analysis workflows. No indicators of malicious intent, such as hidden data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or harmful logic; it appears to be a well-structured scientific analysis module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial statistical analysis toolkit implementing Ripley's functions and associated tests. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It operates solely on input data, performing statistical computations and simulations in a standard manner. The overall security risk is very low.",
