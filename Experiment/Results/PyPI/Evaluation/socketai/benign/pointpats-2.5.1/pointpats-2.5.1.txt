It performs in-memory statistical tests and visualization without external communication or system modification. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 due to the deprecation warning, which is benign."

The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the processing of external points but does not indicate any threat. The malware score remains 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk is negligible. This code can be considered safe for use."

The overall security risk is minimal, primarily limited to the potential misuse of random point generation in an adversarial context, which is inherent to the analysis domain. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low but non-zero potential for misuse in a malicious setting."

The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified primarily due to warning suppression practices, which are common and not indicative of malicious activity."
