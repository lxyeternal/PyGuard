{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator for caching property values in classes to optimize repeated computations.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'cached_property' reads the function 'fun' it decorates, and accesses 'self._cache' within the 'get' method.",
  "sinks": "Potential access to 'self._cache' which could be used insecurely if manipulated, but no external sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator retrieves or initializes 'self._cache' and stores the result of 'fun(self)' in it, then returns cached or computed value.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident. The caching mechanism is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a caching mechanism for class properties, avoiding recomputation by storing results in 'self._cache'. It handles missing cache attribute and key errors gracefully. No external input, network activity, or obfuscated behavior detected. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a cached property decorator with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as intended to improve performance by caching property values.",
