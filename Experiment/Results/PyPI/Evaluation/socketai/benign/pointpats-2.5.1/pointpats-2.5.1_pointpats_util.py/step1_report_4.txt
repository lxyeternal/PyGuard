  "purpose": "Implement a cached_property decorator for class properties to optimize repeated property access.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code defines a decorator function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to cache properties but contains a flaw: it uses 'fun' as a key in '_cache' without calling 'fun' or using a consistent key, which may cause unexpected behavior but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious network or system operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'cached_property' intended to cache property results for class instances. It uses functools.wraps for function metadata preservation. The 'get' method tries to return cached data from 'self._cache[fun]', but since 'fun' (the function object) is used as a key, it might cause cache misses or unexpected behavior, though this is not malicious. No external input, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward and safe, with a minor logic flaw rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a cached property decorator with no signs of malicious behavior. It contains a logic issue related to cache key usage, but this does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign.",
