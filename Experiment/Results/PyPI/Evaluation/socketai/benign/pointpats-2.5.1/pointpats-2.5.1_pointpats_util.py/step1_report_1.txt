{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator 'cached_property' for memoizing class property methods to improve performance by caching their results.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'cached_property' and the property getter 'get' that reads from 'self._cache'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not write or transmit untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input is the property function 'fun', which is called once per instance and its result stored in 'self._cache'. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to cache property results but contains a bug: it compares 'fun' (a function object) as a key, which is unconventional. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a memoization decorator for class properties, enabling caching of computed property values. It attempts to store the result in 'self._cache' dictionary, keyed by 'fun'. However, the use of 'fun' directly as a dictionary key is unusual but not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent. The potential bug (using the function object as a key) is a typical implementation detail and does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a cached property decorator with no malicious intent. It contains a minor implementation concern but no security risks or malware are evident.",
