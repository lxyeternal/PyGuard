{
  "purpose": "Implement a cached property decorator for class attributes to improve performance by memoization.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'cached_property' which accesses 'self._cache' and calls the decorated function 'fun'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'self._cache' dictionary could be used to store untrusted data if manipulated externally, but there are no explicit sinks for untrusted data in the code.",
  "flows": "The decorator checks for existing cache in 'self._cache', initializes it if absent, then stores and returns the result of 'fun(self)'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward memoization pattern with proper use of functools.wraps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a memoization decorator for class properties, storing results in 'self._cache'. The try-except structure initializes the cache and handles cache hits. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious behavior detected. The implementation is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a cached property decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
