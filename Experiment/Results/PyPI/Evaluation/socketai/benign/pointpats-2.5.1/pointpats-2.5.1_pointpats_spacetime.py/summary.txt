  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source geospatial analysis toolkit with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs in-memory statistical tests and visualization without external communication or system modification. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 due to the deprecation warning, which is benign."
