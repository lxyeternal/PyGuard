  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and typical security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides space-time interaction analysis tools, reads shapefiles/DBF files, performs statistical tests, and visualizes results. It notes no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. The deprecation warning in 'knox' is not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code uses standard open-source libraries (geopandas, libpysal, numpy, scipy). No network, file, or system modification behaviors are present. The warning about deprecation is benign. The code is read-only concerning system resources, focusing on data analysis.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a deprecation warning)\n- **Conclusion:** Fully legitimate, standard scientific analysis code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data handling, in-memory computations, and no malicious behavior. The code performs statistical tests and visualizations using common libraries.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Uses standard practices.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate analysis toolkit.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on reading shapefiles, extracting coordinates, permutation tests, and internal data manipulations. Notes that permutation functions operate on internal data without external influence. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code behaviors. Permutation functions are standard for statistical inference. No network or file exfiltration observed.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard statistical code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting data reads, transformations, and statistical tests. No network, external communication, or dynamic code execution. Uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The deprecation warning is normal.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard geospatial analysis code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as classes/functions for space-time analysis, reading shapefiles, extracting data, performing permutations, and visualization. No network or file exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** All operations are standard for geospatial statistical analysis. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure analysis toolkit.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code does not contain any malicious activity, such as network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate **0**. The code is clear, using standard libraries without obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, open-source geospatial analysis toolkit for space-time interaction tests.\n- It reads data, performs statistical computations, and visualizes results without any suspicious or malicious operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The deprecation warning in 'knox' is a standard warning, not malicious.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and suitable for use in open-source or research environments.",
