{
  "purpose": "Provides methods and classes for analyzing space-time interaction in geospatial event data, including reading shapefiles, performing statistical tests (Knox, Mantel, Jacquez), and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads shapefiles and associated DBF files for spatial and temporal data; extracts coordinates and timestamps from dataframes; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "sinks": "Operates entirely in-memory; no network communication, file exfiltration, or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Reads data -> processes coordinates and timestamps -> performs statistical permutation tests -> visualizes results; no external data flows or malicious operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; uses standard open-source libraries; includes a deprecation warning for 'knox' but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard geospatial analysis toolkit implementing well-known statistical tests for space-time interaction. It reads data from shapefiles or dataframes, performs permutation-based significance testing, and visualizes hotspots. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The functions and classes follow typical patterns for scientific computing and statistical inference. The deprecation warning is a normal maintenance message, not an indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source geospatial analysis toolkit with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs in-memory statistical tests and visualization without external communication or system modification. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 due to the deprecation warning, which is benign.",
