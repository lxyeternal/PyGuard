{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods and classes for analyzing space-time interaction in geospatial event data, including various statistical tests and visualization tools.",
  "sources": "Data is read from shapefiles and GeoDataFrames; coordinates and timestamps are extracted from input data structures; data is manipulated and permutation tests are performed within functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as system commands, file writes, network operations, or eval/exec calls are present; data is primarily processed in-memory with numpy, pandas, geopandas, and scipy functions.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from files into geospatial dataframes; spatial and temporal coordinates are extracted; statistical functions perform computations and permutations in memory; results are stored in class attributes and returned as dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation, is evident. The code uses standard open-source libraries for geospatial and statistical analysis. No network calls, system modifications, or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical open-source implementation of space-time statistical tests with comprehensive in-memory data handling, permutation testing, and visualization functionalities. It relies on common libraries like numpy, pandas, geopandas, scipy, and libpysal, with no signs of malicious behavior. The functions perform data processing, statistical computation, and plotting without any unusual or hidden operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, no eval/exec, and no external network or system commands. All code appears to serve legitimate analytical purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of space-time interaction analysis tools, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for data analysis and visualization within geospatial contexts and does not include any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
