{
  "purpose": "The code comprises a comprehensive set of unit tests, decorators, coroutine utilities, and documentation tests intended for internal validation and utility functions within a Python project. It does not process external untrusted input nor perform network or system modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from function calls, test assertions, and internal generator/yield statements; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code's flow remains within internal function calls and test assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function definitions and calls within the test cases, through decorators and utility functions, but do not involve untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code segments detected. The code is straightforward and structured for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing suite for decorators, coroutines, dispatch mechanisms, and documentation validation. It employs common Python testing patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain sabotage. The presence of benign print statements and internal function calls further supports its benign nature. No external inputs or network activities are present, and the code's control flow is contained within the process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its content, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.2) justified by benign print statements typical in test environments.",
