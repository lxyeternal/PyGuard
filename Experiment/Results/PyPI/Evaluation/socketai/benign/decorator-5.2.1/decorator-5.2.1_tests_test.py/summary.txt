  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its content, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.2) justified by benign print statements typical in test environments."
