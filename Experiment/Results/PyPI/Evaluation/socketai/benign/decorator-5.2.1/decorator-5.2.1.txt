      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for function manipulation, decorators, and dispatching. It employs dynamic code generation in a controlled manner, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with a low security risk due to the use of compile/exec, which is standard in such metaprogramming utilities but should be used cautiously if inputs are untrusted."

      "conclusion": "This code constitutes a legitimate, sophisticated decorator utility library. It employs dynamic code generation techniques for signature preservation, which are controlled and typical for such frameworks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. The minor security concern is the use of 'exec', but in this context, it is safe and controlled. The overall security risk is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its content, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.2) justified by benign print statements typical in test environments."
