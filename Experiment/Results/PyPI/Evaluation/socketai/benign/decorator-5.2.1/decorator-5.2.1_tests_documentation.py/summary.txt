  "conclusion": "This code constitutes a legitimate, sophisticated decorator utility library. It employs dynamic code generation techniques for signature preservation, which are controlled and typical for such frameworks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. The minor security concern is the use of 'exec', but in this context, it is safe and controlled. The overall security risk is very low."
