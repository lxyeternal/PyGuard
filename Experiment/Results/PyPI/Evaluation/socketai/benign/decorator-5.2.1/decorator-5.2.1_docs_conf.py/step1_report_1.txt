  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'decorator' project.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from the 'decorator' package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into system or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious logic. The only dynamic element is importing __version__ from 'decorator', which appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical configuration file generated by sphinx-quickstart, containing setup parameters for documentation generation. It imports __version__ from the 'decorator' package, which is a standard practice for versioning. No network operations, code execution, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code strictly manages documentation build settings with no external data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports the package version and sets documentation parameters. The import of __version__ from 'decorator' is typical and safe. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
