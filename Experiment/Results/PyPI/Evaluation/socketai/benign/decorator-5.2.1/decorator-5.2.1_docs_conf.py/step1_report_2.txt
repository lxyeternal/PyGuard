  "sources": "Importing __version__ from the 'decorator' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the imported __version__ is used for version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is purely configuration with no runtime code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads project metadata and configures documentation build settings. It imports the version from the 'decorator' package, which is standard. No input validation, user input, or network operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward Sphinx configuration file, with no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file that imports the package version. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
