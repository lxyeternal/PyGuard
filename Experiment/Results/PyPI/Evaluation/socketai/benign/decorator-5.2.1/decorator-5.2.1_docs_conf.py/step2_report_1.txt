  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. The only dynamic element is importing `__version__` from the 'decorator' package, which is typical for versioning purposes. There are no network calls, data leaks, or code execution based on untrusted input.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n   No errors or flaws are identified across the reports. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration file with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which makes sense given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports concur on zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, and the code is a benign configuration script, there's no justification for elevating the risk score.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely configuration, with no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no issues warrant a higher risk or malware score.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The import of `__version__` from 'decorator' is a common pattern for version management and is safe here.  \n- No suspicious behavior, data flows, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and there is no security concern.",
