{
  "purpose": "The code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, setting parameters for building project documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports '__version__' from 'decorator' module, reads configuration variables, and sets documentation options.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or external data output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; code primarily assigns static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration with imported version info and various setup parameters. It contains no user input handling, network operations, or system modifications. The only dynamic component is the import of '__version__' from 'decorator', which is a common practice for version management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage in the configuration code. The code is structured as expected for its purpose and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical documentation build configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any harmful actions.",
