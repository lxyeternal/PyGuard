  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, setting up project metadata, extensions, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from 'decorator' package, static configuration variables, no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network calls, no file manipulations, no code execution based on external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for a documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It imports __version__ from 'decorator', which is a common pattern for versioning. There are no network activities, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The configuration variables are static and serve documentation purposes only. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The import of __version__ is safe assuming the package is trustworthy. All signals indicate benign, intended use. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import of __version__ from 'decorator' is safe and typical. The assigned scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
