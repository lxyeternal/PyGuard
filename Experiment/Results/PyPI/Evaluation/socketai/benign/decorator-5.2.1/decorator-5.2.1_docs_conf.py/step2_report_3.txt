  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only dynamic element is importing `__version__` from the 'decorator' package.\n- No network activity, data leaks, user input handling, or malicious code is detected.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, with confidence at 1.\n\n**Confirming if issues are present:**\n- The code appears benign; no issues are evident.\n- The import of `__version__` is standard practice and safe.\n- No code execution, data flow, or external interactions that could be malicious.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are apparent.\n- They correctly identify the script as a configuration file with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- Malware score: all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk: all zero, justified.\n- Obfuscated: zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- Confidence: 1, reflecting high certainty based on the static analysis.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The only assumption is that importing `__version__` from 'decorator' is safe. Given that 'decorator' is a known package, this is reasonable.\n- No hidden or malicious code is present in the provided snippet.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies noted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe configuration script.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are present.\n- The import of `__version__` is safe and typical.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a benign, standard configuration file with no security concerns.",
