  "purpose": "Configuration management for Bugsnag SDK, handling environment variables, system info, and internal state.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (API key, release stage), system info (hostname, platform), thread-local storage for request context.",
  "sinks": "Internal attributes, logger, network delivery mechanisms (not directly in this code), no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Configuration values set from environment variables or parameters; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no malicious logic, use of environment variables for secrets is standard but should be externally managed securely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for an SDK, with environment variable reads, validation decorators, and internal state management. No network operations, code injection, or dynamic execution are present. Use of environment variables for secrets is common but warrants external security practices. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK configuration code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting typical handling of secrets via environment variables, which is common practice but should be managed securely outside the code.",
