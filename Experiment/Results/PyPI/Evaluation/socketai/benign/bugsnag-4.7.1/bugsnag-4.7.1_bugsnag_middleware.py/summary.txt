  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured middleware system for error reporting with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk is minimal and justified by the potential for middleware to modify or suppress notifications, which is a common feature. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scores."
