  "purpose": "Middleware for capturing request data and reporting unhandled exceptions to Bugsnag in an ASGI application.",
  "sources": "Request headers, URL components, client IP, environment variables, and scope data.",
  "sinks": "Bugsnag's notify functions, external network transmission of request info and environment data.",
  "flows": "Request data is collected from scope, processed, and sent to Bugsnag; exceptions trigger auto_notify.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard request parsing, error reporting, and environment data collection. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The data flow is typical for error monitoring middleware, transmitting request info to an external service. The request handling and exception capture are straightforward and secure. No evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Bugsnag middleware for ASGI apps. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
