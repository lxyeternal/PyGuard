{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated Notification class that extends bugsnag.event.Event and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import 'warnings' and the class constructor parameters 'exception', 'config', 'request_config', and 'options'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks, execution, or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code issues a deprecation warning upon instantiation and then calls the parent constructor with provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a deprecation warning indicates awareness of future removal, but no malicious or unusual code behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and a specific class Event from bugsnag.event. It defines a Notification class that subclasses Event. The constructor issues a DeprecationWarning to inform users that Notification is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It then calls the superclass constructor with the same arguments. There are no data leaks, malicious code, or insecure operations present. The code structure is straightforward and primarily serves as a backward compatibility wrapper with a warning message.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious deprecation wrapper for an existing class. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to inform users about deprecation while maintaining backward compatibility.",
