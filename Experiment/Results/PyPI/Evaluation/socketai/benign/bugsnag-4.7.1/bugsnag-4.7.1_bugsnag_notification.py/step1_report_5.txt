{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated Notification class that extends bugsnag.event.Event for handling exception notifications.",
  "sources": "Import of warnings module, import of Event from bugsnag.event, usage of class constructor with parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data transmission observed",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Notification triggers a warning and then calls the parent constructor",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated class with a deprecation warning; no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass Notification of bugsnag.event.Event, issuing a DeprecationWarning upon instantiation. The warning is informational, indicating deprecation. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behavior are detected. No suspicious control flow or obfuscation is present. The code relies on external bugsnag library without modifying or exploiting it.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign deprecation wrapper for an existing class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
