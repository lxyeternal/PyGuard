{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated Notification class that inherits from bugsnag.event.Event and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules and the parameters passed to the constructor (__init__ method).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as database writes, network calls, or file operations that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves instantiating Notification, issuing a warning, then calling the superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "The class is deprecated; no malicious or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and Event from bugsnag.event, then defines a Notification class that inherits from Event. Upon instantiation, it issues a deprecation warning indicating the class will be removed in the future. The constructor passes all parameters to the superclass constructor. No input validation, external data processing, or sensitive operations are performed. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, deprecated subclass with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a wrapper that issues a deprecation warning and delegates initialization to the superclass. There are no security risks or malware indications.",
