{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated Notification class that inherits from bugsnag.event.Event and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: exception, config, request_config, and options passed to the Notification constructor.",
  "sinks": "super().__init__() call passing data to the Event class constructor.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives data -> issues warning -> calls parent constructor with data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated class and warns about it; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Notification class that extends bugsnag.event.Event, issuing a DeprecationWarning when instantiated. The class is solely for backward compatibility and does not perform any data manipulation, external network calls, or other risky behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious flows are present. The warning indicates awareness of deprecation but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deprecation wrapper around an existing class with no malicious intent or security issues. It is benign and only issues a warning upon use.",
