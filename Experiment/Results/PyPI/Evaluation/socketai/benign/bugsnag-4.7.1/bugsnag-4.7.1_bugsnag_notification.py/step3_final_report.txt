{
  "purpose": "A deprecated subclass 'Notification' inheriting from 'bugsnag.event.Event' that issues a deprecation warning and delegates to the superclass constructor.",
  "sources": "Imports 'warnings' module and 'Event' class; reads parameters in constructor",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Constructor receives parameters, issues warning, then calls superclass constructor with same parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward deprecation wrapper; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple subclass used for backward compatibility, issuing a deprecation warning upon instantiation. It only delegates to the parent class constructor, with no external data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code is clear, readable, and standard in practice. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The deprecation warning is a common method for signaling future removal. The code does not process untrusted input or perform unsafe operations. All signals indicate benign intent with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward deprecation wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.",
