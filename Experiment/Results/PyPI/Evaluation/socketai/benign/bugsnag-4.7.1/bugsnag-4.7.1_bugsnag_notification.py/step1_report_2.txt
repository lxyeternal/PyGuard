  "purpose": "Define a deprecated Notification class that extends the Event class for handling error events, issuing a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: exception, config, request_config, and **options.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the super().__init__ call; no other data flows or manipulations observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn to notify deprecation; no suspicious or unusual code structures. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and Event class, defines a Notification class that extends Event. The constructor issues a deprecation warning and then calls the superclass constructor with the provided arguments. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not process or leak untrusted data, nor does it perform any unsafe operations or include obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless deprecation wrapper around an Event class. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
