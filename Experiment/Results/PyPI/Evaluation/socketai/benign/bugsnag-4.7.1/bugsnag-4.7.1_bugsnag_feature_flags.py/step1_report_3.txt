{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing feature flags, including creation, validation, storage, and serialization of feature flags.",
  "sources": "User input can be provided through method parameters such as 'name' and 'variant' in add() and merge() functions, and data from external sources could influence flag creation and storage.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted to dictionaries via to_dict(), and output as JSON via to_json(). No external data sinks such as network or file I/O are directly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (name, variant) through FeatureFlag creation -> validation -> storage in FeatureFlagDelegate -> serialization for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward validation and storage without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for managing feature flags with validation and serialization. It uses common data structures (OrderedDict) and simple validation checks. No dynamic code execution, external network connections, or suspicious behavior are evident. The methods focus on in-memory data handling with no external side effects or hidden functionalities. The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a feature flag management utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward data handling, validation, and serialization, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
