  "purpose": "Manage feature flags including creation, validation, storage, merging, removal, copying, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for FeatureFlag (name, variant); method calls for add, merge, remove, clear, copy, to_json.",
  "sinks": "Serialization via to_dict() and to_json() methods; storage in in-memory OrderedDict.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into FeatureFlag instances, which are validated and stored; to_json serializes stored flags for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; standard data handling; safe variant coercion; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward feature flag management system with validation and serialization. No external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The variant coercion is safe, and data validation ensures integrity. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The minimal security risk stems from accepting external input, but within this context, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured feature flag utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by minimal input handling concerns. No modifications are necessary.",
