  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing feature flags with validation, storage, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for class constructors and method calls (name, variant, flags list).",
  "sinks": "Serialization in to_json() method which converts feature flags to JSON-compatible dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Inputs (names, variants, flags list) -> FeatureFlag instances -> storage in FeatureFlagDelegate -> output as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No use of external network, system modification, or hidden code. The only potential concern is the coercion of variant to string, which is safe and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of feature flag management, with validation, storage, and serialization. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The '_coerce_variant' method safely converts non-string variants to strings, avoiding code injection risks. The serialization method outputs only feature flag data. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, and the code appears well-structured and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It functions as a feature flag management utility without any security risks identified.",
