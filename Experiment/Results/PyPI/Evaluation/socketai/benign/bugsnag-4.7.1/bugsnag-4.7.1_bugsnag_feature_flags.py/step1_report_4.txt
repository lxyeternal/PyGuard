{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing feature flags, including creation, validation, storage, and serialization to JSON.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function parameters such as 'name', 'variant', and lists of FeatureFlag objects.",
  "sinks": "The 'to_json' method serializes feature flags to dictionaries, which could be used for output. No direct sinks for untrusted data processing or external communication are evident.",
  "flows": "FeatureFlag objects are created from input parameters, validated, stored in an OrderedDict, and later serialized into JSON-compatible dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard data handling without obscure language features, code injection, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The classes manage feature flags with validation, storage, and serialization. Input data is only used to create feature flags, which are validated and stored internally. The 'to_json' method outputs data in a JSON-compatible format, with no external network or file operations. No malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations are evident. The code appears to be straightforward and secure, assuming inputs are provided from trusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for feature flag management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles data internally and provides serialization functionalities. No malware or security concerns are identified.",
