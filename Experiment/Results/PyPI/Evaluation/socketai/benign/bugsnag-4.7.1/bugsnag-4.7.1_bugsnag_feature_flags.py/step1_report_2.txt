{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing feature flags, allowing creation, validation, storage, merging, and serialization of feature flags with names and optional variants.",
  "sources": "Data is read from method parameters such as name, variant, and input lists of FeatureFlag objects.",
  "sinks": "Data is output via to_dict(), to_list(), to_json(), and stored in the _storage OrderedDict. No data flows directly to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, variant, list of FeatureFlags) are validated and stored; validated data is serialized into dictionaries or lists for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. No unusual code behaviors are evident. The code uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement feature flag management with proper validation, comparison, and serialization. The code operates solely on in-memory data structures, with no network access or external calls. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling identified. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The logic appears to be straightforward and purpose-driven for feature flag management. No anomalies indicating malicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of feature flag handling without malicious intent or security risks. It manages data internally with validation and serialization but does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data beyond the feature flag attributes.",
