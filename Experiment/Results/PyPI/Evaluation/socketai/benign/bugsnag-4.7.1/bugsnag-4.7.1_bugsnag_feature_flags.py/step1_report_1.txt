{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing feature flags, allowing creation, validation, storage, merging, removal, copying, and JSON serialization of feature flags.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as 'name', 'variant', and external lists of FeatureFlag objects. No direct untrusted data input sources like network or file reading are present.",
  "sinks": "The data is serialized to JSON-compatible dictionaries in 'to_json()' and 'to_dict()'. The main output sink is JSON serialization; no network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs to object properties, then to internal storage (_storage). Valid feature flags are stored and later converted to dictionaries for JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed. The code performs standard data validation and object management tasks. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement feature flag management with validation and serialization functions. The code does not interact with external systems beyond standard data handling. All data validation appears proper, and no insecure operations are detected. The overall design seems straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It appears intended for feature flag management in applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign feature flag management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard data handling, validation, and serialization without external interactions or suspicious code patterns.",
