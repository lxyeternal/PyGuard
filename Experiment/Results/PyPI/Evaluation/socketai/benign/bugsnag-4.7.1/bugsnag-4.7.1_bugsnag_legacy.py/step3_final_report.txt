  "purpose": "SDK wrapper for Bugsnag error reporting, session management, breadcrumbs, feature flags, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, exception objects, sys.exc_info(), user input, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Bugsnag client methods, logging, external network communication via SDK functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into Bugsnag client methods for error reporting, breadcrumbs, feature flags, and sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, minor default argument concern (mutable default args).",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface for error tracking and configuration. It uses standard patterns, handles exceptions, and provides hooks for callbacks. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Callback functions are intended for user customization, not malicious purposes. The use of mutable default arguments is a minor Python anti-pattern but not malicious. The overall structure and data flow are consistent with benign SDK behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign SDK wrapper for Bugsnag with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. It handles error reporting, breadcrumbs, feature flags, and configuration safely. The high risk scores in some reports are overestimations; a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given the code's purpose. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0.",
