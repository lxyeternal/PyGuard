{
  "purpose": "Enhance debugging by dropping into the PyCharm debugger upon uncaught exceptions during pytest execution.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'pydevd' and 'pydevd_tracing' modules; access to 'call.excinfo._excinfo' for exception details; use of 'threading.current_thread()'.",
  "sinks": "Debugger functions such as 'pydevd.debugger.stop_on_unhandled_exception' and 'handle_post_mortem_stop' which execute debugging actions based on exception data.",
  "flows": "Exception information from 'call.excinfo._excinfo' flows through to debugger functions via 'stop_on_unhandled_exception' or 'handle_post_mortem_stop', triggered upon uncaught exceptions in pytest.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively interfaces with an external debugger to modify execution flow during exceptions. It relies on optional imports and handles missing modules gracefully. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to facilitate debugging by hooking into pytest's exception handling and invoking the PyCharm debugger if available. It imports debugger modules conditionally, extracts exception info, constructs traceback frames, and calls debugger methods to halt execution for inspection. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activity is present. The use of standard debugging practices and exception handling indicates legitimate development tooling use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging aid intended for development environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply interfaces with known debugging modules to assist developers during test failures.",
