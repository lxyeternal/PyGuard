{
  "purpose": "To integrate with pytest for debugging by dropping into PyCharm debugger upon uncaught exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports pydevd and pydevd_tracing modules; reads exception info from call.excinfo; accesses threading.current_thread(); retrieves traceback frames.",
  "sinks": "Calls pydevd.debugger.stop_on_unhandled_exception and debugger.handle_post_mortem_stop, which could potentially execute debugging code or manipulate debugging state.",
  "flows": "On uncaught exceptions, exception info flows from call.excinfo to debugger functions; thread and traceback frames are passed to debugger methods.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal debugging modules (pydevd, pydevd_tracing) and manipulates traceback frames; conditional fallback for different API versions; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with the debugger API to facilitate debugging in case of exceptions. It imports debugging modules only if available, retrieves exception info and traceback frames, and invokes debugger methods. No hardcoded credentials, malicious system commands, or suspicious data flows are present. The code is straightforward and aligned with debugging purposes. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications outside debugging context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging aid designed to hook into exceptions and initiate debugging sessions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is solely related to development debugging without any malicious intent.",
