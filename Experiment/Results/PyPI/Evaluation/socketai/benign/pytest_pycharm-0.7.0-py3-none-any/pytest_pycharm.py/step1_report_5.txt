{
  "purpose": "To facilitate debugging by dropping into the PyCharm debugger upon uncaught exceptions during pytest runs.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pydevd' module for debugging and accesses exception information from the call object.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems, files, or network; it mainly interacts with debugging tools and internal exception data.",
  "flows": "Exception information flows from 'call.excinfo._excinfo' to debugger functions; exception details are passed to debugger.stop_on_unhandled_exception or handle_post_mortem_stop.",
  "anomalies": "Code conditionally imports 'pydevd' and interacts with debugger internals; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for debugging purposes, specifically integrating pytest with PyCharm's debugger. It conditionally imports debugging modules, extracts exception info, and invokes debugger methods to handle exceptions. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or unauthorized system interactions. The logic is standard for debugging workflows and adheres to expected behavior for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging utility that enables easier exception handling during pytest runs within PyCharm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for development/debugging purposes.",
