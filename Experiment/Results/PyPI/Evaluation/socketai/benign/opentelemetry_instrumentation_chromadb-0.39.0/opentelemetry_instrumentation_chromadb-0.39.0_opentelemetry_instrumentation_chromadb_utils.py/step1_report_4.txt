{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to catch and log exceptions in functions, with optional custom exception handling via Config.",
  "sources": "The code reads function calls, exception information, and configuration data from 'Config'.",
  "sinks": "The code logs exception tracebacks and may invoke a user-defined exception logger from 'Config'.",
  "flows": "Function execution calls wrapped by 'dont_throw', exceptions are caught, logged, and optionally passed to 'Config.exception_logger'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception handling and logging practices are used. No suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'dont_throw' that wraps a function to catch all exceptions, logs detailed traceback information, and optionally calls a custom exception logger if provided in the configuration. Uses standard logging practices and external configuration. No external data inputs or untrusted data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward exception handling decorator with logging, intended for robust error management. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
