  "purpose": "A decorator that wraps functions to catch exceptions, log traceback details at DEBUG level, and optionally invoke a configurable exception logger.",
  "sources": "Function calls, access to Config.exception_logger",
  "sinks": "Logging traceback, calling Config.exception_logger with exception object",
  "flows": "Wrapped function executes -> exception raised -> logs traceback -> invokes Config.exception_logger if set",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward exception handling pattern",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard exception handling decorator that logs exceptions and calls an external logger if configured. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The reliance on Config.exception_logger could be misused externally, but this is outside the code's scope. The implementation is correct, and the external dependency is optional. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for exception handling and logging. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The only potential concern is external configuration misuse, but the code itself is safe.",
