{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to wrap functions, catch exceptions, log errors, and optionally handle exceptions via a configured logger.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the function it decorates, accesses the logger via logging.getLogger, and reads Config.exception_logger.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the exception handling function Config.exception_logger could process untrusted data if misused, but no explicit sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Exceptions from the wrapped function are caught, logged, and passed to Config.exception_logger if it exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The decorator logs exceptions at the debug level, which is standard. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard exception-catching decorator that logs exceptions and optionally calls a logger from the Config class. It imports standard modules and a configuration class. The decorator wraps functions, capturing exceptions and logging traceback information. It calls a configurable exception handler if present. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of external configuration for exception handling is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for exception handling and logging with no malicious intent or security issues. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or malware indications.",
