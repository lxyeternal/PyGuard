  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python version declaration assigning a string to __version__. It contains no input/output operations, no external data handling, no code execution, and no obfuscation. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1). There are no inconsistencies or errors in the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, consistent, and correctly scored. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
