  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no network or file operations, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.  \n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the minimal, standard pattern of version assignment in Python, with no suspicious constructs or anomalies. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\nThese scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports conclude no malicious activity, no security risk, and no obfuscation, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a typical version assignment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis: benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
