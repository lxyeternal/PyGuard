  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no external inputs, no data flows, no sinks, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is minimal, typical for Python package version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this code snippet is benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The conclusions that the code is safe and non-malicious are justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is a simple version string assignment, posing no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious behavior or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as metadata.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without basis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code snippet is a standard, minimal version declaration in Python. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security issues. The scores are correct, and no changes are necessary.",
