  "purpose": "Assigns the version string '0.39.0' to the variable __version__.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string '__version__' assigned to a string value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a version string assignment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version variable with a static string. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple version assignment statement.",
