  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with a single class variable for an exception logger.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points that process untrusted data or could leak information.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving sources and sinks; the code only declares a class variable.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains a variable 'exception_logger' initialized to None, which could potentially be assigned a logger object elsewhere, but on its own, this is not unusual or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class 'Config' with a single class attribute 'exception_logger' initialized to None. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The pattern is typical for configuration management. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard configuration placeholder for an exception logger. There are no malicious activities, backdoors, or security risks identified in this fragment.",
