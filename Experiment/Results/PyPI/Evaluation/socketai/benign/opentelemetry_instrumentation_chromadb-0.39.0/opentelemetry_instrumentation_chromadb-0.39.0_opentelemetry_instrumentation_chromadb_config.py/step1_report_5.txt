  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with a single class attribute for an exception logger.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a class with an attribute initialized to None, which is not inherently suspicious but could indicate a placeholder for future logger implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class named Config with a class attribute 'exception_logger' set to None. There are no functions, no data input, and no external operations. The code appears to serve as a configuration holder, possibly to be assigned a logger object later. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no signs of malware. It is a minimal and straightforward class definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration class without any malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for an exception logger but does not perform any harmful actions or contain malware.",
