{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with a class variable for an exception logger.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that could leak data or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains a variable intended for logging but is initialized as None; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with a single class variable set to None. It lacks any executable statements, input/output operations, or suspicious constructs. No security issues, malware behavior, or obfuscated code are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger system where exception_logger might be assigned later.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal configuration class setup.",
