  "purpose": "A minimal configuration class with a class variable 'exception_logger' initialized to None, likely serving as a placeholder for future assignment.",
  "sources": "Class definition reading the class variable 'exception_logger'. No input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the class variable is set to None and not used within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a class variable set to None, serving as a placeholder. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class with a single class variable initialized to None. It contains no functions, input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The code appears to be a configuration placeholder, possibly to be assigned a logger object elsewhere. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
