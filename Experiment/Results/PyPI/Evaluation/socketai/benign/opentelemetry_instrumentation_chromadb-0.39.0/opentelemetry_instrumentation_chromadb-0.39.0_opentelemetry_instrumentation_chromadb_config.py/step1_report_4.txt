  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with a single class attribute for exception logging.",
  "sources": "None present; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None present; there are no data outputs or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares a class attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the class attribute is initialized to None, which is not unusual. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class named Config with a single class variable exception_logger set to None. There are no input sources, data processing, or output mechanisms. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No external dependencies or behaviors are indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple configuration holder. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
