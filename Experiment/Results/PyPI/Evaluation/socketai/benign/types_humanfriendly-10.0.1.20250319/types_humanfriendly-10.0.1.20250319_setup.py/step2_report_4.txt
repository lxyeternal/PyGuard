  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, no dynamic or untrusted data, no suspicious code, and URLs pointing to known repositories.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a static, well-formed setup script with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no external data handling or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with static data, no dynamic or untrusted input, URLs are official, no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code content; no security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static metadata, no external input, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with static data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely static configuration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, benign nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for a type stub package.\n- No dynamic code, no external data processing, no suspicious URLs or behaviors.\n- All URLs point to official repositories or documentation.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code patterns.\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores across all reports are accurate and justified based on the code content. No further action or adjustment needed.",
