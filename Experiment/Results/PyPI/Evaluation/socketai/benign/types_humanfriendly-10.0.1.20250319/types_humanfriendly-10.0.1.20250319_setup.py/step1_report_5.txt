  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the 'types-humanfriendly' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Data includes package metadata such as name, description, long_description, URLs, dependencies, package data, license, Python version requirements, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data is static or hardcoded within the script.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic or untrusted data flows; the setup process uses static data for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The script is standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script importing 'setuptools' and configuring package metadata. All values are static, and there are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, or environment variable usage. The URLs and data points are publicly accessible and appear legitimate. The package data references standard stub files and license information. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
