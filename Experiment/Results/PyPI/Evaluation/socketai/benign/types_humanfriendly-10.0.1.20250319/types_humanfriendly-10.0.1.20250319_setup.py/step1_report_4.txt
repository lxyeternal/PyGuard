  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'types-humanfriendly' Python package, primarily for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, configuration parameters, and dependencies; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not perform any operations that involve untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of setuptools setup with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to configure a package. It contains static metadata including package name, description, long description, URLs, package data, and classifiers. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. The script does not include any suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious code. All dependencies are explicitly specified as empty, indicating no external dependencies are dynamically loaded or manipulated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and distribution.",
