{
  "purpose": "Provides network utility functions for ICMP packet forging, hostname resolution, IP validation, and random data generation.",
  "sources": "Hostname input in resolve() and async_resolve(), system calls like getaddrinfo, getpid(), and random choices for byte sequence.",
  "sinks": "DNS resolution functions, random byte sequence generation, and ID incrementation; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Hostname or FQDN input flows into DNS resolution functions; random data functions generate data for potential use; ID functions modify internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard network utility functions with proper exception handling and no malicious or obfuscated components. The DNS resolution includes fallback logic, and random byte generation uses choices() from a safe character set. No suspicious data flows or external communications are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured network utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
