  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a standard, benign module initialization for an ICMP network utility library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the potential for misuse if functions are invoked improperly, but no active threats are present in this code. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy."
