{
  "purpose": "Provides functionalities for forging ICMP packets, ping, traceroute, and related network utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local package files (.sockets, .models, .ping, etc.) and utility functions (is_hostname, is_ipv4_address, is_ipv6_address, PID, resolve, async_resolve).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data output or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports potentially receive data from network interfaces or user inputs processed by utility functions; however, the main code is primarily import statements and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious pattern detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and metadata (author, license, version info). There is no executable logic, data processing, or network operations within this snippet. The package appears to be a standard network utility library with open-source licensing and no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is a typical open-source network utility package with no suspicious activity or security issues detected.",
