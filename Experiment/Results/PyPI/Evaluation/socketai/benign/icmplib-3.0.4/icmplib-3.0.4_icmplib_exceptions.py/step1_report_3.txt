{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and error handling for an ICMP packet forging library, facilitating network diagnostics such as ping and traceroute.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it mainly defines exception classes and static data structures for error messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no input/output or network interactions are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code solely establishes exception classes and static error code mappings without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard class definitions and static mappings for exceptions related to ICMP errors. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a set of custom exception classes and static error code mappings for an ICMP networking library. It does not perform data input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The classes are well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The error messages and class structures are typical for error handling in network libraries, with no indications of embedded malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving as part of a network diagnostics library for handling ICMP errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for its purpose.",
