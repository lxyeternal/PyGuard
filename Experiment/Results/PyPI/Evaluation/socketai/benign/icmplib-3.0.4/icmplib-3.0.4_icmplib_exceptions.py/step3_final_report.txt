{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and static mappings for ICMP error codes used in ICMP packet handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input; static class attributes and constructor parameters used for error messages.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely exception message generation.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond exception instantiation; no network or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for error handling and static mappings for ICMP error codes. It does not perform network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard and well-formed, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The exception classes are straightforward, and the static dictionaries serve as message mappings. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard component of an ICMP library, providing error handling classes and static error code mappings. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk associated with this code segment.",
