{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling ICMP-related errors in the icmplib package.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains class definitions and constants only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified, as the code only defines exceptions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to ICMP operations, including detailed error messages and error code mappings. No input handling, network operations, or data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system interactions. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for an ICMP library, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for handling ICMP errors. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module. It appears to be a benign, standard part of the icmplib package.",
