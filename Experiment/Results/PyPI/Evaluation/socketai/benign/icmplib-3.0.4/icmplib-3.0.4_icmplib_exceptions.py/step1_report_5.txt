{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling ICMP-related errors in the icmplib package.",
  "sources": "The code primarily defines classes and constants; no external data inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not handle external inputs or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up exception classes and error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. Exception classes and error messages are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception handling for ICMP-related errors, defining multiple specific exception classes with static messages and code mappings. It does not include any network operations, external data processing, or code injection points. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are present. The overall structure and content are consistent with a standard error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of exception classes for an ICMP library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a network utility package.",
