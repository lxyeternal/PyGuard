{
  "purpose": "This code implements a traceroute utility using ICMP packets to determine the route to a destination host.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname or IP address input; reads optional parameters such as count, interval, timeout, payload, source address, and family; reads from socket during send and receive operations.",
  "sinks": "Sends ICMP packets via socket; processes responses to determine route; no evident data leaks or insecure data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input hostname/IP → resolve (if hostname) → send ICMP requests via socket → receive ICMP responses → process replies → return list of hops.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. Usage of sockets and ICMP requests appears standard. No suspicious payload manipulation or data exfiltration mechanisms identified. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard network diagnostic functions, constructing ICMP requests, managing socket communications, and processing replies to map the network path. It uses appropriate exception handling for common network errors and includes configurable parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The code does not execute any external commands or access sensitive environment variables. All external interactions are within expected network diagnostic operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a traceroute utility. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for network probing and does not include any suspicious or malicious functionalities.",
