  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script for packaging, invoking setuptools.setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only executes a standard setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with only comments and a single call to 'setup()'. No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or network activity are involved. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with high confidence scores and no malicious or risky elements. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a benign assessment, and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
