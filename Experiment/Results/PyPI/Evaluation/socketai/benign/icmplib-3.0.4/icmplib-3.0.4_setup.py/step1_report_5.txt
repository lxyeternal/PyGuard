  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script does not perform any operations involving untrusted data or network communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the script only calls setup() without parameters or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The script is a minimal setup configuration with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. No unusual or malicious patterns are present.",
