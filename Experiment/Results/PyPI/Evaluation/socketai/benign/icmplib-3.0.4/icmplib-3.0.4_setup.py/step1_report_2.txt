  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'icmplib' Python package, intended to facilitate the creation of ICMP packets for ping and traceroute functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' library import for package setup.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports a library and calls 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the script is a standard setup configuration without hidden or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' to define package installation parameters. There are no inputs, outputs, or code execution beyond standard package setup. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The script is minimal and adheres to typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated components. It solely facilitates package installation.",
