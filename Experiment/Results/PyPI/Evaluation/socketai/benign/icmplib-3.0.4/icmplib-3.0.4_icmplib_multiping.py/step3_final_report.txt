{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous and synchronous functions to perform ICMP ping operations on multiple hosts, allowing for network diagnostics and reachability checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'addresses', 'source', and optional kwargs; external functions 'async_ping' and 'resolve' handle network operations.",
  "sinks": "External functions 'async_ping' and 'resolve' perform network I/O; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'async_ping' and 'resolve' functions; results are collected into Host objects and returned, with no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard network ping utilities with proper concurrency management. It relies on external functions presumed to be safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The parameters and flow are typical for such utilities, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond network testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate network diagnostic utility with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified by its intended purpose and standard implementation.",
