  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It’s a standard `__init__.py` style module for the `shinywidgets` package.\n- It defines package metadata (`__author__`, `__email__`, `__version__`).\n- It imports functions from internal modules.\n- It defines `__all__` to specify the public API.\n- No functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, network, or file I/O.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n**Code content:**  \n- No suspicious or malicious code present.  \n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reports correctly identify that this is a benign package initializer with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly state that the code is a standard package setup.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0 in all reports, matching the code's clarity.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the code’s benign nature.  \n- No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious patterns.  \n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- All reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis, which is correct given the code snippet.  \n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All assessments are consistent with the code content.  \n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Given the code and the reports, I concur that:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely structural, importing and exporting functions without any dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- The assessments are accurate and aligned with the code’s simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is a standard, safe package initializer with no security risks.",
