  "sources": "The code reads metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports various internal modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the provided code; the code mainly imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "The code does not include dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing; it only establishes module exports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are observed. All import statements and metadata appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an initializer or entry point for the package, defining metadata and exporting functions for external use. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present. The import statements are standard, and there are no suspicious or malicious patterns. Overall, the code's structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
