  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__), internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, network calls, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules, setting __all__ for public API.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package __init__ structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, importing functions and setting __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, well-structured package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a standard package initializer with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The assessment is consistent and justified.",
