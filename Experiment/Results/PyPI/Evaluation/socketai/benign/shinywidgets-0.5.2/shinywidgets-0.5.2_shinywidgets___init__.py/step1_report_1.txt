{
  "purpose": "This package provides top-level API functions for rendering and reactive reading in shinywidgets, a Python library for interactive widgets.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports various functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are processed; the code primarily imports functions and sets __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script only defines package metadata, imports functions, and specifies exports (__all__). There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard package __init__.py file for organizing module exports. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply imports and exposes functions for a Python widget library.",
