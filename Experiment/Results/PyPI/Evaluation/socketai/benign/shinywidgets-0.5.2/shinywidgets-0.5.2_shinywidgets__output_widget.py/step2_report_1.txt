  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code constructs a `<div>` element that includes dependencies (via `output_binding_dependency()`), scripts with CDN URLs (`SHINYWIDGETS_CDN`, `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY`), and styling based on optional width/height parameters.\n- It conditionally wraps the element with fill and fillable behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- External dependencies and CDN URLs are standard for widget rendering.\n- No user input is directly used in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration.\n- The data attributes in the `<script>` tag are typical for widget loading mechanisms.\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The dependencies and external URLs appear standard and trustworthy (assuming CDN URLs are secure).\n- The code's purpose is to generate UI components safely within a web framework.\n\n### Specific issues:\n- **No issues are present in the code** as per the reports; all are consistent with standard widget rendering patterns.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by reliance on external CDN scripts and standard practices, but always assuming CDN trustworthiness.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to dependency on external scripts, but not inherently risky)  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for rendering widget containers with dependencies and styling options. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and aligns with common widget rendering patterns.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No further action or concern is necessary from a security standpoint.",
