  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the function's role and the dependencies used.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious logic, straightforward construction, reliance on external CDN URLs is standard. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given reliance on external CDN scripts, which is common but could be risky if CDN is compromised—though this is outside the code's control.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the function's role and dependencies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious logic, standard HTML and dependency handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the function and dependencies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard widget generation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores. Slightly higher securityRisk due to external dependencies, but this is typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard UI component, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns, standard dependency inclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not contain any obfuscated or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's reliance on external CDN scripts, the risk is minimal but exists if CDN is compromised. The scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, standard dependency inclusion, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** The code's security posture heavily depends on the trustworthiness of the CDN URLs. If those are compromised, the risk increases, but based on the code alone, no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThe current reports are consistent with a benign, well-structured widget rendering function with negligible security concerns.",
