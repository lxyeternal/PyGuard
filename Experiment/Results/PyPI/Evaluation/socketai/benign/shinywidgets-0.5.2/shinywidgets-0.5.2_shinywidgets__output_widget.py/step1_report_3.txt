  "purpose": "Define a function to create a customizable output widget for a Shiny application, with optional styling and layout behavior.",
  "sources": "resolve_id() function, data attributes in tags.script, input parameters (id, width, height, fill, fillable), imported dependencies",
  "sinks": "tags.div creation, data attributes in script, potential CSS styling, returned Tag object",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> resolve_id() -> tags.div with dependencies and scripts -> optional fill/as_fill_item/as_fillable_container modifications -> return Tag",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of external dependencies appears standard. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or data leakage mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for generating a UI component with optional styling and layout options, utilizing imported functions and dependencies. It uses standard HTML tag creation, attribute setting, and conditional wrapping for fillable behaviors. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or sensitive data processing observed. The data attributes in the script tag seem to load external scripts, which is common in widget implementations. Overall, the code follows typical patterns for UI generation and dependency management without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component generator for a Shiny application, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard dependencies and performs typical UI element creation without any suspicious activity.",
