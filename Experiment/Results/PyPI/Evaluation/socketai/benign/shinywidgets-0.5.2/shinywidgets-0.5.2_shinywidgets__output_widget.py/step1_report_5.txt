  "purpose": "Generate an HTML div element with embedded dependencies and styles for rendering a widget in a shiny application.",
  "sources": "resolve_id function, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, output_binding_dependency(), user-provided id, width, height, fill, fillable parameters.",
  "sinks": "Tags.div output, script tag with CDN data attributes, style attribute with CSS units, dependent functions generating HTML components.",
  "flows": "Input id and style parameters -> resolve_id for id normalization -> inclusion of dependency scripts and styles in HTML -> conditional wrapping with fill and fillable layout components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of data attributes for CDN URLs is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTML div containing script dependencies and styling based on input parameters. It resolves the element id, includes external widget dependencies via data attributes, and adjusts layout using fill and fillable wrappers. No untrusted data handling, no network connections, or harmful operations are present. All functions and modules used appear standard for UI component generation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard UI component builder with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It properly manages dependencies and layout options without exposing security vulnerabilities.",
