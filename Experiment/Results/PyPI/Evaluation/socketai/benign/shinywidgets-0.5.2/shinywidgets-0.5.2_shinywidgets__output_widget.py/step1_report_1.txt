  "purpose": "Defines a function to create a customizable HTML div element for rendering a widget with optional size and fill properties, including dependencies and scripts.",
  "sources": "resolve_id function (shiny.module), SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, output_binding_dependency() function",
  "sinks": "tags.script for injecting script tags with CDN data attributes, tags.div for output element, CSS style application",
  "flows": "resolve_id feeds into the div's id attribute; output_binding_dependency() and head_content() inject dependencies/scripts into the head; style parameters use as_css_unit functions; fill and fillable flags modify the structure with fill items and containers",
  "anomalies": "Use of data attributes to load CDN scripts could be exploited if the CDN hosts malicious scripts, but this is a standard pattern for widget loading. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTML div element for widget output, incorporating dependencies and CDN scripts via data attributes. It allows optional sizing and fill properties, applying CSS styles accordingly. The dependencies and scripts are standard for widget rendering. No user input is directly used for script sources or other sensitive data. The code relies on external dependencies (cdn URLs and functions) but does not itself contain malicious logic. The overall structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard widget rendering function with dependencies and styling. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is detected. It appears safe for inclusion in a larger project, assuming the CDN URLs are trustworthy.",
