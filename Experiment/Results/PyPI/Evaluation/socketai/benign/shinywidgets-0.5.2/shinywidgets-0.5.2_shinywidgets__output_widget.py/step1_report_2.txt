{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to create a custom HTML widget component for a web application, likely used within a Shiny-like framework for rendering interactive widgets.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: id, width, height, fill, fillable; imported modules and constants such as SHINYWIDGETS_CDN and SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML tags including <div>, <script>, and CSS styling; potential data embedding via data attributes",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and incorporated into HTML and CSS elements; dependency data attributes are included in the script tag; styling is applied based on width/height inputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; the code constructs HTML and CSS elements straightforwardly without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function 'output_widget' that resolves an element ID, then constructs a <div> containing dependency scripts and theme/style information. It conditionally wraps the element for fill and fillable behaviors. All operations are standard for web UI component generation. No malicious logic, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity is present. The data attributes and external dependencies are typical for widget integrations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard widget rendering function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely generates HTML components for embedding widgets, with no evidence of backdoors, data theft, or malicious code.",
