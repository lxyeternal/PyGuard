{
  "purpose": "Constructs an HTML <div> element for widget output, embedding dependencies, scripts, and styling based on optional width and height parameters.",
  "sources": "resolve_id function for ID resolution; external CDN URLs embedded as data attributes in the <script> tag; dependency functions like output_binding_dependency(); input parameters for width and height.",
  "sinks": "The <script> tag with CDN URLs; data attributes used for widget loading; style attributes for CSS styling.",
  "flows": "resolve_id processes ID; dependencies and scripts are embedded within the <div>; style attributes set width and height; external scripts loaded via data attributes for widget rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward HTML and dependency inclusion; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reliance on external CDN URLs is standard but could be a vector if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a widget container with dependencies and styling, using external CDN URLs embedded as data attributes. It conditionally wraps the container with fill and fillable behaviors. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The external dependencies are typical for widget frameworks. The code is clean, readable, and follows standard practices. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of CDN URLs, but the code itself does not contain malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for rendering widget containers with dependencies and styling. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external CDN trustworthiness, which is outside the code's scope.",
