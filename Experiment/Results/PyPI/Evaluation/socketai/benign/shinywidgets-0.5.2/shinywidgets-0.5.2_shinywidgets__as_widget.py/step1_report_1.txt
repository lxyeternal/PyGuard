{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to coerce various visualization and widget objects into ipywidget.Widget instances for display in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "User-provided objects passed to functions like as_widget, as_widget_altair, as_widget_bokeh, as_widget_plotly, as_widget_pydeck.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of untrusted data in visualization objects; no direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked and sometimes transformed into widgets; data flows from input parameters through type checks and import statements to widget creation or error raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of dynamic imports and type checks are standard for plugin-like support.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines coercion functions to convert visualization objects into ipywidget.Widget instances. It uses import statements with exception handling to support optional dependencies, avoiding crashes if libraries are missing. No network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code performs input validation and type checks, raising informative errors if conversions fail. No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are evident. Overall, the code functions as a plugin interface for visualization libraries, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe utility for coercing visualization objects into ipywidget.Widget instances. It performs standard input validation, conditional imports, and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. The overall security risk is low.",
