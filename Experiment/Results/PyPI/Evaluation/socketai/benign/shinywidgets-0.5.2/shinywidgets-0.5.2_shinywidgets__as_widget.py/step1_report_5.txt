{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to coerce various visualization objects into ipywidget.Widget objects for display in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, ipywidgets, and third-party packages like altair, jupyter_bokeh, plotly, and pydeck.",
  "sinks": "The code mainly calls methods like x.show() for pydeck objects and imports packages for rendering visualization objects.",
  "flows": "The functions import visualization libraries, check object types, and invoke methods (like show) that generate widgets or HTML representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic imports and object coercion is standard for visualization helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code provides multiple coercion functions for different visualization libraries, using import error handling and type checks. No data is sent over the network or stored maliciously. No code injection, data leakage, or system disruption appears present. The use of the show() method in pydeck is expected for rendering maps, with no evidence of malicious behavior. External library imports are conditional and handled gracefully. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard visualization utility module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage indicators.",
