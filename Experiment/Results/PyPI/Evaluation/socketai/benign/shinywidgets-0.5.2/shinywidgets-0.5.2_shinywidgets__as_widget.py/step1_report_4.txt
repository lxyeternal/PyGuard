{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to coerce various data visualization objects into ipywidget.Widget objects for display in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Input objects passed to functions (as_widget, as_widget_altair, as_widget_bokeh, as_widget_plotly, as_widget_pydeck).",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing Widget objects, and exceptions thrown on errors.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow through type checks and conditional coercion functions, ultimately returning Widget instances or raising errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of dynamic imports is standard for optional dependencies. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages type checks and dynamic imports for various visualization libraries. It employs conditional logic to coerce objects into ipywidget widgets, handling import errors gracefully. No network calls or sensitive data handling are present. The functions are straightforward, with no apparent malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for rendering visualization objects in Jupyter notebooks. It dynamically imports visualization libraries, checks object types, and converts them into widgets. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
