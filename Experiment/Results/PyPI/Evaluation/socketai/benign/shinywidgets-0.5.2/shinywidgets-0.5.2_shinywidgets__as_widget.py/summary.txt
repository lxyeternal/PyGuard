  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for converting visualization objects into ipywidget.Widget instances. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for conservativeness, but overall, the code poses minimal security concern."
