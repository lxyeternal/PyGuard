  "purpose": "Configure CDN fallback URLs and warning flags for the shinywidgets package using environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls retrieving environment variables: SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; environment variables influence configuration but do not cause data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to variables that influence CDN URLs and warning flags; no data flow to external systems or malicious payloads",
  "anomalies": "None; the code performs standard environment variable retrieval and assignment without obfuscation or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a tuple of variable names, and retrieves environment variables to set configuration options for CDN URLs and warning flags. The environment variables are used to control CDN sources and warning behaviors. No user input, external data, or suspicious operations are present. The use of environment variables for configuration is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward configuration logic for a Python package, using environment variables to set CDN URLs and warning flags. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code does not contain malware or security risks.",
