  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration variables within the application",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment variable handling with defaults and boolean parsing",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a static list 'all', and reads three environment variables with defaults, converting some to booleans. It performs no code execution, network calls, or data leaks. The logic is simple and aligns with standard configuration practices. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The environment variables are used solely for configuration, with safe defaults. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misconfiguration, but not malicious. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for environment-based settings. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ≈ 0.1. No modifications are necessary.",
