  "purpose": "Configure CDN URLs and warning settings for shinywidgets, based on environment variables",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment variables and assigns values to variables",
  "flows": "Environment variable reads → variable assignments; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; standard environment variable usage for configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a tuple of constant names, and assigns configuration variables based on environment variables with default values. The environment variables are processed securely, converting strings to boolean where appropriate. There are no dynamic code executions, external commands, or insecure operations. All data flows are from trusted sources (environment variables) into local variables without executing untrusted code or connecting to external domains directly. The URLs are used as configuration defaults, not as executed code or data exfiltration points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for CDN URLs and warning flags, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
