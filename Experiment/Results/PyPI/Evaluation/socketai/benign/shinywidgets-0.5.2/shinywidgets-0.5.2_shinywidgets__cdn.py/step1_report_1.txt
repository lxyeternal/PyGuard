  "purpose": "Define configuration variables for CDN fallback URLs and warning flags for shinywidgets extensions, with values read from environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls reading environment variables SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING",
  "sinks": "Environment variable reads influence the behavior of CDN URLs and warning flags; no direct data leak or harmful sink identified",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence the values of SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, and SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING, which are used in the application logic to determine CDN URLs and warnings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward environment variable access with default fallbacks and boolean parsing",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a tuple 'all' with three string identifiers. It then reads three environment variables: SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, and SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING. The first is used as a URL string, with a default pointing to jsDelivr CDN. The second is parsed into a boolean based on the string 'true', as is the third. The code is well-structured, comments provide context, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a widget library, with environment variables controlling CDN URLs and warning flags. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.",
