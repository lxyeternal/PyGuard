{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration variables for CDN URLs and warning flags for the 'shinywidgets' library, allowing customization via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING",
  "sinks": "Environment variable reads; no sinks or data output or external communication beyond variable assignment",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to internal variables without further processing or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'os' module, defines a tuple for configuration, and assigns values based on environment variables with defaults. It uses environment variables to control CDN URL, CDN-only mode, and extension warning flags. No data processing, external network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code appears to facilitate configurable widget setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a Python library, leveraging environment variables for flexibility. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
