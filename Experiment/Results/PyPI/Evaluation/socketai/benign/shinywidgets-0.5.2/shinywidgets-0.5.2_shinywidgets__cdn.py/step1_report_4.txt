{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration settings for CDN fallback URLs and warnings related to a widget extension, with the ability to customize via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SHINYWIDGETS_CDN, SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY, SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING",
  "sinks": "Environment variable access is the only data source; no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code straightforwardly reads environment variables with default values and performs simple boolean conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a tuple of constant strings. It then reads environment variables to configure CDN URLs and warning flags, with appropriate default values. The environment variables are used to override defaults, and boolean flags are determined by string comparison. No external code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is typical for configuration setup, and there are no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet for setting CDN URLs and warning flags via environment variables. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it present security risks beyond standard environment variable usage.",
