  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\nThe provided code is a straightforward configuration snippet that reads environment variables to set CDN URLs and warning flags for the 'shinywidgets' library. It uses `os.getenv()` with defaults, converts certain environment variables to booleans, and contains no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks. The logic is simple, well-commented, and aligns with standard practices for configuration management.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Each Report:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code reads environment variables for CDN URLs and warning flags, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign. The slight security risk score might be due to environment variable reliance, but since no external code execution or data exfiltration is involved, this is acceptable.\n- **Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard environment variable reading with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The zero security risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is straightforward configuration, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard configuration code.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing benign environment variable usage.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), which is acceptable given the reliance on environment variables, but no actual security risk is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No report suggests any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The overall assessment of the code as benign configuration is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (environment variables are external inputs, but they are used safely here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe configuration snippet with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
