  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- It imports `os`.\n- Defines a tuple `all` with three string identifiers.\n- Reads three environment variables:\n  - `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN` (default: CDN URL string)\n  - `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY` (default: false, parsed to boolean)\n  - `SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING` (default: false, parsed to boolean)\n- No code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code is straightforward configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed observations:\n- The code is standard environment variable handling for configuration.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- No data leaks or external network calls beyond reading environment variables.\n- The environment variables influence application behavior but do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as straightforward configuration via environment variables.\n- All assign default values, parse booleans securely, and do not identify any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0).\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (0 or 0.2), consistent with benign configuration code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code.  \n  The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Are the explanations accurate?**  \n  Yes. They correctly identify the code as standard configuration, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n- **Any overestimation?**  \n  No. The risk scores are appropriately low; no reason to increase them.\n\n- **Any underestimation?**  \n  No. The malware scores are correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reviews, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard configuration, no security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe configuration pattern. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept all reports as accurate. The code poses no security threat. The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.",
