{
  "purpose": "Define rendering classes for various visualization widgets, including Altair, Bokeh, Plotly, and Pydeck, with some dependency handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future annotations, type checking, htmltools, and local dependencies; class definitions; method overrides.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly involves untrusted input handling, data output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The only method override adds a dependency widget to a UI element, which is a controlled operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations, conditional imports for type checking, and class hierarchies for rendering widgets. The method auto_output_ui() in render_bokeh adds a dependency component, which is a standard practice for UI assembly. No code appears to execute external commands, handle user input, or perform network operations. The code is well-structured, adheres to typical Python patterns, and contains no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for widget rendering with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs type-based imports, class definitions, and UI element composition without involving any insecure or harmful operations.",
