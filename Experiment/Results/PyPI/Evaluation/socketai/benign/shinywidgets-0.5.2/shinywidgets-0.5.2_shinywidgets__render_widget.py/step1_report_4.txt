{
  "purpose": "This code defines rendering classes for various visualization widgets in a Python project, facilitating integration with different visualization libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports from htmltools, typing, and local dependencies; class definitions; method implementations.",
  "sinks": "Potential UI output (via auto_output_ui), dependency injection (bokeh_dependency), and class inheritance.",
  "flows": "The render_bokeh class calls super().auto_output_ui() and appends a dependency via bokeh_dependency(), indicating flow from method call to dependency injection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage appears consistent with standard widget rendering patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for rendering various visualization widgets, with clear inheritance and method implementations. The only notable operation is in render_bokeh.auto_output_ui(), where a dependency is appended to a UI component. The bokeh_dependency() function is imported and used in a straightforward manner. No untrusted data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard widget setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical widget rendering setup for visualization libraries with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs standard class definitions and method calls related to UI rendering, with no suspicious or malicious actions detected.",
