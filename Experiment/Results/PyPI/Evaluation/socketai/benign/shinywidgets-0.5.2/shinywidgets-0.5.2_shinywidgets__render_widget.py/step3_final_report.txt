  "purpose": "Defines rendering classes for visualization widgets with dependency management, primarily for UI composition.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and the call to bokeh_dependency() within auto_output_ui().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; dependency inclusion is internal and standard.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and dependency appending in render_bokeh.auto_output_ui().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; dependency inclusion is routine.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for various visualization widgets, conditional type imports, and a single dependency inclusion in the render_bokeh class method. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The dependency injection via bokeh_dependency() is standard for UI rendering and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The dependency inclusion is routine and does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The risk score should be set to 0.0 or 0.1 to accurately reflect the benign nature.",
