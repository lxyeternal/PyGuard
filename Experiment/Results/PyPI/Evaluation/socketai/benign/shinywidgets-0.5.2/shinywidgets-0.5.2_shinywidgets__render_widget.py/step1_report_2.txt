  "purpose": "Define rendering classes for various visualization widgets, integrating dependencies and UI components.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially from external libraries and internal dependency modules.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that generate or modify UI components, particularly 'bokeh_dependency()' and 'super().auto_output_ui()'.",
  "flows": "Importing external libraries -> class methods calling 'bokeh_dependency()' and superclass methods, constructing UI elements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of type checking for conditional imports is standard practice. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple widget rendering classes inheriting from a base, with conditional imports for type checking and runtime. The only notable operation is appending a dependency component within 'render_bokeh.auto_output_ui()', which appears to be a legitimate dependency inclusion. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications observed. The code adheres to normal patterns for UI widget rendering, with clear separation of concerns and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for rendering visualization widgets with dependency management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The inclusion of dependencies is expected for UI rendering, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
