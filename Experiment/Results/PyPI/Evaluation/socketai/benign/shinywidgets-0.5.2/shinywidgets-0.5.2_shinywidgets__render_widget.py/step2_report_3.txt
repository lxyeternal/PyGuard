  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward class definitions and imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any network, file, or external command operations. It merely sets up classes and UI components.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment seems accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the only notable operation is appending a dependency widget, which is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None apparent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0.2, which might seem slightly high but can be justified as dependency inclusion.\n- **Justification:** Including dependencies is common and not malicious unless misused. No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code manages dependencies and widget rendering.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, securityRisk is 0.2—acceptable given the dependency management.\n- **Justification:** The inclusion of dependencies via `bokeh_dependency()` is standard; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code defines classes and appends dependencies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, securityRisk is low (0.1).\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; dependency injection is routine.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is purely class and dependency setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, securityRisk is low (0.1).\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; code appears standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard dependency and UI setup with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to dependency inclusion but not risky)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
