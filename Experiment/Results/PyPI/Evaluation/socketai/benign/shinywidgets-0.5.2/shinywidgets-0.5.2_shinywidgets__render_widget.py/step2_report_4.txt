  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, code is straightforward class definitions and imports, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score seems unjustified given the benign nature of the code. The code is purely structural, with no security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard class definitions, dependency inclusion, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Again, the high risk score is unwarranted. The only notable operation is appending a dependency, which is normal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard widget classes, dependency management, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, but still low, reflecting minimal concern. The inclusion of dependencies is typical.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign pattern, no untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate low risk score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same benign structure, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code only involves class definitions, type annotations, and dependency inclusion, which are benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The majority of reports assign high risk scores (0.9–0.95) despite the code being benign. This overestimates the security risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are appropriate at 0.\n- The **risk scores** should be significantly lowered to reflect the benign nature—probably around 0.0 or 0.1—since there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard implementation for rendering visualization widgets with dependency management.\n- No untrusted input handling, network operations, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The inclusion of dependencies like `bokeh_dependency()` is typical for UI rendering and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (or even 0.0 if we want to be conservative)\n\nThis conservative adjustment better aligns with the actual security assessment based on the provided code.",
