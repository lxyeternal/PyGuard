{
  "purpose": "Define rendering classes for various visualization widgets and dependencies in a plotting framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries, especially within conditional TYPE_CHECKING blocks.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is common for type hints to avoid runtime overhead. It defines several classes for rendering different visualization widgets, with one method that appends a dependency Tag in 'render_bokeh'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The overall structure and content are typical for a widget rendering framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a framework for rendering visualization widgets with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
