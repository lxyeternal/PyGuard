{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of rendering classes for various visualization libraries (Altair, Bokeh, Plotly, PyDeck) and manages dependencies for Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads type information (TYPE_CHECKING), imports from internal modules (_dependencies, _render_widget_base), and a function bokeh_dependency().",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the call to bokeh_dependency(), which adds a dependency to the output UI.",
  "flows": "Input type checks lead to conditional imports; the render classes instantiate and extend base classes, and in render_bokeh, the output UI is extended with a dependency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The import statements and class definitions appear standard. The only dynamic operation is appending a dependency object, which is expected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines rendering classes for visualization widgets, conditionally imports type hints for type checking, and includes a method that appends a dependency (bokeh_dependency) to the output UI. The only function that might be noteworthy is bokeh_dependency(), which presumably manages dependency inclusion. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious payloads. All code appears to be standard library and internal module usage for widget rendering in Jupyter environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical widget rendering setup for various visualization libraries with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily manages dependencies and rendering classes. The code appears benign and consistent with normal usage patterns.",
