  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward class definitions, conditional type-checking imports, and no data flow from untrusted sources. The only operation is appending a dependency widget in `render_bokeh.auto_output_ui()`, which is standard for dependency management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — benign code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the `bokeh_dependency()` call. The analysis correctly identifies that appending dependencies is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, similar pattern: class definitions, dependency inclusion via `bokeh_dependency()`, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but still low; perhaps due to dependency inclusion.\n- **Assessment:** The report suggests dependency management but does not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n**Justification for security risk:** Since the only notable operation is dependency inclusion, which is standard, the risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high but still low. It might be justified if the dependency function is untrusted, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity. The risk score could be adjusted downward to 0.1 for better consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no suspicious patterns, just dependency appending.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard class definitions, dependency inclusion, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly at 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern mainly due to dependency inclusion.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Since the code only involves class definitions, conditional imports, and appending dependencies, **the risk scores should be very low**, ideally 0.0 or 0.1, unless there's an untrusted dependency or malicious code.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to dependency inclusion, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code is benign. The scores assigned are reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative regarding the security risk. Given the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious patterns, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard widget rendering setup with dependency management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
