  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external commands, no data handling, straightforward class definitions, and a UI dependency inclusion.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The high confidence aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard class setup, dependency inclusion via `bokeh_dependency()`, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. The security risk score could be slightly increased if considering dependency management as a potential vector, but given the benign nature, remains low.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard widget rendering classes, dependency added in `render_bokeh`. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Analysis:** The security risk is slightly higher (0.2) due to the dependency injection, but it’s still within a benign scope. The malware score remains 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- **Justification:** The dependency inclusion could, in theory, be exploited if `bokeh_dependency()` were malicious, but there's no indication of that. The score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity, straightforward class definitions, dependency injection.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard rendering classes, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward class definitions with dependency management.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to dependency injection, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n- The **security risk** score can be justified as low (around 0.1-0.2), primarily due to dependency inclusion, which is standard but could be a vector if dependencies are malicious—though no evidence suggests that here.\n- The **confidence** levels are appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to dependency management, but no actual risk observed)\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, standard widget rendering setup, with no security concerns.",
