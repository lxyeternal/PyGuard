{
  "purpose": "This code is used to configure and initiate the setup process for a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement 'from setuptools import setup' which imports the setup function, and the call to setup() itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'setup' to executing 'setup()', which would normally process package metadata and prepare the package for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. It is standard setup script code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library and immediately calls setup() with no arguments. This is a common minimal setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or obfuscated logic. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply invokes the setup process with default parameters.",
