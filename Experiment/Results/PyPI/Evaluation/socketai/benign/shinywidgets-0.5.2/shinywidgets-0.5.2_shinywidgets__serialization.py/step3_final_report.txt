{
  "purpose": "Provides custom JSON serialization handling datetime, bytes, iterables, numbers, and decimal.Decimal for safe data serialization, especially in environments like Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from objects passed to json_packer, including datetime, bytes, iterables, numbers, and decimal.Decimal instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not perform external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through json_default, which serializes types to JSON-compatible formats, then through json_packer to produce JSON strings.",
  "anomalies": "The use of warnings.warn() for naive datetime objects is standard practice; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for JSON serialization, handling various data types appropriately. It issues a deprecation warning when naive datetime objects are encountered, encouraging timezone-aware datetimes. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear type handling, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious code. The warning about naive datetime objects is a common best practice and does not introduce security risks. The code does not process untrusted inputs in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for JSON serialization with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. The warning about naive datetime objects is standard and does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
