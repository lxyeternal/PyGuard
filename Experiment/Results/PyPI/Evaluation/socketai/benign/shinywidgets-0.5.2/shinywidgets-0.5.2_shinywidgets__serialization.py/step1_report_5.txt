{
  "purpose": "The code provides JSON serialization functions with custom handling for datetime, bytes, and iterable objects, likely for data processing or communication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from any object passed to json_packer, which internally calls json_default for serialization.",
  "sinks": "The data is serialized into JSON strings, which can be used elsewhere, such as network transmission or file storage.",
  "flows": "Input objects are processed by json_packer, passing through json_default for custom serialization, then output as JSON strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No insecure external calls or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles various data types for JSON serialization, including datetime, bytes, iterables, and numbers. It adds timezone info to naive datetime objects with a warning, which is a standard practice. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behavior. The functions serve as utility methods for data serialization, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe utility for serializing data into JSON with custom handlers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
