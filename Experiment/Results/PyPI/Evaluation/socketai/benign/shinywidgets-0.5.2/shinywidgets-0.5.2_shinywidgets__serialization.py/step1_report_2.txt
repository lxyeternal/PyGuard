{
  "purpose": "Provide JSON serialization with custom handling for datetime, bytes, iterables, and numeric types.",
  "sources": "json_packer() calls json.dumps() with a custom default function; json_default() reads objects of various types (datetime, bytes, iterables, numbers, decimal).",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks. No external data output or network transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "json_packer() passes objects to json.dumps(), which calls json_default() for non-standard objects; json_default() processes specific object types.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn() for naive datetime objects, which is benign and typical for deprecation warnings. No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a custom JSON serializer with specific handlers for datetime, bytes, iterables, and numeric types. It converts datetime objects to ISO format, encoding bytes in base64, and converting other data types to their JSON-compatible forms. The _ensure_tzinfo() function adds timezone info to naive datetime objects, emitting a deprecation warning, which is standard practice. There are no code injection points, no network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common serialization patterns without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard JSON serialization with custom handlers, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for robust data serialization.",
