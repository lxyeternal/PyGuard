  "purpose": "Custom JSON serialization functions for handling various Python objects, including datetime, bytes, iterables, and numbers, for use in data interchange.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from objects passed to json_packer, particularly during serialization of datetime, bytes, iterable, and numeric objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data externally; it only serializes data to JSON strings.",
  "flows": "Input objects are processed through json_default, which transforms specific types for JSON serialization, then passed to json_packer for final serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected. Usage of warnings for naive datetime is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom JSON serialization with careful handling of datetime objects (adding timezone info if missing), bytes (base64 encoding), iterables (list conversion), and numeric types (int/float conversion). There are no external data transmissions, no obfuscated logic, and no suspicious patterns. The only noteworthy aspect is the warning for naive datetime objects, which is a standard data validation practice. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on data serialization tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign JSON serialization utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
