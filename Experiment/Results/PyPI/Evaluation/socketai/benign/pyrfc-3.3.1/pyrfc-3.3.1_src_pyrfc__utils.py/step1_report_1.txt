  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to extract names and values from an enum object.",
  "sources": "Enum object passed as argument to enum_names and enum_values functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating sets of enum attribute names and values.",
  "flows": "Input enum object -> functions -> return sets of names/values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The license comment is standard and does not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions that extract enum names and values by iterating over the enum object. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no insecure operations, or dynamic code execution. The license comments are standard and unrelated to malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and purely utility-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
