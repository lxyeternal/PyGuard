  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to extract names and values from an enum object.",
  "sources": "Input enum_obj parameter passed to functions enum_names and enum_values.",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating sets from enum object attributes.",
  "flows": "Input enum_obj -> set comprehension -> return sets of names/values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple utility functions that operate on enum objects, extracting either their 'name' or 'value' attributes into sets. It uses straightforward set comprehensions without any external data processing, external calls, or dynamic execution. The comments clarify purpose, and SPDX license identifiers indicate licensing but not malicious intent. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears purely for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for enum introspection with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
