  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines two simple utility functions:\n- `enum_names(enum_obj)` returns a set of all `name` attributes from enum members.\n- `enum_values(enum_obj)` returns a set of all `value` attributes from enum members.\n\nThe code is straightforward, with no external inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as benign, utility functions for enum introspection.\n- They note the absence of malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The reasoning is consistent: simple set comprehensions over enum members, with standard licensing comments.\n- The confidence level is 1 for all, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Scores:**\n- `malware`: 0 — consistent across all reports, aligns with the code.\n- `securityRisk`: 0 — no security risks identified.\n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is simple, well-structured, and clearly utility-oriented.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The scores are reasonable; given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, a malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Higher risk scores?**  \n  Not justified. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a benign utility module for enum introspection, with no security or malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is safe, simple, and does not pose any security or malware risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
