  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to extract names and values from an Enum object.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'enum_obj' passed to the functions 'enum_names' and 'enum_values'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external sources, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input enum object flows into functions, which return sets derived from its members' 'name' and 'value' attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions to extract names and values from Enum objects. The functions iterate over enum members and create sets of 'name' and 'value' attributes, respectively. The code includes SPDX licensing comments, which are standard for open-source projects. No input/output, external communication, or potentially malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated logic. It appears to be utility code for enum introspection, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign utility functions for Enum processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is standard, well-structured, and safe.",
