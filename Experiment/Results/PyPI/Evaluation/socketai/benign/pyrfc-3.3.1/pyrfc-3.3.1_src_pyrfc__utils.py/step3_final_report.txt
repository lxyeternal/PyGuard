  "flows": "Input enum object -> iteration over enum members -> extraction of name/value attributes -> return sets.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions that iterate over enum members to extract their 'name' and 'value' attributes, returning them as sets. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is well-structured, clear, and standard for enum introspection. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The license comments are standard and do not influence security. The functions perform read-only operations on enum objects, with no side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for enum introspection with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.",
