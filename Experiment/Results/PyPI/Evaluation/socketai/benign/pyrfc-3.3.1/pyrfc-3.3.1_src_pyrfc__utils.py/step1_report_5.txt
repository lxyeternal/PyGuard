  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to extract names and values from enum objects.",
  "sources": "None; the code only processes input parameters (enum objects).",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions that iterate over enum objects to extract their names and values. It includes only docstrings and license comments at the top, with no embedded or dynamic code, no external input handling, and no security-sensitive operations. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The license comments are standard and do not influence code security. The functions perform basic set comprehensions over enum members, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for enum processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
