  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the code is benign utility functions with no malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: The functions are straightforward, only extracting enum member names and values, with no external data, network activity, or code injection. The license comments are standard.  \n- **Assessment:** The scoring seems appropriate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: Same reasoning—simple set comprehensions over enum members, no external effects.  \n- **Assessment:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, describes straightforward utility functions.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: No signs of malicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same conclusion: benign utility functions.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: Clear, simple code with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as above; utility functions with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: Straightforward, standard code.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is simple and correct; no bugs or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None observed or implied.  \n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and readable; no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Security risk:** None, as the functions are read-only and do not process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The current scores of **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, and **securityRisk=0** are justified and reasonable.  \n- The reports are consistent in their conclusions, and the code's benign nature is well established.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or indicators)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple utility module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
