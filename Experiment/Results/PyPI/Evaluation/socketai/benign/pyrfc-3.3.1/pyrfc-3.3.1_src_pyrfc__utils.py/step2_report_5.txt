  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code consists of two functions:\n```python\ndef enum_names(enum_obj):\n    \"\"\"Enum object names.\"\"\"\n    return {en.name for en in enum_obj}\n\ndef enum_values(enum_obj):\n    \"\"\"Enum object values.\"\"\"\n    return {en.value for en in enum_obj}\n```\nThese functions simply extract the `name` and `value` attributes from enum members, returning them as sets. The code is straightforward, with no external input/output, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports confirm that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are utility-oriented and do not perform any harmful operations.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code appears correct and idiomatic for working with Python enums. No logical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n  These are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None are higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code is purely utility functions with no malicious intent, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Is there any overlooked risk?**  \n  No. The code is simple, standard, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.\n\n- **Is there any obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Are the license comments relevant?**  \n  They are standard SPDX comments, not influencing security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a simple utility for enum introspection with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and free of security issues.",
