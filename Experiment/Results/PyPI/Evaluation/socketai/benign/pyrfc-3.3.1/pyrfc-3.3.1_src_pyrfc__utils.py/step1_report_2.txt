  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to extract names and values from enum objects.",
  "sources": "Input is the enum_obj parameter passed to functions enum_names and enum_values.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions return sets derived from enum_obj without external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from enum_obj input to set comprehension results, but no external or untrusted data source is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions are straightforward and do not perform unusual or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that operate on enum objects, extracting their 'name' and 'value' attributes. There are no external data reads, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The SPDX licensing comments are standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a simple utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for working with enum objects, with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
