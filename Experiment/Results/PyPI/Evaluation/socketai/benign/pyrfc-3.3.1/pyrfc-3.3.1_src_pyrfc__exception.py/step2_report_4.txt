  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code to verify the accuracy of their assessments.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes and enums for SAP RFC errors.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes that the code is class and enum definitions, with no data sinks, external input, or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malware or security risks detected.\n- Confidence: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely structural, with no suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes and enums.\n- Analysis: Correctly states that the code involves no data input/output or external data handling.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risk.\n- Confidence: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for SAP RFC errors, including an enum.\n- Analysis: Correctly describes the static nature of the code, with no dynamic or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence: 1.0, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with string formatting for error messages.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies that the string representation is static and no external data is involved.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar exception and enum definitions.\n- Analysis: Notes that error messages could potentially expose internal details if misused, but no external data or malicious activity is present.\n- Conclusion: No malware, but security risk is noted as 0.1, possibly due to the potential for error message exposure.\n- Confidence: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The code itself does not contain malicious code, but the error messages could, in a different context, expose sensitive info if misused. However, in this static code, no actual sensitive data is present.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes and enums for SAP RFC error handling.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The only minor point is the potential for error message exposure, but as implemented, the messages are static and do not contain sensitive data.\n\n**Final Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- Malware: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated: **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- Risk Score: Given the nature of the code, a risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** could be justified, mainly due to the potential for error message exposure if misused, but in the context of this static code, it's negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and does not pose security risks.\n- The scores provided are consistent with the analysis.\n- I would assign a **malware score of 0**, an **obfuscated score of 0**, and a **risk score of approximately 0.1**, considering the potential for error message exposure in a different context.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and thorough; no further action needed.",
