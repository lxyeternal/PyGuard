  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of error handling classes and enums for SAP RFC interactions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The slight potential for error message exposure is a common and non-malicious concern, justified by the static nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
