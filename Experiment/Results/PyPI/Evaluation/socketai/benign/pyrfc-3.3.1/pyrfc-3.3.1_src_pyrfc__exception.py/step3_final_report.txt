  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and enums for SAP RFC error handling.",
  "sources": "Internal variables within exception classes, particularly in __str__ method formatting error messages.",
  "sinks": "Potential logging or display of error messages that could expose internal details if misused.",
  "flows": "Error object attributes (message, code, key, etc.) used in string representation for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal variables in __str__ could, in a different context, leak internal details; no external input handling or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum definitions for error handling in SAP RFC interactions. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The __str__ method formats internal attributes, which are static and controlled, so no data injection or malicious behavior is present. The minor concern about error message exposure is standard for error reporting and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of error handling classes and enums for SAP RFC interactions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The slight potential for error message exposure is a common and non-malicious concern, justified by the static nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
