  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and enums for SAP RFC error handling. No data sinks, external input, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Assessment:** The code consists solely of class and enum definitions, with no dynamic or external data processing. The analysis is accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as a safe, standard error handling module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is straightforward and free of suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Confirmed. No external data, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the exception class hierarchy and enum of RFC codes, with no external data or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely class definitions and enum constants, with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of string formatting in __str__, potential for error message exposure, but no external data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The string representation uses internal variables only, no external inputs or data leaks.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that error messages could potentially expose internal details if misused, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The only concern is the potential exposure of internal error details via __str__, which is a standard pattern but could be misused if error messages are logged insecurely.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — a very low, non-malicious concern about information exposure, not an active security flaw.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; the slight concern about error message exposure is standard and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (error classes and enums), a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted. The only minor concern is potential information leakage via error messages, but this is a common pattern and not a security flaw.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling module for a Python SAP connector.\n- No changes to the reported scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal concern about error message exposure, but not a security risk.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its intended purpose.",
