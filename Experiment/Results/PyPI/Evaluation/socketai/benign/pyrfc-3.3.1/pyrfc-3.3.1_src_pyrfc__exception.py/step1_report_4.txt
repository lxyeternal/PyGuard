{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SAP RFC (Remote Function Call) interactions within a Python connector.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'enum' and 'pyrfc._utils'; class methods and constructors; enum values for return codes.",
  "sinks": "String representation method (__str__) that formats error details; potential logging or display of error messages.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with various parameters and then converted to string for output; no untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic; all code appears standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes tailored for SAP RFC errors, with detailed attributes for error codes, messages, and groups. It includes an enumeration of RFC return codes for interpretive purposes. No input reading, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. The string conversion method uses static formatting without external inputs. Overall, the structure aligns with conventional error handling in Python and does not exhibit any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for SAP RFC error handling, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely to define error classes and formatting, with no active or hidden malicious actions.",
