  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and enums for handling SAP RFC errors in a Python connector.",
  "sources": "No input reading, just class and enum definitions; no data sources or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines error classes and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum definitions for exception handling related to SAP RFC errors. It includes detailed exception classes, some with default parameters, and an enum listing return codes. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be standard error handling and does not perform any network communication, data storage, or external system interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions and enums for SAP RFC error handling. There is no malicious intent or security risk present. The code is well-structured and appears safe.",
