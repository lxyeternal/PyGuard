{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to SAP RFC (Remote Function Call) operations in a Python connector, including error codes and messages.",
  "sources": "The code imports external modules 'enum' and 'pyrfc._utils', and defines exception classes and an enum, with no direct data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that process untrusted input; exception messages are constructed from internal variables, not external input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; error handling is based on internal variables and predefined enums.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward exception class definitions, with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions and an enum for RFC return codes. All classes inherit from built-in exceptions or a base RFCError, and there are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The use of super() and class attributes is standard. The only dynamic element is the __str__ method in RFCLibError, which formats an error message based on internal variables, none of which are sourced externally. The enum defines error codes for SAP RFC operations and does not contain any suspicious or malicious content. Overall, the code appears to be a typical error handling module for a Python SAP connector, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured exception classes and an enumeration for RFC error codes, with no malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks detected. It is a standard error handling implementation without obfuscated or malicious code elements.",
