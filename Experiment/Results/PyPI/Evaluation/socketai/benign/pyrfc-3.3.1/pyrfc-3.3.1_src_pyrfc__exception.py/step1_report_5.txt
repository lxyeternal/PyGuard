  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and enumeration for handling RFC-related errors in a Python SAP connector.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute initializations, enum definitions, and string formatting methods.",
  "sinks": "String representation (__str__) of errors that could potentially expose internal error details if misused.",
  "flows": "Error data flows from exception raising to string conversion, but no untrusted data inputs or external data sources are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured exception classes with detailed attributes and an enum for return codes. No user inputs, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or secret handling are present. The error handling appears standard and isolated to exception management, with string representations for error messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions and error codes for an SAP RFC connector. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
