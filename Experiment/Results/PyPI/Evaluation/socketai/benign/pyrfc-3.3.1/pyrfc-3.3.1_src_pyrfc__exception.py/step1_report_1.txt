{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and enums related to SAP RFC errors for use in a Python SAP connector library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code includes data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily class definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution. Exception classes do not process external input directly. Enum values are static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class and enum definitions for handling SAP RFC errors, with exception classes tailored to specific error groups. No user input is processed, no external data is read or written, and no network or file operations are present. The code appears to be a library component for error handling, with no malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious definition of exception classes and enums for SAP RFC error handling. No indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.",
