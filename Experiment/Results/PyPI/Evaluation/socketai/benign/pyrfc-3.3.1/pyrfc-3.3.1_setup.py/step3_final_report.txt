{
  "purpose": "Build setup script for the 'pyrfc' Python package, configuring environment-specific compilation and linking options for native SAP RFC SDK dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SAPNWRFC_HOME' and 'PYTHONSOURCE' used to determine SDK paths; platform-specific compile and link arguments; import of 'inspect' for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed into security-sensitive operations; no network or data exfiltration; no code injection or dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence include and library paths; no data flows from untrusted sources into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward build configuration; no obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs platform-specific setup for building a Cython extension, relying on environment variables for SDK locations. It validates critical variables and configures compiler/linker flags accordingly. No runtime data processing, network activity, or code injection is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for build scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Reliance on environment variables is standard practice and does not indicate malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal.",
