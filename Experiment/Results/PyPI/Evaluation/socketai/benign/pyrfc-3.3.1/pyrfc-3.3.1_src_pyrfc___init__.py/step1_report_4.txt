{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and sets up the pyrfc package, including importing modules, handling environment-specific configurations, and importing core classes and functions for RFC communication with SAP systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (SAPNWRFC_HOME), imports from internal modules (_exception, _cyrfc), and attempts to load a native library via importlib.metadata and os modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly; it primarily loads modules, manages environment variables, and handles exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable SAPNWRFC_HOME flows into os.add_dll_directory; imports from internal modules are straightforward and do not process untrusted data; exception handling flows from import failure to printing the exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The try-except block only logs import errors rather than executing malicious actions. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup tasks: retrieving version info, modifying DLL search paths on Windows, importing modules, and handling import errors. All operations are standard for package initialization. No indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code paths. The only notable activity is environment variable usage to modify DLL loading paths, which is typical for native library integration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate package initialization script for pyrfc, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard environment setup and module imports without processing untrusted data or executing harmful actions.",
