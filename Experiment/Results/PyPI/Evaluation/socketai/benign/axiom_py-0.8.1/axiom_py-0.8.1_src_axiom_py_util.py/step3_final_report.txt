  "sources": "Data input to from_dict, handle_json_serialization, is_personal_token functions",
  "sinks": "None; no external calls, network activity, or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Input data -> from_dict (deserialization), data -> handle_json_serialization (serialization), token string -> is_personal_token (validation)",
  "anomalies": "Import of 're' inside a function (_convert_string_to_timedelta), which is unconventional but benign",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling: parsing datetime and timedelta from strings, deserializing data with dacite, serializing objects to JSON-compatible formats, and simple token validation. No external network calls, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious patterns detected. Regex usage is straightforward and safe. The deserialization step could pose a risk if input data is malicious, but no malicious payloads are present. The import inside a function is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code is a benign utility module with very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor deserialization risk is inherent to such functions but does not indicate malicious intent. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
