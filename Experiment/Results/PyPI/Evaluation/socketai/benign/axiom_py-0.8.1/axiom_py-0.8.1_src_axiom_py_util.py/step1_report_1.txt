  "purpose": "Utility functions for data conversion, deserialization, and JSON serialization in a query handling context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries; functions that read data from arguments and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involving untrusted data being sent or written out in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'data' in from_dict) flows through deserialization functions, with potential conversion functions acting as intermediate steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for parsing timedelta; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external calls; standard serialization functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data conversion utilities for date/time parsing, timedelta conversion, deserialization using dacite, and serialization to JSON-compatible formats. The functions operate on provided data, performing type conversions and serializations without executing or executing external commands. No network activity, file operations, or untrusted input handling that could be malicious are evident. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of regex is safe here, serving for format parsing. Overall, this code appears to be utility functions typical for data handling, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data conversion and serialization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful operations, network activity, or contain backdoors. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
