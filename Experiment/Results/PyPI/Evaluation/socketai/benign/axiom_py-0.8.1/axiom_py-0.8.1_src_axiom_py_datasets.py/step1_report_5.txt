{
  "purpose": "Provides a client for managing datasets via REST API, including creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and trimming datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API responses from the session.get/post/put/delete methods.",
  "sinks": "The code serializes data to JSON with ujson.dumps() for API requests; it also deserializes JSON responses from the API.",
  "flows": "API responses (res.json()) are converted to Dataset objects via from_dict; request data is constructed from dataclasses and serialized with ujson.dumps() before sending to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of ujson and requests appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models and a client class to interact with a REST API for dataset management. Methods build request payloads using data classes, serialize them with ujson, and send HTTP requests. Responses are parsed and converted to Dataset objects. No evidence of malicious data handling, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual operations are present. The code structure is typical for API client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, straightforward API client for dataset management with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It relies on external libraries in a typical manner and performs expected operations without suspicious activities.",
