{
  "purpose": "Provides a client interface to manage datasets via REST API calls, including creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and trimming datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data from external API responses and function parameters such as dataset IDs, names, descriptions, and timedelta objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses session methods (get, post, put, delete) that send data over network; data payloads are constructed from function inputs and internal objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like dataset IDs, descriptions, maxDuration) flow into HTTP request payloads; responses are parsed into Dataset objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of 'ujson' and 'requests' is standard; no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for datasets and client methods to interact with a REST API. The functions construct JSON payloads from input parameters and send them over network. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive info are present. The session object manages HTTP communication. The trim method formats a timedelta into a string with seconds suffix; this is straightforward. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for dataset management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module. It handles data securely and follows standard patterns.",
