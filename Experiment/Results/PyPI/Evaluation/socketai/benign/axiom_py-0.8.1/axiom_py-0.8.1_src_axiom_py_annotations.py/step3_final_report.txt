{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for managing annotations via REST API calls, providing methods to get, create, list, update, and delete annotations, using standard libraries and data models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (e.g., id, datasets, request objects), and API responses via session.get/post/put/delete calls.",
  "sinks": "API responses are deserialized into data models; no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction and request bodies; responses flow back into data models via from_dict, completing source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Lack of input validation could be noted but isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with straightforward data flow, using common libraries. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The session object is external and assumed secure. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given its external interactions, but no vulnerabilities are evident. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
