{
  "purpose": "This package provides models and methods to create, retrieve, update, list, and delete annotations via a REST API.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses (res.json()), user input via method parameters (id, req), environment variables not used, and data from external API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (session.get, post, put, delete) with data payloads, and JSON deserialization of API responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API responses into internal data structures via from_dict(), and data sent in requests via ujson.dumps().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. Usage of external libraries (ujson, requests) is standard. No obfuscation or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical API client with well-structured data models. The request and response handling use standard libraries and methods. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is observed. All network interactions are with presumably trusted API endpoints, and there are no hidden or obfuscated parts. The code's purpose is straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for managing annotations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a standard REST API client without suspicious features.",
