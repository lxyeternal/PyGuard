{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface for managing annotations through REST API endpoints, including creating, retrieving, listing, updating, and deleting annotations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API responses (res.json()), request payloads (via asdict(req)), and URL parameters (datasets, start, end).",
  "sinks": "Data sent via session.post() and session.put() calls, and the data received from session.get() responses that are parsed and processed.",
  "flows": "Input data (from API responses or user inputs) is serialized to JSON and sent over HTTP requests. Responses are parsed from JSON back into data objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ujson for JSON serialization, standard API interactions; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no suspicious URL domains or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward API client for annotation management, following typical patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Data serialization and HTTP requests are handled securely with standard libraries. No untrusted data manipulation outside of API response parsing, and no signs of data exfiltration or command execution. The code does not perform any unsafe operations such as eval or subprocess calls, nor does it include any hidden code or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client for annotation management with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It utilizes common libraries and straightforward request handling, posing no apparent security risks.",
