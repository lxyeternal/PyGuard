  "purpose": "A processor for buffering and sending structlog events to an external Axiom client.",
  "sources": "The event_dict parameter in __call__, which is appended to the buffer.",
  "sinks": "The client.ingest_events method, which transmits buffered events to an external system.",
  "flows": "event_dict is copied and appended to buffer -> buffer is flushed either when size exceeds 1000 or time interval passes -> buffer is sent via client.ingest_events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward log batching mechanism with periodic flushing. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external client is assumed safe. The only potential concern is data leakage if sensitive info is stored in event_dict, but this is usage-dependent, not a flaw. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility that buffers and transmits events. No malicious or obfuscated elements are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to data handling, which depends on context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by potential data leakage concerns but not a flaw in the code itself.",
