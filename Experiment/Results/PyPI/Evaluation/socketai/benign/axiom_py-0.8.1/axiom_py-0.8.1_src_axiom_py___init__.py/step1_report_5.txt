{
  "purpose": "This code defines an __init__ module for a Python package, organizing imports and exposing public API components for an Axiom Python client library.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from internal modules (.client, .datasets, .annotations) via import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; no data is read from external sources, no user input handling, no network operations, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a straightforward package initializer with standard import/export patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script solely manages imports from internal modules and aggregates them into a list (_all_) for public API exposure. There are no code execution, data processing, or external data handling activities. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation mechanisms are present. It functions as a clean organizational file with no apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It merely organizes and exposes components of the package.",
