{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator, importing classes and exceptions from internal modules (.client, .datasets, .annotations) and consolidating them into an __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports (.client, .datasets, .annotations).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs static imports and aggregation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and exceptions from internal modules and creates an export list. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py, serving organizational purposes. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module aggregator with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
