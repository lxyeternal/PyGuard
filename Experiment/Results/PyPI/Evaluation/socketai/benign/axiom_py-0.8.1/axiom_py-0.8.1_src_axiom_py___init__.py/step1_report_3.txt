{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and constants related to an Axiom Python client, likely used for interacting with a data or analytics service.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local modules (.client, .datasets, .annotations) via import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, as the code only imports and aggregates class references into a list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and creating an __all__ list. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module that imports specific classes and constants from relative modules and aggregates them into a list called __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. The import statements appear standard, importing classes that are likely used elsewhere in the application. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module that imports and exports classes and constants. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
