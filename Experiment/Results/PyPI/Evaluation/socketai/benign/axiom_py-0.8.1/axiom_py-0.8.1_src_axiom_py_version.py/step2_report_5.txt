  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, functions, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is benign, boilerplate code.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data manipulation, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious claims are made; all assessments are consistent and based on the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a typical version declaration with no issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security assessment confirms that this code snippet is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
