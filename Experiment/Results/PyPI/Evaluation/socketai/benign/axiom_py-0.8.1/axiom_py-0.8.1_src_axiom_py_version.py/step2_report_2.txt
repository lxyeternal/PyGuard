  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input, data flow, or suspicious behavior is observed.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports confidently identify the code as benign with no malicious or suspicious elements, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a typical version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed in the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
