  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. The code snippet is straightforward and contains no input handling, no data flow, no external calls, and no suspicious behavior. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present in this code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that this is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1 and scores for obfuscated, malware, and security risk as 0. This seems reasonable given the simplicity of the code. Since all reports agree, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNone of the reports suggest any risk higher than 0.5, and given the code's simplicity, this is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nAll reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll claims are based on factual analysis of the code snippet, with no assumptions about behavior. They are accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThis code is a standard practice in Python packaging—assigning a version string to `__version__`. It does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, and no further action or concern is necessary.",
