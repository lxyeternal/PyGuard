  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or other behaviors. This is a standard practice in Python packages and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Suggestions**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n   - **Confidence**: Perfect (1), as the analysis is straightforward.  \n   \n   **Recommendation**: The scores seem reasonable and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no inputs, outputs, or behaviors that could be exploited, there is no basis for assigning a higher risk score. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**:  \n   No assumptions are made beyond the code's simplicity. The reports correctly identify that this is standard version declaration code with no vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency and Final Estimation**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. Given the simplicity, I concur with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risk present.\n\nThis code snippet is benign, standard, and carries no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
