  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward data class defining query options with no dynamic or external data handling. The code imports standard modules and a local `query` module, setting default values for three fields. There are no signs of user input, network activity, or file operations. No issues or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   No logical errors or flaws are identified across the reports. The code appears correct and idiomatic for defining such a data structure.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \n   Since the code is purely a data container with no dynamic execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns, there is no justification for increasing the risk score above 0.5. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities. They focus solely on the code's structure and intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign configuration class with no security concerns.**",
