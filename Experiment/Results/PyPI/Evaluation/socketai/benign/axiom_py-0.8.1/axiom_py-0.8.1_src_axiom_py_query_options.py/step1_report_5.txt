{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for query options including streaming duration, cache control, and query saving options.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'datetime', 'dataclasses', and a local module '.query'. No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows to sensitive or dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical sinks; the code mainly defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a data class with three fields: 'streamingDuration' (timedelta), 'nocache' (bool), and 'saveAsKind' (QueryKind). It imports standard modules and a local query module. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data reads, or sensitive operations. The default values are set logically. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data class definition intended for configuring query options. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
