  "purpose": "Defines a data class for query options including streaming duration, cache control, and save kind.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime, dataclasses, and a local query module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class fields to potential query operations but no actual data processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a data class 'QueryOptions' with three fields: 'streamingDuration' of type timedelta, 'nocache' as a boolean, and 'saveAsKind' as a QueryKind enum. The default values are set appropriately. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no risky operations. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration container for query parameters, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
