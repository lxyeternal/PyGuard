  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'QueryOptions' for configuring query parameters such as streaming duration, cache behavior, and query kind.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules and a local 'query' module; no external data inputs or dynamic data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static data class with default values only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static data class defining query options with default values. It imports only standard modules and a local 'query' module, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely configuration, and it does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration data class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
