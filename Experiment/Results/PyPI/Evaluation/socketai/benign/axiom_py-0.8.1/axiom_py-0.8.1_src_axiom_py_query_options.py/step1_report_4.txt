  "purpose": "Define a data class for query options including streaming duration, cache control, and save kind.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data fetching is present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward and conventional, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class 'QueryOptions' with three fields: 'streamingDuration' (a timedelta), 'nocache' (a boolean), and 'saveAsKind' (a QueryKind enum). All fields have default values. The code imports only standard modules and a local QueryKind. There are no input/output operations, no network interactions, and no malicious code or suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard configuration class used in a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply models query options with no apparent security concerns.",
