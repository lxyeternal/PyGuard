  "purpose": "Define a data structure for query options, including streaming duration, cache control, and save type.",
  "sources": "Importing timedelta, dataclass, field, and QueryKind; reading default values for class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; no sinks related to external data or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines a class structure with defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a data class with three fields, using standard Python features. It imports standard modules and a local module 'query'. No user input, network activity, or file operations are present. The default values are set appropriately, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data class definition intended to hold query options. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
