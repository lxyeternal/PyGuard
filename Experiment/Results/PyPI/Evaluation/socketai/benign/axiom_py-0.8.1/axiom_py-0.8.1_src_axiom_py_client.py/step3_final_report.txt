  "purpose": "This code provides a Python client library for connecting to the Axiom API, handling data ingestion, querying, and related operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for tokens and organization IDs, API responses, function parameters, request payloads.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to the Axiom API, error handling routines, response parsing.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, function parameters) flow into request headers, payloads, and parameters; responses are processed and converted into data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client utilizing environment variables for credentials, with proper error handling, retries, and data serialization. No malicious routines, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of environment variables aligns with best practices for secret management. The request and response handling follow typical patterns, and no signs of malicious payloads or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent client library with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects standard practices. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
