{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client library for connecting to the Axiom API, enabling data ingestion, querying, and management of datasets, users, and annotations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AXIOM_TOKEN, AXIOM_ORG_ID), user-provided parameters, API responses, and input data for ingestion and queries.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints where data is sent via POST requests, including ingestion endpoints with payloads possibly containing user data, and error handling that raises exceptions based on API responses.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or function parameters flows into API request payloads or headers, which are transmitted over network to Axiom's servers; responses are processed and converted into internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code uses environment variables for sensitive data; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution patterns; error handling seems standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard API client with features such as retries, error handling, data serialization, and secure communication via HTTPS. It properly manages credentials via environment variables, sets appropriate headers, and handles responses with error checking. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present. The ingestion methods handle data securely with gzip compression; query methods interact with API endpoints correctly. No suspicious behaviors like covert network activity, data theft, or backdoors are evident. The code appears well-structured and focused solely on API interactions. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a legitimate client library for the Axiom API with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard security practices, manages credentials securely, and has no hidden or suspicious behaviors.",
