  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Python client for Axiom, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Uses environment variables for credentials, handles errors properly, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious behavior detected; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Very low, consistent with a standard client library.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper handling of credentials via environment variables, no suspicious code, no backdoors, standard practices.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard API client, no malicious code, secure handling of credentials.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard client library, no signs of malicious activity, proper handling of environment variables, retries, error handling.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—legitimate client library, no malicious behavior, secure credential management.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and based on the code review, there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The majority of reports assign very low risk scores (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical API client library, handling authentication via environment variables, performing data serialization, retries, and error handling.  \n- No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present.  \n- The functions serve their intended purposes without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to 0.2, consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
