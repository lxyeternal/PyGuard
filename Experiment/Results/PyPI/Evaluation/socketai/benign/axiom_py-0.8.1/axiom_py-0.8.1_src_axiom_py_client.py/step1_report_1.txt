{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python client library for connecting to Axiom's API, facilitating data ingestion and querying operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AXIOM_TOKEN, AXIOM_ORG_ID), user-supplied parameters, and API response data.",
  "sinks": "API requests (POST/GET), logging of errors, and response handling that could potentially leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or function parameters → API request headers and payloads → API responses → error handling or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; usage of standard libraries and patterns; no unusual code structures. The only notable aspect is the logging of error messages and response data, which is standard. No suspicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client implementation that manages sessions, retries, and request handling. It uses environment variables for tokens, performs error handling by raising exceptions on HTTP errors, and encapsulates functionality for ingesting data and querying datasets. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are observed. The functions appear to serve their intended purposes, with standard use of libraries like requests, ndjson, gzip, and json. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious code execution. The structure is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns and no signs of code injection or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured client library for interacting with Axiom's API. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior was identified. It relies on common libraries and practices, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The overall security risk is very low.",
