  "purpose": "Client library for interacting with Axiom Users service to retrieve current user info.",
  "sources": "Reading session data via self.session.get() in the current() method.",
  "sinks": "res.json() data returned from the GET request, used in from_dict() to create User object.",
  "flows": "session.get() fetches user data, which is processed by from_dict() to instantiate a User object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Role and User, and a client class to fetch current user info. It uses the requests library for HTTP requests and a custom from_dict function for deserialization. The method current() fetches user data only if has_personal_token is True, preventing unnecessary calls otherwise. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or data leaks are evident. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical client implementation for a REST API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external data handling functions (from_dict) but does not incorporate any dangerous or suspicious logic.",
