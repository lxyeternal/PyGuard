  "purpose": "Fetches current user data from the API endpoint '/v2/user' and deserializes it into a User object.",
  "sources": "The HTTP GET request to '/v2/user' and the JSON response processed by 'from_dict'.",
  "sinks": "The 'res.json()' data passed to 'from_dict' which creates a User object.",
  "flows": "API response -> JSON data -> 'from_dict' deserialization -> User object returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward API call and deserialization. Reliance on external 'from_dict' utility, assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Role and User, and a client class 'UsersClient' that conditionally makes an API call to retrieve user info. It uses a session object for HTTP requests and deserializes JSON data into a User object via 'from_dict'. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's logic is simple and standard for API clients. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The reliance on 'from_dict' is a potential point if it were malicious, but in the absence of evidence, it is considered safe. Overall, the code appears secure, with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure API client that retrieves user data without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and function.",
