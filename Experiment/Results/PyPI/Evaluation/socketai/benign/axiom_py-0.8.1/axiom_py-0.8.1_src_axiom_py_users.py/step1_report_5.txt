{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for user roles and user information, and provides a client class to fetch current user data from an API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the API response via res.json() in the current() method.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data from the API response (res.json()) is processed by from_dict to instantiate a User object.",
  "flows": "API response data -> res.json() -> from_dict(User, ...) -> User object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious activity detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward API client to fetch user information. It uses the requests library for HTTP requests and processes the JSON response via from_dict. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code properly checks for token type before making requests. The from_dict function’s implementation is not shown, but assuming it correctly deserializes JSON into data classes without executing arbitrary code, the risk remains low. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for user data retrieval, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs expected operations safely under typical assumptions.",
