{
  "purpose": "Provides a client class for interacting with the Axiom Users API, specifically to retrieve the current user's data.",
  "sources": "Reading session data via self.session.get('/v2/user') and calling res.json() to parse response data.",
  "sinks": "Passing untrusted data from res.json() into from_dict() which constructs a User object.",
  "flows": "API response data -> res.json() -> from_dict(User, data) -> User object",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation. Usage of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a client with a session object and conditionally fetches the current user info from an API endpoint. The only external input is the API response, which is parsed into a User dataclass. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code relies on an external 'from_dict' function, but no evidence suggests it is malicious or suspicious. The structure is straightforward and typical for API client code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and standard for an API client fetching user data. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
