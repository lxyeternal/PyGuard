  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools', reads a 'README.rst' file, and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, no user input processing, no network activity, and no untrusted data handling.\n- The code is straightforward, common, and adheres to standard packaging practices.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The email address contains a '+', which is a common email alias pattern, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None identified.\n- **Security flaws:** None identified.\n- **Code mistakes:** None apparent.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code performs only package setup tasks without any dynamic or untrusted data handling, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n- No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present to warrant a higher score.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid making assumptions about the code's purpose; they recognize it as a standard setup script.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. It reads a local README file and passes static metadata to 'setup()'—nothing suspicious or risky.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
