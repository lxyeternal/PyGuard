  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Package setup, reading README for description.  \n- Sources: Reading a local file, no untrusted input.  \n- Sinks: None, static data.  \n- Flows: Static data passing to setup().  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard packaging script, no dynamic code, no network, no untrusted data.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious intent.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Static file read.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Static data.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no dynamic or untrusted data handling.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard practice.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Packaging script, similar to above.  \n- Sources: Reading README.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Static data passing.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: No security issues.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Packaging setup.  \n- Sources: Reading README.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Static data.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no dynamic or malicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Packaging setup.  \n- Sources: Reading README.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Static data.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard, no suspicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: No security issues.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code reads a local README file and passes static metadata to `setup()`, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The consistent and appropriate scoring across all reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no security concerns. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
