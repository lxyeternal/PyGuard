{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script that reads a README file and calls setup() with static metadata for packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the local file 'README.rst' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; static data passed to setup(), no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static file content flows from open() into the variable 'long_description', then passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the script contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a local README file, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. There is no dynamic execution, user input, or untrusted data handling. The code is straightforward, common in Python packaging, and adheres to best practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
