  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'simplefix' Python library, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; static package configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. No execution of external commands or processing of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' and passing static data to setup() without involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and reads a local file 'README.rst' for long_description, then calls setup() with static, well-defined package metadata. There is no user input, environment variable processing, dynamic code execution, or external data handling that could introduce security risks. The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides metadata for packaging the 'simplefix' library.",
