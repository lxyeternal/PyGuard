  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, benign utility function for formatting FIX messages.\n- The only notable behavior is replacing byte value 1 with a separator character, which is unusual but benign.\n- No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious activity are detected.\n- The code does not perform network operations, write to external files, or handle sensitive data beyond internal transformation.\n- The import statements are from local modules, consistent with a modular, legitimate package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code in the snippet matches the description: a function `pretty_print` that replaces byte value 1 with a separator character.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only \"anomaly\" noted is the replacement of byte 1 with the separator, which is likely a formatting choice. This is not malicious but could be considered unusual.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: very low (0.1 to 0.2)\n  - Confidence: high (0.9 to 1)\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- The risk scores are very low, which is justified because:\n  - No malicious activity detected.\n  - No suspicious behavior.\n  - The code is a simple formatting utility.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of malicious intent or payloads.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the byte replacement, which is benign.\n- No assumptions are made about external data sources or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores align with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with low-impact formatting utility)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The only unusual behavior (byte 1 replacement) is benign and likely intended for message formatting.\n- No external threats or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility function for FIX message formatting. The reported scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk remains very low, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a very low risk and malware score, and confirm that the code is safe for use.",
