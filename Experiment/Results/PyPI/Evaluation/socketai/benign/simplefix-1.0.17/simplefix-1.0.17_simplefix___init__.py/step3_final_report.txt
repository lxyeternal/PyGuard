  "purpose": "A utility function to pretty-print a raw FIX message buffer by replacing byte value 1 with a separator character.",
  "sources": "The input byte buffer 'buf' provided to the pretty_print function.",
  "sinks": "The function processes data internally; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Byte buffer 'buf' is read, each byte is examined, and byte value 1 is replaced with the separator; the result is returned as bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The replacement of byte value 1 with a separator character is unusual but benign; no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple byte manipulation for formatting purposes. It does not perform network operations, handle sensitive data beyond internal transformation, or include any malicious patterns. The import statements are from local modules, consistent with a legitimate package. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The only anomaly is the replacement of byte 1, which is a benign formatting choice. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the function. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9 to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function for formatting FIX messages. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible. No adjustments are necessary.",
