  "purpose": "Define and organize raw data field tag pairs for FIX protocol message processing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining raw data tag pairs, which are likely used for data processing within the package.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no external input, output, or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code solely establishes data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, contains no functions or executable logic beyond constant definitions, and only defines tuples and lists with fixed values. The comments and structure suggest it is part of a larger system handling FIX messages, specifically raw data fields. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The constants appear to be legitimate protocol tag mappings. The code does not read external input or write to external systems directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines static constants for raw data tag pairs used in FIX message processing. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger financial messaging system.",
