{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for raw data field tags used in FIX protocol message parsing, including their identifiers and related metadata.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only static data definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing occurs in this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing logic; only static tuple and list definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hidden operations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static definitions of tuples and lists mapping FIX protocol data field tags. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. It does not handle any user input, network communication, or sensitive data processing. The comments and licensing are standard. There are no indications of suspicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for a larger FIX message processing system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign configuration module defining data field tags for FIX protocol parsing. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
