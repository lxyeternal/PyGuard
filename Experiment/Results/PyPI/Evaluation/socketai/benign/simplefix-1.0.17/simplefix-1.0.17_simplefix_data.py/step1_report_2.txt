{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of raw data fields and associated tag numbers for use in FIX protocol message parsing or handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures (RAW_DATA, RAW_DATA_TAGS, RAW_LEN_TAGS) defined at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or handle data from external sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply initializes constants; no data flow from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is static data definition only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of tuples representing raw data field pairs, followed by extraction of tag numbers into separate lists. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for a larger FIX message processing system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining static data structures for FIX protocol tags. No malicious intent or security risks are present in this snippet.",
