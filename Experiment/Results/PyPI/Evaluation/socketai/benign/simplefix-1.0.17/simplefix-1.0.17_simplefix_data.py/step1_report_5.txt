  "purpose": "Define raw data fields for FIX protocol messages, including tag pairs for data and length fields.",
  "sources": "Constants defining tuples of tag pairs, with no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output, no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only static data structures are used.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely static data definitions with no malicious or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of tuples representing FIX protocol tag pairs for raw data fields. It includes license and copyright comments but no executable logic, external data input, or sensitive operations. The data is static and hardcoded. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The purpose is to map tag pairs for data fields, likely used elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static data definition module without any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely defines constants for use in other parts of the application.",
