  "purpose": "Define a set of raw data field tag pairs used in FIX protocol message processing for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Constants defining RAW_DATA tuples and RAW_DATA_TAGS, RAW_LEN_TAGS lists.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only defines data structures and constants without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static data definitions do not include execution flow or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static data structures with no dynamic code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only data structure definitions: a tuple of tag pairs (RAW_DATA), and two lists extracting second and first elements from these pairs (RAW_DATA_TAGS, RAW_LEN_TAGS). The purpose appears to be the organization of data field tags for FIX messages. There is no input/output handling, no data processing, no dynamic code, and no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No source-to-sink data flow exists as it is static configuration data. The license is permissive, and no credentials, network connections, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration of data field tags for FIX messages, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It serves as a reference or configuration module within a larger system and does not perform any runtime operations that could pose security risks.",
