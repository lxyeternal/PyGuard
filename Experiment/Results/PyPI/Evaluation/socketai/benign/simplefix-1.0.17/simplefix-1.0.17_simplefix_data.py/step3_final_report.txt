  "purpose": "Static definition of FIX protocol raw data fields and their tag pairs, serving as configuration data for message processing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining tuples of tag pairs; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscation or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static tuples and lists representing FIX protocol tag pairs, with comprehensive comments and licensing. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or network activity. The structure is clear, and the purpose appears to be configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of any suspicious patterns or code execution. All indicators point to a safe, static data module intended for use within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module defining FIX protocol data fields. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
