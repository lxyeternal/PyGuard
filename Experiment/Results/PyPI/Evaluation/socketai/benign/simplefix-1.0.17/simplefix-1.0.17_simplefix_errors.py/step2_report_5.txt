  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes for a FIX message parser.\n- No input/output, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs.\n- The purpose appears to be to support error handling within a larger, legitimate FIX parsing framework.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or malicious.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0, as the code is purely for error handling and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a FIX parser, with no malicious or security-related issues.",
