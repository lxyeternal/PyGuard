{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling various parsing and configuration errors in a FIX message parser, serving as error handling components within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes and their docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code solely declares exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. It contains no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to serve as a set of error types for a FIX parser. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is standard, benign, and purely structural, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for a FIX message parser, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
