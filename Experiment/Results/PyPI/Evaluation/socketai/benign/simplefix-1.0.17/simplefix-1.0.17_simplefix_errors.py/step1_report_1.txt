  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various parsing and configuration errors related to a FIX message parser.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reads occur within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and solely contains class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. It does not include any data processing, input handling, network operations, or external calls. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The purpose appears to be to support a larger parsing framework, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is safe. It only defines exception classes used for error handling in a FIX protocol parser. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
