  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for a FIX protocol parser.\n- They consistently note that the code contains no input/output, no external data handling, no dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- They conclude the code is benign, safe, and standard.\n\n**Code Content Confirmation:**\n- The provided code solely defines exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n- There are no data reads, network operations, or other behaviors.\n- The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python exception class patterns.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clear and limited to error classification.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Scores Given:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence is 1 in all cases, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Risk and Malware Justification:**\n- Since the code only defines exception classes, it cannot perform malicious activities.\n- No malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- The risk score is 0, which aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly do not assume vulnerabilities based on the code alone.\n- They recognize that this code is part of a larger framework but does not itself introduce security risks.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely a set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.\n- It is a standard, safe component of a larger parsing system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is entirely benign and poses no security threat. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The provided scores are accurate.  \n- No further action or adjustment needed.",
