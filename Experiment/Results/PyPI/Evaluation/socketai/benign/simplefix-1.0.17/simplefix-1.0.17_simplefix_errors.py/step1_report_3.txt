{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various parsing and configuration errors related to a FIX protocol parser.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output; only class definitions and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only contains class declarations and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling in a FIX message parser. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external dependencies or network activity. The structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project for parsing FIX protocol messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a financial messaging parser library, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
