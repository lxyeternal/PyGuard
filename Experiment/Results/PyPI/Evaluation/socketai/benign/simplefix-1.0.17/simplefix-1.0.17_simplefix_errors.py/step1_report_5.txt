{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling parsing errors in a FIX protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, storage, or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious logic or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various parsing error exceptions related to FIX message processing. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or data processing. The classes inherit from built-in exceptions and serve as custom error types. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The code appears to be a standard and safe implementation of exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a FIX parser. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
