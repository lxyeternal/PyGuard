  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a FIX protocol parser.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data handling; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, which inherit from built-in Exception classes. There are no data input sources, no data sinks, no dynamic code execution, or external communication. The structure is standard and adheres to normal Python practices for defining custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-defined custom exceptions for a parser, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project focused on FIX protocol message parsing. No malicious or malicious-suspicious behavior detected.",
