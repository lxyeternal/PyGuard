  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to parsing and configuration in a FIX protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of class definitions without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exceptions for parsing errors in a FIX protocol context. It contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. It simply defines exception classes for use elsewhere in the software.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
