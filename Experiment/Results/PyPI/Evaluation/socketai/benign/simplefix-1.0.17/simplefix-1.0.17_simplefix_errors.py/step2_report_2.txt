  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for handling parsing and configuration errors in a FIX message parser.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or external dependencies.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and serve as error types for use elsewhere.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and purely structural.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Malware:**\n   - Given the absence of any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, the code itself poses no security risks.\n   - The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as expected.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with descriptive docstrings, the risk score should be minimal.\n   - The reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification is needed for a higher score.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any malicious potential based on the code's content.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Overall Evaluation & Final Estimate:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.\n   - The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware.\n   - The risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The malware score should stay at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The overall security risk score should be **0**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a FIX parser, with no malicious or security concern. The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
