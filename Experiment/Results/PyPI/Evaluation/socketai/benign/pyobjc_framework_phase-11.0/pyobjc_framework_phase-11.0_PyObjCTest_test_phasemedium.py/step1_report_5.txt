{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for the PHASE module, specifically testing constants and enumeration types related to PHASEMediumPreset.",
  "sources": "The code imports a testing utility from PyObjCTools and the PHASE module; it reads no external input data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output untrusted data; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs assertions on constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses standard testing patterns, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case verifying enumeration types and specific constant values in the PHASE module. It imports necessary testing tools and a module likely related to some media or processing functionality. No suspicious code behavior, no data leaks, no external network activity, or code execution flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test case verifying constants and enum types in the PHASE module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
