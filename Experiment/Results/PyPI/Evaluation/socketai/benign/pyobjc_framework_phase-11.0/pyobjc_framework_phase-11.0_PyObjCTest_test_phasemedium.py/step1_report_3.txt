  "purpose": "Test class for verifying constants in the PHASE module related to medium presets.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and PHASE module.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that check enum types and constant values; no data sinks or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> running assertions to verify constants; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fourcc function for encoding string to four-character code; no signs of malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the PHASE module, then defines a test case that checks enum types and specific constant values. The fourcc function encodes a string 'mdAr' to a four-character code, a common pattern in multimedia programming. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The assertions serve to validate expected constants, indicating standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward unit test verifying constants within the PHASE module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
