  "purpose": "Verify method argument attributes in the PHASE.PHASEAssetRegistry class to ensure correct signature annotations, primarily for Objective-C to Python bridging.",
  "sources": "Method signatures within the PHASE.PHASEAssetRegistry class, specifically argument annotations such as 'out' parameters and callback blocks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, network or file operations, or data processing present; thus, no sinks related to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code inspects method signatures and argument attributes without executing data flows or processing untrusted input; no runtime data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward unit test for method signature validation, with clear structure and no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests asserting argument attributes for methods in the PHASE.PHASEAssetRegistry class. It does not process external data, perform network or file operations, or execute dynamic code. The assertions confirm method signatures, which is standard for interface validation in Objective-C bindings. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, purely structural nature of the code. High confidence is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying method signature attributes, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are appropriate and indicate a safe, non-malicious dependency.",
