  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'PHASE' framework wrappers for macOS using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "Reading the __doc__ string, importing os, sys, and pyobjc_setup.setup, and accessing the __file__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code reads metadata and environment information to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path, defines package version, and calls setup with package metadata and dependencies. It appears to be a conventional package setup script with no suspicious or malicious activity. No external inputs or untrusted data processing are present; the code solely defines package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python framework wrapper. It does not contain malware or security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
