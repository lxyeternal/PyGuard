  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the script as a package setup for the PHASE framework wrapper, with sources limited to standard modules and file path info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed; code appears standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the script is straightforward, with no suspicious code or data flows.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also confirms the script's standard nature, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard package setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of malware:** No. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None identified; the script is a standard setup configuration.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero, as there is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score justification:** Zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score justification:** Zero, standard package setup poses no security threat.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the consistent analysis and the nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. All reports are aligned with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If any future reports suggest dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious data handling, reassessment would be necessary.",
