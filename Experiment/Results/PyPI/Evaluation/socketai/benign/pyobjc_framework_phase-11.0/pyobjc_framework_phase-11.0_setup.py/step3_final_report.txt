{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-PHASE' framework on macOS, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Standard modules ('os', 'sys'), file path information, and static package metadata within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, modifying sys.path, defining version info, and calling setup() with package details. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical packaging practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
