{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyobjc-framework-PHASE package, providing macOS framework wrappers",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys, pyobjc_setup), os.path.dirname(__file__), and __doc__",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup, modifies sys.path, and defines package metadata. It imports standard modules and a setup function from pyobjc_setup. The use of os.path.dirname(__file__) and __doc__ for description is typical. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code follows standard packaging practices without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package providing macOS framework wrappers. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
