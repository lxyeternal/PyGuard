{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure Python bindings for the macOS PHASE framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), sys.path, and imported setup from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports and configuration data flow from environment and file system to the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup for the pyobjc-framework-PHASE, inserting the current directory into sys.path, importing the setup function, and invoking it with package details and dependencies. All operations are standard for a Python package configuration script. No indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are evident. The dependencies are versioned but benign, and there are no external network calls, credential handling, or system manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It is a straightforward package configuration file with no suspicious activities.",
