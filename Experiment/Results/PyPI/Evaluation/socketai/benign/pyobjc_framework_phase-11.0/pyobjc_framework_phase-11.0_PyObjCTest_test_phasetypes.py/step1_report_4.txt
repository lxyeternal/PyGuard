{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying constants, enums, and definitions in the PHASE module, primarily to ensure correct values and types.",
  "sources": "import statement for PHASE module; usage of fourcc function and constants from PHASE",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leaks, or sensitive data processing detected",
  "flows": "Import of PHASE module and use of fourcc to define constants and verify their values",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; usage of fourcc is standard for four-character codes; no hardcoded secrets or external data sources",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, enum and constant value assertions, and verification of module attributes. It uses a function 'fourcc' to generate constants with four-character codes, which is typical for media or binary formats. The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute untrusted code. All constants are static and intended for testing purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code appears to be straightforward unit tests to confirm the integrity of constants in the PHASE module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite verifying constants and enum types within the PHASE module. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign and conventional piece of test code.",
