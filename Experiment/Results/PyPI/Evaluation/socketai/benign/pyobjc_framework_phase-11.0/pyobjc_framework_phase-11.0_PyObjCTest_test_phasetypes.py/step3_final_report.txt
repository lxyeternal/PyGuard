{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying constants and enum types in the PHASE module, ensuring they match expected values and formats.",
  "sources": "Static assertions on constants and enum values; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static validation without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assertions with standard usage of fourcc codes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static checks on constants and enum types, with no dynamic behavior, external data, or code execution. It uses fourcc to define four-character codes, which is standard in multimedia contexts. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The code is typical for validation of static definitions, and all signals point to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test verifying constants and enum types within the PHASE module. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
