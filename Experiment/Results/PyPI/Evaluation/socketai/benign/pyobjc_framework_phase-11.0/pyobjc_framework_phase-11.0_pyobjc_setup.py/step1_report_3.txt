  "purpose": "This script facilitates the setup and build process for the PyObjC framework wrappers, including custom build commands, version retrieval, SDK handling, and test suite management.",
  "sources": "System commands (`subprocess.check_output`), environment variables (`os.environ`), file system operations (`os.path`, `os.listdir`, open/read/write), and user-provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands (`subprocess.check_output`, `subprocess.Popen`), file reads/writes (particularly plist and header files), modifications to `sys.path`, and import statements for test modules.",
  "flows": "System commands (e.g., `sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`) provide system info; environment variables influence SDK and compiler detection; file reads for configuration and SDK info; modifications to `sys.path` and import of test modules; build commands invoke external compilers and copy header files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `subprocess` to invoke system utilities like `sw_vers`, `clang`, and `xcrun` could be misused if manipulated. The code dynamically modifies `sys.path` and imports modules based on runtime findings. There are no obvious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python extension package, including system info retrieval, SDK handling, build customization, and testing. It uses system commands to determine OS and SDK versions, manipulates `sys.path` for testing, and invokes external compilers. The `subprocess` calls are for environment detection, not for executing arbitrary code. File operations focus on configuration files, header files, and documentation URLs. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The code's behavior aligns with its intended purpose: build automation and testing facilitation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard build and setup script for a Python extension package, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It relies on system commands and file operations typical for such tasks. While it interacts with system utilities, these are used for configuration and environment detection, not for harmful actions.",
