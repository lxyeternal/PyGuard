{
  "purpose": "This script provides setup and build configuration for the PyObjC framework, including custom commands, build processes, and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Inputs from environment variables, subprocess outputs, and file reads (e.g., SDK settings, plist files).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocesses (e.g., 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), file writes (build info, headers), and dynamic import of test modules.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence SDK detection, compiler setup, and build options. Files read for SDK info and plist data influence build configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of subprocess for system info collection is standard but could be misused if misconfigured; however, no malicious intent is evident. The code performs environment queries and file manipulations for build setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles build setup, environment detection, and test management for a Python C-extension package. It includes functions to determine SDK versions, configure compilers, and integrate tests. Use of subprocess for system info is typical for build scripts. No indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns identified. All subprocess calls and file reads are consistent with build environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script for PyObjC with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs environment detection, build customization, and test execution with standard techniques. No malware signals or security risks are present.",
