{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup and build script for the PyObjC framework, managing environment detection, configuration, testing, and packaging.",
  "sources": "Uses subprocess to invoke system utilities (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads SDK plist files, and loads package metadata files.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands for environment info; reads and writes files; modifies sys.path; loads modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via subprocess influences build configuration; file reads inform SDK versions; dynamic imports load test modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; subprocess calls are standard for environment detection; no external data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment detection, SDK versioning, and test orchestration typical for build systems. It uses subprocess to gather system info, reads configuration files, and manipulates sys.path for testing. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are for legitimate environment detection, and no network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code is transparent and adheres to standard build practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build and setup script for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
