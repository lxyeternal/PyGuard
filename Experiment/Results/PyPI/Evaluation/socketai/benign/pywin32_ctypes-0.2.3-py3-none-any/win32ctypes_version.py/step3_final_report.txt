  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is straightforward with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a static version string to __version__, with no input/output, data flow, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence score is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
