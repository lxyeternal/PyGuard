  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for Windows DLL management (`LoadLibraryExW` and `FreeLibrary`) using a factory pattern with validation.",
  "sources": "Calls to `dlls.kernel32.LoadLibraryExW` and `dlls.kernel32.FreeLibrary` with parameters supplied externally (DLL path, handle, flags).",
  "sinks": "The DLL path and handle parameters, which if supplied maliciously, could lead to loading malicious DLLs or resource mismanagement.",
  "flows": "External input (DLL path, handle, flags) -> validation functions -> system DLL functions (`LoadLibraryExW`, `FreeLibrary`) -> potential resource management or malicious DLL loading if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API wrappers with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines minimal wrappers around Windows DLL functions, with validation functions to check for null or false returns. It does not process untrusted data directly but could be misused if external code supplies malicious DLL paths. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions are standard and legitimate for DLL management. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting typical risks associated with DLL loading functions if misused externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign wrapper for Windows DLL functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The potential security concern exists only if external code supplies malicious DLL paths, but this is a common pattern and not indicative of malicious activity within this code snippet.",
