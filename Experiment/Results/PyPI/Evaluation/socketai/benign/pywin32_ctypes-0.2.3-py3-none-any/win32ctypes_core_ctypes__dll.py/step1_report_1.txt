{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper for Windows DLL loading and unloading functions using ctypes.",
  "sources": "Import of DLL functions from kernel32.dll via function_factory, which are then used to load and free libraries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; functions interact with system DLLs for library management.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; only system calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward system API wrapper without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific Windows types and utility functions, then creates wrappers around kernel32 DLL functions LoadLibraryExW and FreeLibrary. These wrappers are generated using a factory function, likely to standardize error checking (e.g., check_null, check_false). The code is part of a larger module, likely for dynamic library management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is minimal, focused on system API interaction, and does not process user input or untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard system API wrapper for DLL management with no suspicious or malicious elements. It appears to be legitimate system utility code.",
