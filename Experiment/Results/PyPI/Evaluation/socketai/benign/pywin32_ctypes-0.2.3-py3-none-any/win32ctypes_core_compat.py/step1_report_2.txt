  "flows": "None; simple type checks without data flow or manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three straightforward type-checking functions using isinstance(). There are no external data inputs, no data outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The functions serve as helpers for type validation and do not contain any malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simple utility functions for type checking with no malicious intent or security risks.",
