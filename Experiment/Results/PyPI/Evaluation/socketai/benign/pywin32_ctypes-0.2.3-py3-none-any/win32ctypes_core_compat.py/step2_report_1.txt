  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n- The original code consists of three simple functions:\n  ```python\n  def is_bytes(b):\n      return isinstance(b, bytes)\n\n  def is_text(s):\n      return isinstance(s, str)\n\n  def is_integer(i):\n      return isinstance(i, int)\n  ```\n- These functions perform straightforward type checks without any input/output handling, external data, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n- The code is minimal and direct. No errors, flaws, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or external dependencies are present.\n- The functions serve as utility helpers, which are common and benign.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n- All five reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- They emphasize the lack of data flows, external data, or suspicious constructs.\n- They assign maximum confidence (1) and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, and none are justified.\n- The code is simple, and the reports correctly identify it as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n- The scores align well with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward utility functions with no security concerns.",
