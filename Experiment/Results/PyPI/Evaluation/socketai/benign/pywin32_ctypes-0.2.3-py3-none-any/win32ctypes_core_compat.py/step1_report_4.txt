  "purpose": "Provide simple type-checking utility functions for bytes, text, and integer types.",
  "sources": "None; the functions do not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions do not write or process data in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple type checkers, using isinstance to verify data types. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard utility functions without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as basic type validation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
