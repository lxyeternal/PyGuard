  "purpose": "Utility functions to check data types (bytes, text, integer).",
  "sources": "Function calls that provide input data to be checked.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to the type-checking functions and returned as boolean values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple type-checking functions that verify whether input variables are of specific data types. The functions use Python's isinstance() for checks and return boolean results. No external inputs, environment variable usage, or data manipulation occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic type verification safely.",
