  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists of simple, straightforward utility functions performing type checks.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n**Confirmations and evaluations:**\n- The code snippets are exactly as provided, with no hidden behavior or modifications.\n- The reports correctly identify that these functions are safe and serve as helpers within a larger codebase.\n- No report suggests any reason to suspect malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate; no changes are necessary.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I would agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments are needed.",
