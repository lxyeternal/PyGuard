{
  "purpose": "The functions are utility checks for verifying the data type of variables, specifically for bytes, text, and integers.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with simple type-check functions; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three small, isolated functions that perform basic type checking using isinstance. There are no input handling, no external data reads, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to serve as utility functions within a larger codebase. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from these functions alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard type checks without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation or malware, and the security risk is negligible.",
