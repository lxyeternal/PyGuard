  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking of bytes, text, and integers in Python.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to each function (b, s, i) passed directly as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; functions return boolean results based on type checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into isinstance() checks, returning boolean outputs; no data leaks or external flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions are straightforward, simple type checks with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three simple functions performing direct type checks using isinstance(). There are no external data reads, no side effects, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The functions are utility helpers, common in Python codebases. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence (1). The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and serves as utility functions for type verification. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
