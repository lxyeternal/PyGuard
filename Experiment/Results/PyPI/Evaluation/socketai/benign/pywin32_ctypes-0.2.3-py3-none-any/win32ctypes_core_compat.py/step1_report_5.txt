  "purpose": "Utility functions to check data types (bytes, text, integer)",
  "sources": "No data input sources; functions operate on parameters provided during calls",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; functions return boolean values based on input type",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing; simple type checks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines three straightforward functions for type checking. Each function verifies whether the input belongs to a specific data type: bytes, str, or int. There are no external data sources, network operations, file I/O, or any side effects. The functions are simple and perform no malicious actions or complex logic. No evidence of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs basic type checks without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be utility code with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
