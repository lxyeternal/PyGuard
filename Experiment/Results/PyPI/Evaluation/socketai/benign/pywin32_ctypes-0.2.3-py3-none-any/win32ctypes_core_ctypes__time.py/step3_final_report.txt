  "purpose": "Wrapper around Windows API GetTickCount to retrieve system uptime in milliseconds.",
  "sources": "dlls.kernel32.GetTickCount via function_factory",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Call to system API through wrapper function",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward API wrapper with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports Windows API types and modules, then creates a wrapper function for GetTickCount using function_factory. It does not process user input, handle data leaks, or perform network activity. The implementation is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Scores assigned by reports (malware=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature. No logical errors or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for a Windows system call with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect its safety, and scores are justified.",
