  "purpose": "Define a function to retrieve system tick count using Windows API",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes.wintypes and local utility modules, specifically the DLL function for GetTickCount",
  "sinks": "Calls to the Windows API kernel32.GetTickCount through a dynamically created function",
  "flows": "External DLL function (kernel32.GetTickCount) is wrapped and assigned to _GetTickCount for later use",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard Windows API usage, no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function factory call to wrap the Windows API GetTickCount. This function is used to retrieve system uptime or tick count, which is common in system monitoring or performance measurement. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears straightforward and legitimate, relying on standard system libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical system API wrapper to obtain the system tick count. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
