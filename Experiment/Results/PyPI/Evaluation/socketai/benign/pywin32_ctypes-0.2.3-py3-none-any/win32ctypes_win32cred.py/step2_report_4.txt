  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: an import statement with a deprecation warning.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The primary concerns are the use of wildcard import (*) and the deprecated import path.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code only performs an import and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The import uses a wildcard, which can obscure namespace clarity, but this is a known issue, not a security concern per se.\n- The deprecation warning indicates outdated usage but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Errors or flaws in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any actual vulnerability or malicious behavior, which is accurate.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable, given the context.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2) due to the use of deprecated import style and wildcard import, which are maintainability concerns but not security risks.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are reasonable.\n- The main point is that this code snippet is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** ~0.1 (reflecting maintainability concerns but no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The primary concerns are maintainability and modernization of import statements, not security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\nIf I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would agree with the existing scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity, just outdated coding practices.",
