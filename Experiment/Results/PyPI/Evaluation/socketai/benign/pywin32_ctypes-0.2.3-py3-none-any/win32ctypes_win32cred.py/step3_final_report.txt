  "purpose": "Import the win32cred module from win32ctypes.pywin32 for Windows credential management, issuing a deprecation warning about the import path.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from win32ctypes.pywin32.win32cred import *' triggers the warning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks or untrusted data flows; it only performs an import and issues a warning.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import operation and the warning issuance; no data or control flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) and the deprecated import path are maintainability concerns but not security anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a Windows credential management module and issues a deprecation warning. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. The wildcard import reduces clarity but is not malicious. The deprecation warning indicates outdated usage but not security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to maintainability concerns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The main issues are maintainability and modernization of the import statement. Scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
