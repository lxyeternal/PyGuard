  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimal import statement with an accompanying deprecation warning.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`*`), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.\n- The deprecation warning indicates the import path is outdated, but this is a maintenance concern, not a security issue.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the import and potential system interaction.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor, considering the import of system functions could be misused if called improperly, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on the deprecation warning and the wildcard import.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is just a warning and import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scoring seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, emphasizing the deprecation warning and import.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk from this code.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the straightforward import with a deprecation warning.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor, consistent with previous reports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Notes potential system interaction via imported functions but correctly states that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to potential misuse if functions are called improperly, but the code snippet itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is acceptable given the potential for misuse if functions are called later, but the code snippet itself is harmless.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code provided.\n- The use of wildcard import and deprecated import path are maintenance concerns but do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the potential for misuse if functions are invoked improperly later.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
