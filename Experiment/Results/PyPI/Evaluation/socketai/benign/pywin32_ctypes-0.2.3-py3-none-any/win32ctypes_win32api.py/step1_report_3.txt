  "purpose": "To import the win32api module from the win32ctypes.pywin32 package, with a deprecation warning for future import practices.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'win32ctypes.pywin32.win32api' module during import.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leakage points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; the flow is straightforward module import, with a warning issued afterward.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a deprecated import path and issues a deprecation warning, but there are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module from a third-party package, issuing a deprecation warning to guide future import practices. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. The use of 'warnings.warn' is standard for deprecation notices. The import itself is from a legitimate library, and no malicious code is embedded or executed. The code's structure is minimal and standard, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple, legitimate import statement with a deprecation warning, showing no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
