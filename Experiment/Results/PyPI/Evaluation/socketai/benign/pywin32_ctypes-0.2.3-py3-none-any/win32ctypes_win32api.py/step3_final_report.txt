  "purpose": "Minimal import of Windows API functions with a deprecation warning, likely for system interaction or legacy support.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'win32ctypes.pywin32.win32api'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code only performs import and warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') and deprecated import path; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Windows API functions using a wildcard, which is discouraged but not malicious. It issues a deprecation warning indicating outdated import practices. No data processing, network activity, or system modifications are present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The import is from a legitimate library, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional import statement with no malicious intent. The minor concerns relate to coding practices rather than security threats.",
