  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .version import __version__`.\n   - The original code is a standard practice for version management in Python packages.\n   - No input handling, no external data flows, no network activity.\n   - The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1.0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no threat.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code is a simple import statement; no malicious payloads are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign with no security concerns. The code is a minimal, standard import statement for versioning, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and typical in open source Python packages.",
