  "purpose": "Importing version information from a local module to provide package version details.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; static import statement only.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads static data from local version module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a version string from a local module named 'version'. This is standard practice for defining package versioning and does not involve any user input, environment variables, or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The file appears to be a small, straightforward part of a larger package setup, with proper licensing comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves to expose the package version, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
