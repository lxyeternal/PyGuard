  "purpose": "Import the __version__ string from a local module for version management in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .version import __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import with no data flow",
  "flows": "N/A - static import without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice for exposing package version information. It performs a static import from a local module, with no input handling, network activity, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The confidence score of 1.0 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version import statement with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
