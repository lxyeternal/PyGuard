  "purpose": "Importing version information from a local module for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading from the relative module '.version' to get __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static import statement.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads __version__ from local module, no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of copyright and license comments, but no suspicious or unusual code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single import statement importing __version__ from a local module. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs beyond the import. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or risky behavior are present. The code adheres to typical package versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to expose the package version. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
