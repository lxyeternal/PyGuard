  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is a simple import statement for a version string from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward and standard practice in Python packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no input handling, data flow, or network activity. No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as the code is not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, the code is a benign import statement with no security implications.  \n- The reports uniformly assign maximum confidence (1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince the code is purely a benign import statement with no data flow from untrusted sources, no malicious payloads, and no obfuscation, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nThe malware score of 0 is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, instead focusing on what the code actually does. The assessments are accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign import statement for version information, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No changes needed.",
