  "analysis": "The code imports a version string or number from a local module named version, which is common in Python packages for version tracking. There are no input/output operations, no code execution, and no security-sensitive actions. The file contains only licensing comments and a simple import statement. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard package initialization snippet intended to include version information. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
