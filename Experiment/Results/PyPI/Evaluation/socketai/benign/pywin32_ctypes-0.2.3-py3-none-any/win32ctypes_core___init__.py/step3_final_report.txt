  "purpose": "Implements dynamic module redirection based on runtime detection of 'cffi' to support multiple backends ('ctypes' or 'cffi') for specific modules.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'cffi' import; defines custom MetaPathFinder and Loader; appends finder to sys.meta_path.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module calls, importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec creation, sys.meta_path manipulation.",
  "flows": "Detection of 'cffi' presence -> setting backend -> sys.meta_path includes custom finder -> import of specific modules triggers find_spec -> redirection to backend-specific modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python import machinery to redirect module imports based on runtime environment. It detects 'cffi' availability and redirects certain modules to backend-specific implementations, which is a common pattern for supporting multiple backends. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The import redirection mechanism, while advanced, is legitimate and widely used in plugin or backend abstraction systems. The scores assigned in the provided reports are consistent with the code's benign and transparent nature. The primary potential risk lies in the trustworthiness of redirected modules, not in the redirection code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of backend-specific module redirection. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The use of import hooks introduces some complexity but does not constitute a security threat in this context. The overall security posture is benign, with a minimal risk score (~0.2) reflecting the potential attack surface if redirected modules are compromised.",
