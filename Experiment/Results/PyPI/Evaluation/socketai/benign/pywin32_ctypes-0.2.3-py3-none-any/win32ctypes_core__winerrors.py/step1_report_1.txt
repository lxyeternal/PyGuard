  "purpose": "Define a constant error code for 'not found' condition",
  "sources": "The assignment of the constant ERROR_NOT_FOUND",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external data usage",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a constant definition",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code logic, functions, or external interactions; only a constant definition and comments",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple constant assignment with licensing comments. No input sources, data flows, or external interactions are present. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The comments are standard licensing information, and the constant appears to be a part of a larger codebase but is harmless by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign constant definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It contains only licensing comments and a single constant assignment, with no suspicious or anomalous features.",
