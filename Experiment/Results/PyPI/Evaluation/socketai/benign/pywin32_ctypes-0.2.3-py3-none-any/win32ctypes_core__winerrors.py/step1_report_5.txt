{
  "purpose": "Define a constant for an error code, likely used in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The line assigning a value to ERROR_NOT_FOUND.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright notice, license information, and a single constant definition. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The constant appears to represent an error code, possibly for 'not found' scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining an error code constant with no malicious intent or security risks.",
