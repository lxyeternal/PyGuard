{
  "purpose": "This code defines a constant ERROR_NOT_FOUND with a hexadecimal value, likely used as an error code in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static constant assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only a constant declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple constant assignment with licensing comments, with no input sources, data flows, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All previous reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
