  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple constant assignment: `ERROR_NOT_FOUND = 0x490`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is only a constant declaration, with licensing comments.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - No reports indicate any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n3. **Security Risks:**\n   - Since it's a simple constant definition with no data processing, no input/output, and no external interactions, the security risk is negligible.\n   - All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n4. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are uniform and agree on the benign nature, there are no conflicting scores or assessments.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be defining an error code constant, which is typical in many codebases.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward constant assignment with licensing comments.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n- The code snippet is safe and standard; it should be considered low risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
