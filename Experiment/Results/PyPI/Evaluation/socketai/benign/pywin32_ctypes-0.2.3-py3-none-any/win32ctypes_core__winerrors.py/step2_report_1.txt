  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple constant assignment: `ERROR_NOT_FOUND = 0x490`.  \n- The original code provided matches this description exactly, with no additional logic, functions, or data flows.  \n- There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The code is purely a constant declaration, likely part of a larger codebase.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports accurately describe the code. The issues are not present; it's a benign constant definition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n- The reports are consistent in stating the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- They correctly identify the absence of data flows, input sources, or sinks.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.  \n- The conclusions that the code is harmless and standard are justified.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the analysis. The code is simple, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the confidence is high.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports assign a malware score of 0, and the code is a straightforward constant, there's no reason to increase the risk score.  \n- The security risk is also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All claims are based on observable facts: the code is a constant assignment with licensing comments.  \n- No assumptions are made about hidden behavior or malicious intent; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the description: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- The high confidence is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward constant definition with no suspicious features, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and benign.",
