  "purpose": "The code provides an import statement for win32ctypes.pywin32.pywintypes with a deprecation warning to encourage use of an updated import path.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from win32ctypes.pywin32.pywintypes import *'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs an import with a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import (*) is generally discouraged but not malicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module, issuing a deprecation warning suggesting an alternative import path. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external network communications. The presence of a deprecation warning indicates maintenance but does not suggest malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, serving a single purpose of informing users about an updated import method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deprecation notice with an import statement. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.",
