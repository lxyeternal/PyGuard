  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a simple import statement with a deprecation warning.\n- No data flows, no external communication, no processing of untrusted data.\n- The use of wildcard import (*) is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with minor style concerns.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning for import path.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external sinks, straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, focusing on backward compatibility.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, only a warning and import.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a style concern (wildcard import).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The minor securityRisk is justified due to the wildcard import, which can cause namespace pollution, but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, style issue (wildcard import).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, just a warning and import.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The only minor concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security problem.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected in any report.\n- The deprecation warning indicates maintenance, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, should be **close to 0**, perhaps **0.1** at most, mainly due to style concerns (wildcard import). The current scores of 0.1 are acceptable but could be lowered to 0 if desired.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (due to wildcard import style concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, benign deprecation warning with an import statement. No security risks or malware are present. The scores assigned are reasonable, but I would suggest slightly lowering the securityRisk to 0 unless style concerns are to be emphasized separately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and serves a maintenance purpose.",
