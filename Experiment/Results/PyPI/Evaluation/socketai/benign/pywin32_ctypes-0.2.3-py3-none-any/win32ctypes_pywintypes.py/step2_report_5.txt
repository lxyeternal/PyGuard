  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: an import statement with a deprecation warning.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external communication, or complex logic.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Behavior:\n- **Code correctness:** The import statement is syntactically correct. It performs a module import, and the warning is issued at runtime.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports indicate or suggest malicious behavior. The code is purely for deprecation notification.\n- **Data flow:** No data inputs, outputs, or external interactions are involved.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import (`*`) is a style concern but not a security threat.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports give a low score (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk mainly due to style issues (wildcard import). This is reasonable.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign `securityRisk` around 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.  \n  The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is transparent.  \n  The security risk score of 0.1 is slightly elevated due to the wildcard import, but since it’s a benign deprecation notice, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign deprecation warning with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The main concern is style (wildcard import), which does not elevate risk significantly.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to style concerns, not security)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is a simple, benign deprecation warning with an import statement.\n- No malicious or obfuscated activity is present.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code poses no security threat. The minor style issue (wildcard import) is noted but not a security concern. The overall risk remains very low.",
