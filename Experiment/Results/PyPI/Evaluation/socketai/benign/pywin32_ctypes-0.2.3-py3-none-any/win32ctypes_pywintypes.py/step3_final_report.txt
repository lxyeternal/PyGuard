  "purpose": "A simple import statement with a deprecation warning indicating a change in module usage.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from win32ctypes.pywin32.pywintypes import *` and the runtime warning.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; purely an import and warning.",
  "flows": "Import statement executes, issuing a warning; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`*`) is a style concern but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import with a deprecation warning, serving as a notification for users to update their import path. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The wildcard import is discouraged but not security-related. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1) due to style concerns. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice with no malicious or security issues. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent. The only minor improvement would be replacing the wildcard import with explicit imports for style, but this does not impact security.",
