  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Python SDK's span sending functionality and proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external data effects are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; tests invoke methods with hardcoded, controlled values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; usage of mocks and standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite using unittest framework, mocking external dependencies. It tests the 'send_span' method with controlled, hardcoded data, and does not process user input, environment variables, or external data sources. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or suspicious behavior are present. No external connections or data leaks are evident. The code structure is standard for unit tests, with no anomalies or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe test suite with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs controlled unit testing without external data influence or harmful actions.",
