{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the Wavefront Python SDK's span sending functionality, including span logs handling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded UUIDs, string literals, and function parameters such as span name, timestamp, trace IDs, parent IDs, tags, and span logs.",
  "sinks": "Mocked send_data method in WavefrontProxyClient's proxy connection handler, which outputs formatted data strings.",
  "flows": "Test functions call send_span with specific parameters, which then format and pass data to the mocked send_data method; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Use of mocks indicates test setup, not production code; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that mocks network interactions to test span data formatting and sending. No data leaks, malicious code, or security issues are evident. The test inputs are static, and the output is simulated via mocks. No external inputs, no sensitive data handling, and no potentially malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite designed to verify the formatting and sending of span data within the Wavefront SDK. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
