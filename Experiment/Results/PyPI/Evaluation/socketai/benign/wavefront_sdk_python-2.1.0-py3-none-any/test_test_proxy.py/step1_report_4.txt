  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Python SDK to verify span sending functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from wavefront_sdk modules, test data inputs such as UUIDs and span logs, mock objects.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; test code primarily uses mock objects.",
  "flows": "Test methods create span data and call send_data on mocked ProxyConnectionHandler; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; tests and mocks appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test module that mocks internal components of the Wavefront SDK to test span data transmission functions. No evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, uses standard testing practices, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test module intended to validate SDK functionality. No malware or security risks detected.",
