{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ApplicationTags class in the Wavefront SDK to verify correct behavior of adding custom tags from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via patch.dict (os.environ), used in add_custom_tags_from_env and add_custom_tag_from_env methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data output occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during the add_custom_tags_from_env and add_custom_tag_from_env methods to augment the custom_tags list.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates environment variables dynamically for tag augmentation, but it uses standard, safe Python functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test setup for a Python class. It patches environment variables to simulate different conditions, then tests methods that add tags based on environment variables. No malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment variable usage is safe within the test context. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe unit testing of environment-based tag addition in a Python SDK component. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
