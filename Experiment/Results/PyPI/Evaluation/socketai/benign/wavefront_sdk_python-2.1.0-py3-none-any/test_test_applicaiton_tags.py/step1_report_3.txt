  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Application Tags functionality, specifically adding custom tags from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via 'os.environ' (mocked in tests).",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; tests involve internal method calls and environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and processed to add custom tags; no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of regex in add_custom_tags_from_env is safe but should be checked for correctness; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for application tag management, mocking environment variables for testing. It verifies the addition of custom tags from environment variables based on pattern matching. No data leaks, external network connections, or malicious code are present. The tests use standard Python unittest features and mocking; no suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit test code for application tag management with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It solely tests internal functionality and environment variable handling.",
