  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Application Tags management, including environment-based tag addition.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables) via patch in setUp method.",
  "sinks": "None directly—no data is being sent over the network, written to files, or used in system calls.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during tests to add tags; no untrusted data flows to system or external interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Tests are straightforward. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for a class managing application tags. It mocks environment variables to simulate different scenarios. No code injection, data exfiltration, or network communication occurs. Usage of 'patch.dict' ensures controlled environment variable testing without external data leaks or malicious input handling. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It tests environment variable handling for application tags safely and predictably.",
