  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront SDK Metrics Registry functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly user-defined modules like wavefront_sdk and wavefront_sdk.common.metrics.registry, and mock client class definition.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file I/O occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "Test functions create metric objects, invoke methods that modify internal counters, and verify expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns observed. Use of a mock client class that does not perform network operations is typical for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests for a metrics registry, involving creation and manipulation of gauges, counters, and delta counters. It imports standard and third-party modules safely, with no evidence of malicious logic. The mock client class is benign, used solely for testing purposes. No untrusted input handling, network communication, or suspicious operations detected. The code structure is typical for test suites, with no suspicious code paths or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for the Wavefront SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard testing practices and mock objects for safe testing.",
