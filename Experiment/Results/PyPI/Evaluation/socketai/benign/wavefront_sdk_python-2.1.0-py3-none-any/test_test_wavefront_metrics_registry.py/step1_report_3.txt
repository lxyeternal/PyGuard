  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront SDK Metrics Registry functions and classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data from internal variables and method calls; no external untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data used is internal or mock data within test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard testing frameworks and imports. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit tests verifying the behavior of metrics registry classes. It uses mock objects and internal state checks without external data or network operations. No suspicious logic, no data exfiltration, nor malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite for the metrics SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
