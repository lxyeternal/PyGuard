{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Client functionalities, including server info extraction and client management.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded URL strings within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data processing observed in the code.",
  "flows": "Test URLs are used as inputs to methods, no untrusted or external data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets beyond test data, or unusual code patterns. The test URLs contain embedded tokens, but these are static test values, not secret credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of standard unit tests verifying client factory behavior, URL parsing, and client retrieval. No network activity or data collection occurs during tests. Hardcoded test tokens and URLs are typical for testing and do not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling is present. The code does not interact with untrusted inputs or external sources during execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests with hardcoded test data, serving to verify client factory behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security risks within this module. The embedded tokens are test data and do not pose security threats.",
