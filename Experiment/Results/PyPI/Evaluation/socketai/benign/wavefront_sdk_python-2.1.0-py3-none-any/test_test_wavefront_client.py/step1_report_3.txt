  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront SDK client factory functions and client retrieval mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Input URLs and configuration parameters for client creation and retrieval, such as server URLs, tokens, OAuth credentials, and API tokens.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data is being written or transmitted directly by this code.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and credentials are used internally for client instantiation and validation; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code mainly performs standard unit testing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit test cases for a client factory class, testing URL parsing, client creation, and existence checks. It processes input URLs and credentials but does not execute or embed any malicious actions, network communications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets appear malicious, and the flow is straightforward. No anomalies suggest malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for client factory methods with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It performs expected validation routines without harmful or suspicious actions.",
