{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for Wavefront Client functionality, including server info retrieval and client management.",
  "sources": "Reads from hardcoded URL strings, environment variables are not explicitly used, and no external inputs are directly processed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that process untrusted input; primarily assertions on static strings and method returns.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; test inputs are hardcoded URLs, and outputs are object types or fixed values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets are limited to test values, no code injection or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a client factory, validating URL parsing and client object types. No external inputs or environment variables are read at runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The test inputs are static and only used to verify functionality. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for the Wavefront SDK without any malicious intent or security risks. It only interacts with static test data and performs standard assertions. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
