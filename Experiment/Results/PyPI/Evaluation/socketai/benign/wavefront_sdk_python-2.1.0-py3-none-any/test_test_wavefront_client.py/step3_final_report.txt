  "purpose": "Unit tests for Wavefront SDK client factory, verifying URL parsing, client creation, and management functions with static test data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URLs, tokens, and credentials within test functions",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Test data used directly in function calls and assertions; no external data flow or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and solely for testing purposes",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests with static test URLs and tokens, used solely for validation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The embedded tokens are dummy data, not secrets. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The test functions perform assertions on in-memory data, with no external dependencies or inputs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's nature and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The static test data do not pose a security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the code's safety. No further action or modification is necessary.",
