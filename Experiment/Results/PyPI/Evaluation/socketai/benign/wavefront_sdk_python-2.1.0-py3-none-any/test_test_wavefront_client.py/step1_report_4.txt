  "purpose": "Unit tests for Wavefront SDK client factory functions to verify server info retrieval, client creation, and existing client checks.",
  "sources": "Input URLs and strings within test methods, such as server URLs, tokens, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process or execute untrusted data beyond test input validation.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and tokens flow through method calls to create or retrieve clients; no data is sent externally or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard test code with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets aside from test data.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing on the Wavefront SDK client factory, verifying server info extraction and client retrieval. All inputs are static test strings, and there is no indication of dynamic or malicious data processing. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard unittest practices and imports only from known SDK modules. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The test data are mock values typical for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing suite for a client factory module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code simply validates expected behaviors with static test inputs, and there are no signs of malware or security threats.",
