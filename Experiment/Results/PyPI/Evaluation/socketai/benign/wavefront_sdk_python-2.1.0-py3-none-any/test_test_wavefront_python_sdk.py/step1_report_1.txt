  "purpose": "Unit testing functions in the wavefront_sdk.common.utils module and wavefront_sdk.entities for correctness.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; tests use hardcoded test data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that send untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "N/A - tests verify internal function outputs; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of test cases with no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or network connections are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The imports and test logic are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for utility functions, verifying expected behaviors with various inputs, including edge cases. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. No anomalies, hidden code, or malicious patterns are identified. The code only uses built-in and known utility functions from the package, with no external side effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign set of unit tests designed to verify utility functions. There is no indication of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to standard testing practices without suspicious activities.",
