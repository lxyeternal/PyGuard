  "purpose": "Unit tests for Wavefront Python SDK utility functions and data formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from wavefront_sdk.common.utils and wavefront_sdk.entities; no external input sources; uses static test data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output streams involved; no external data transmission or file operations.",
  "flows": "Tests invoke internal utility functions with static data; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit tests verifying utility functions for data formatting and version parsing. It uses static, known data inputs and expected outputs. No network connections, no system modifications, no credential handling, and no potential injection points are evident. The import statements are standard for testing. There are no code paths that process untrusted data or perform operations outside the testing scope. All functions tested are pure, with expected outputs, and exceptions are raised only for invalid input scenarios. Overall, the code serves its testing purpose without containing any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward suite of unit tests for SDK utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It uses static data and does not perform any network or system operations that could be exploited. The code appears safe and solely intended for validation of existing functions.",
