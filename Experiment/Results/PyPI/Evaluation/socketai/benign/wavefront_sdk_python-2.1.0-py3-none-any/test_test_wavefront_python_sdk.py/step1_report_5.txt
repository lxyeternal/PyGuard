{
  "purpose": "Unit testing functions in wavefront_sdk.common.utils for data sanitization, metric formatting, histogram formatting, and tracing span formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test inputs, method calls, and UUID values; it does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present. The code mainly generates formatted strings for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "The test data flows from predefined inputs into formatting functions, which produce string outputs; no external data flow or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward unit tests with no suspicious code or logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs unit testing on well-defined utility functions. All inputs are static or controlled, and outputs are validated against expected values. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The UUIDs and input strings are standard test data. The functions tested are primarily for string sanitization and formatting, with no external network or file system access. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for a Python SDK's utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. It strictly validates formatting functions with controlled test data.",
