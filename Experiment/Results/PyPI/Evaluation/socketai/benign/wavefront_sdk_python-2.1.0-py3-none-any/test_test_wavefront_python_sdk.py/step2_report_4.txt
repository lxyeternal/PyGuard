  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Focuses on unit testing utility functions with static data; no external data sources or sinks.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The tests are straightforward, verifying expected outputs.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard test code with no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is safe, with no anomalies or malicious activity. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, testing utility functions with internal data; no external data sources or sinks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no external communication, no suspicious code constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely for internal validation, benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature. Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Tests data formatting functions, no external input; no data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard unit tests, no malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent. Scores: **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, **risk=0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Verifies utility functions, static data, no external communication.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security threat.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. All scores should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above, unit tests with controlled data.\n- **Analysis:** No external input, no network activity, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. Scores: **0** for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a set of unit tests for utility functions, with static data, no external dependencies, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code is purely for testing and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a benign test suite verifying data formatting and sanitization functions within an SDK. It uses static, controlled data, and there are no indications of malicious intent, external communication, or security vulnerabilities. All the reports agree on this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, standard testing code with no security concerns.",
