  "purpose": "Unit testing functions of the wavefront_sdk.common.utils module and wavefront_sdk.entities for data formatting and sanitization.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments and test data within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "Data is formatted into strings for metrics, histograms, and tracing spans; no data is sent externally or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions, which sanitize and format data into specific string representations; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs standard unit testing routines with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases verifying data formatting functions such as get_sem_ver_value, sanitize, metric_to_line_data, histogram_to_line_data, and tracing_span_to_line_data. These functions process input data to produce formatted strings for metrics, histograms, and traces. There is no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor code. The use of UUIDs and data formatting is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior is detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or malicious intent. The functions tested are utility functions intended for data serialization, with no malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard suite of unit tests for data formatting utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no external communications, data leaks, or harmful actions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
