  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's testing SDK functions with no secrets or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a straightforward unit test suite, employing mocks and static data. No suspicious patterns, no code obfuscation, no malicious payloads. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with static UUIDs and test data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, network calls are mocked, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is standard unit testing with no malicious activity. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—unit tests with static data and mocks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, network calls mocked.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe only notable point is a small securityRisk (0.1). Since the code only performs testing with mocked network requests, this risk is minimal. The malware score remains 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable; the slight securityRisk score is justified given network interactions, even if mocked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static data, no untrusted input.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, network requests are mocked, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSimilar to previous, the small securityRisk score is justified due to network interactions, but these are within a test environment. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static data, mocks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no suspicious behavior, network calls mocked.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation observed.\n- **SecurityRisk scores:** Very low (0.1) in some reports, justified by the presence of network calls, but these are mocked in tests, so actual risk is negligible.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the static, controlled nature of the test code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Network interactions are mocked, reducing any real security concern.\n- The minimal securityRisk scores are justified due to network call patterns, but these are within a test context.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to network interactions, but negligible)  \n\nThe existing scores are appropriate and justified based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
