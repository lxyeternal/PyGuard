  "purpose": "Minimal Python code importing 'os' with an empty comment, likely a placeholder or incomplete snippet.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'os' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code does not process any input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '//' comment syntax, which is invalid in Python but appears as a placeholder or artifact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial import with no operational logic, data handling, or malicious activity. The '//' comment is syntactically invalid but harmless as a comment. All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with very low risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1), justified by the benign and placeholder nature of the code. The comments with '//' are noted as unusual but do not imply malicious intent. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate given the minimal content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The scores across all reports are consistent and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
