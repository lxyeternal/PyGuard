{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes (Subprocess and SubprocessLoop) from a local module named 'process', likely to handle subprocess management within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'process.py' in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this single import statement; it simply makes classes available in the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing classes Subprocess and SubprocessLoop from a local module. There is no processing, data handling, or behavior that could be malicious. Since it’s only an import, it cannot itself be malicious. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import of classes from a local module without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security concerns are identified.",
