  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module, which is typical in modular Python projects. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. As it only performs an import, it does not pose any immediate security risk or malicious behavior. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting solely of an import statement. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
