{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes 'Subprocess' and 'SubprocessLoop' from a local module 'process', likely to facilitate process management or subprocess handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'process'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only includes an import statement importing two classes from a local module. No processing, data handling, or external communication is visible. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The presence of the import suggests modular design, and the imported classes could be used for subprocess management, which by itself is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting solely of an import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this limited snippet.",
