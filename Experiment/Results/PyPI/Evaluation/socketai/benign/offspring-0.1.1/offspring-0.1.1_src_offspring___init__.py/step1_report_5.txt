  "purpose": "Import specific classes 'Subprocess' and 'SubprocessLoop' from a local module named 'process'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from '.process' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "Import flows from the local module into the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard import statement with no suspicious patterns or embedded code.",
  "analysis": "This code imports classes from a local module, likely part of a larger package. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are evident. As only an import statement, it does not pose a direct security risk. The classes 'Subprocess' and 'SubprocessLoop' could potentially be used maliciously if their implementations are harmful, but the import alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The line is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
