  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .process import Subprocess, SubprocessLoop  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a simple import statement from a local module `process`. \n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or processing is present.\n- The classes imported could be used for process management, which is common and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code itself is benign and does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly states that this is a benign import statement with no anomalies.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **No issues here.**\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also correctly notes the benign nature of the import.  \n- Slightly more detailed but still consistent.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **No issues here.**\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar to previous, mentions no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is acceptable given the minimal context.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (a small potential risk due to the imported classes, but not justified).  \n- **The small securityRisk score seems unwarranted; importing classes alone does not pose a risk.**\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Consistent with prior assessments.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **No issues.**\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar reasoning, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9).  \n- Security risk score of 0.1 is again questionable for an import statement.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Again, the small security risk seems unjustified.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of issues:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code.\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is not justified based solely on an import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust the securityRisk scores** to 0 for all reports, as an import statement from a local module is not a security risk by itself.\n- **Maintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.**  \n- **Confidence levels** are reasonable given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is straightforward, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The scores should reflect this, with all scores at zero, especially the security risk. The minor risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unjustified and should be corrected to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a revised report summary based on these conclusions?**",
