  "purpose": "The code imports classes 'Subprocess' and 'SubprocessLoop' from a local module named 'process'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('process.py' or similar) in the package.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no data or untrusted input is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present within this minimal snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for two classes from a local module. No additional logic, input handling, or external network operations are present. Since it is only an import, it neither introduces nor indicates any malicious behavior. The classes imported could be benign or malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. No signs of hidden or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, performing a standard import from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on this minimal content.",
