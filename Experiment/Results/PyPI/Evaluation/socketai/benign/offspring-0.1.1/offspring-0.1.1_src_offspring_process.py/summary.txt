  "conclusion": "The code is a standard subprocess management utility with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical process control routines. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content."
