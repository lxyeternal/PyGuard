  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard process management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious or suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal, reflecting standard process management.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard subprocess handling with signal management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk, possibly due to signal handling, but still standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard subprocess framework, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical subprocess management framework with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard subprocess management, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Scores align with the report.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential for process control issues but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, consistent with process management code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured subprocess management framework with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities evident from the provided analysis.",
