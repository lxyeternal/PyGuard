{
  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for managing subprocesses, including starting, stopping, and handling signals, with support for cleanup at exit.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are limited to function parameters, signals, and system calls such as multiprocessing.Process, atexit, and signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include process termination, system exit, and signal handling which could affect process control flow, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Main flow involves creating subprocess instances, starting them, handling signals, and cleanup at shutdown. Data flow from process creation to termination is straightforward; no untrusted data sources or malicious data paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard multiprocessing and signal handling without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The class structure and process management appear standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements subprocess management with clean startup, shutdown, and cleanup routines. It uses standard Python modules (multiprocessing, signal, atexit). No code injection, network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is observed. The design is typical for process control frameworks and does not contain hidden or malicious logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unconventional code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard subprocess management framework with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles process lifecycle and cleanup correctly, without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
