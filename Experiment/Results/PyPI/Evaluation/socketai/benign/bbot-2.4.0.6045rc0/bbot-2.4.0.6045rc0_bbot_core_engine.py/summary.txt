  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ZeroMQ-based async RPC system with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from unsafe deserialization using pickle on untrusted data, which could be exploited for remote code execution. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The overall security risk is high (~0.7), primarily due to the pickle vulnerability, but no active malicious behavior is present."
