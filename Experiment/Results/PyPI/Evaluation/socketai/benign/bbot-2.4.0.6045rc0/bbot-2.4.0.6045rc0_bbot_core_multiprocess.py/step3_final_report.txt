  "purpose": "Manage process IDs via environment variables to distinguish main and scan processes, preventing duplicate spawning.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID', calling os.getpid(), and environment variable updates.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modifications, cleanup of environment variables during exit.",
  "flows": "Read environment variables -> determine process role -> update environment variables -> cleanup environment variables on exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard environment variable handling and process management.",
  "analysis": "The code manages process state by storing process IDs in environment variables, with properties to check process roles, methods to update the scan process ID, and cleanup routines to remove environment variables on exit. It uses standard modules and practices, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The environment variables are used solely for process coordination, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign process management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard techniques for process coordination and cleanup, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
