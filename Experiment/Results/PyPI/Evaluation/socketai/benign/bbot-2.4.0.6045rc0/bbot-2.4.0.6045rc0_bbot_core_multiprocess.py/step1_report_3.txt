  "purpose": "Manage and track the primary and scan process IDs within a shared interpreter state to prevent spawning duplicate processes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID', process ID via os.getpid()",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables in os.environ, deleting environment variables during cleanup",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables to determine process roles, updating environment variables with current process ID, cleanup deleting environment variables based on process role",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. The code manipulates environment variables for process control but does not perform any unusual or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to track process states using environment variables, preventing multiple unwanted process spawns. It registers a cleanup method on exit to clear environment variables if the process is the main process. All operations are related to process ID management and environment variable handling, which are typical for process synchronization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The code appears benign and intended for process control within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard process management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely handles environment variables and process states without performing any harmful actions.",
