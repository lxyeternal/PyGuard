  "purpose": "Manage shared state for process identification and coordination in a multi-process environment.",
  "sources": "os.environ (reads environment variables), os.getpid() (reads process ID), atexit.register (registers cleanup function).",
  "sinks": "os.environ (writes environment variables), del os.environ (deletes environment variables).",
  "flows": "Reads process IDs from environment variables, updates environment variables with current process IDs, cleans up environment variables on exit.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables to store process IDs; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. No hidden backdoors or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to manage and track process IDs through environment variables, ensuring only one main process and one scan process. It uses environment variables for inter-process communication. The code employs suppress() to handle exceptions silently during cleanup. All operations are confined to process management without network activity, file modification, or external communication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code appears to be a standard process coordination utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a process state manager without any signs of malicious intent. It safely manages process identifiers via environment variables and performs cleanup at exit. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
