  "purpose": "Manage and track the primary and scan process identifiers (PIDs) for a multi-process application, ensuring only one main process and one scan process run simultaneously.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID'; accesses process ID via os.getpid().",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID' with process IDs.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables to determine process states, potentially sets environment variables if not present, and updates environment variables with current process ID.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables to manage process state; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious loops, or obfuscated code; standard environment management.",
  "analysis": "The code manages process states via environment variables, avoiding multiple process spawns in a multiprocessing context. It employs standard Python modules (os, atexit, suppress) without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident. The process management logic is typical for multi-process applications. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code structures. All code functions relate to process state handling and cleanup, with proper suppression of exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard process management utility that safely tracks process IDs using environment variables and ensures cleanup on exit. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
