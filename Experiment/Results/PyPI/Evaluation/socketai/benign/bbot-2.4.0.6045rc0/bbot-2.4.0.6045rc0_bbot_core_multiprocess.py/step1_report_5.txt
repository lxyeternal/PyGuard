  "purpose": "Manage and track the main and scan process IDs within a shared interpreter environment to prevent multiple unwanted process spawns.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables ' _BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID'; accessing process ID via os.getpid()",
  "sinks": "Setting environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID'; deleting environment variables during cleanup",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables to determine process state; setting environment variables with current process ID; deleting environment variables during cleanup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of environment variables for process management is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for tracking process IDs via environment variables and process IDs, with automatic cleanup registered at exit. It primarily reads environment variables and sets them if not already set, using os.environ and os.getpid(). The cleanup method deletes these variables if the process is the main process. There are no external data transmissions, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard process management logic, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as process state management without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond normal process environment handling.",
