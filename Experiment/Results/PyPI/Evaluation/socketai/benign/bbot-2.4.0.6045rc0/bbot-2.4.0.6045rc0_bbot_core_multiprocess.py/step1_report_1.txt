{
  "purpose": "Manage and track the main and scan process IDs within a shared interpreter environment to prevent unwanted multiple process spawning.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables '_BBOT_MAIN_PID' and '_BBOT_SCAN_PID', and current process ID via os.getpid().",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables 'os.environ' based on process ID checks and updates.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> determines process roles -> potentially sets or deletes environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Uses standard environment management; no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages process state using environment variables and process IDs, with methods to check if current process is main or scan process, updating environment variables accordingly. All actions are standard process management operations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate process management utility for avoiding multiple unwanted process spawns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
