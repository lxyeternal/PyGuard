{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions within a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only declares classes; it does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no functions or operations that process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "None, since this code only establishes class hierarchies without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, all with standard class declarations. No external data inputs, network interactions, or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or risky behavior. The code appears to be boilerplate for structured error handling in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions intended for structured error management. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely part of a larger application’s error handling framework.",
