{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application, likely related to security or network operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, specifically the creation of custom exception subclasses, do not read input or data.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or outputted by this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurs within class definitions; they only set up exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code solely defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. It is purely structural, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling. It appears designed for modular error handling in a larger system, possibly related to security or network tooling, but contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions; it contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and typical in application development.",
