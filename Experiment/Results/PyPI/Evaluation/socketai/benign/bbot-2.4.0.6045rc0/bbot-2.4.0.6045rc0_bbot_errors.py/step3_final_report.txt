{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base class BBOTError, serving as structured error types for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of error types; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class declarations with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions, with no methods, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard boilerplate for error handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, consistent across all assessments. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions, posing no security threat, containing no obfuscation, and suitable for structured error handling in a larger application. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
