  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no data processing, and no output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code solely defines exception classes without any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard pattern of custom exception hierarchy with inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from base Exception classes. No data input, output, or processing occurs. There are no obfuscation techniques, malicious patterns, or suspicious code behaviors. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an application or library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks present in this code snippet.",
