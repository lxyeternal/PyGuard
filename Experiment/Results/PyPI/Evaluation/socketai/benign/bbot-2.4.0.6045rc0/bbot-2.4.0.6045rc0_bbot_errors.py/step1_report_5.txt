  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance hierarchy; no input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is purely class declaration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of exception class declarations with no suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, BBOTError. No code execution, input handling, or external system interaction is present. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose appears to be structured error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. The classes are standard and serve as error types for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for structured error handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
