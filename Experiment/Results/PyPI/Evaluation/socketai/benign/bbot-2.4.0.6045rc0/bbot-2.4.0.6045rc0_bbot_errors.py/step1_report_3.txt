  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from base exception classes. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or security-sensitive operations are present. All classes are simple inheritance structures, used for structured error handling within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of error hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an error handling framework, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
