  "purpose": "Provides colorized logging output and gzip-compressed log rotation for a Python application.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, file operations during log rotation, environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Output to stderr via print, file system during log rotation and compression.",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence log output; log records trigger rotation; rotation compresses old logs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual log level abbreviations (e.g., 'DBUG', 'ERRR') but benign; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard logging enhancements: colorized output and gzip compression during rotation. No network activity, credential handling, or dynamic code execution present. The unconventional log level abbreviations are stylistic, not malicious. The gzip rotation is a common practice. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with clear logic and no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility with custom colorization and gzip log rotation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are appropriate based on the analysis.",
