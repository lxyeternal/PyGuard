  "purpose": "Define the package version and import classes for scanning functionality.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string, import statement from local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a release candidate suffix ('rc'), which is typical and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version identifier indicating a release candidate, which is standard practice. It then imports classes from a local module, likely part of the package's internal implementation. There are no inputs, no untrusted data handling, no code execution, or other suspicious activity. The code is minimal and appears to serve straightforward purposes without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple version assignment and module import with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. Overall, it is safe.",
