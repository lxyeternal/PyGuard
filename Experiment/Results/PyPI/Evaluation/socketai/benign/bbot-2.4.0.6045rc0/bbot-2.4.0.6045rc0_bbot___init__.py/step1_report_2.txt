{
  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package, with a placeholder for dynamic versioning, and import classes Scanner and Preset from a local module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string, import statement",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and import statements",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a placeholder comment indicating dynamic version replacement, but this is standard and not suspicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string with a placeholder comment for dynamic substitution, which is common in package versioning systems like Poetry. It then imports classes from a local module. No input handling, no data leakage, no suspicious code execution or network activity. The code appears straightforward and normal for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily setting a version string and importing classes. No malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
