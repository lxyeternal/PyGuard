  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# version placeholder (replaced by poetry-dynamic-versioning)\n__version__ = \"v2.4.0.6045rc\"\n\nfrom .scanner import Scanner, Preset\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define version placeholder and import classes.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no anomalies, benign.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The version string is a static assignment with a comment indicating it's a placeholder for dynamic replacement, which is standard practice.\n- The import is from a local module, with no suspicious behavior.\n- No data flows, no malicious code.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (benign)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)\n- Security risk: 0 (no issues)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (high confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar to report 1.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, standard version placeholder, normal import.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The placeholder comment for dynamic versioning is common.\n- No untrusted input or data flow.\n- The code is straightforward.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Placeholder for dynamic versioning, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The static assignment with a placeholder comment is typical.\n- No data flow or suspicious code.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define version, import classes.\n- Findings: Version string includes 'rc' suffix, which is standard for release candidates, not suspicious.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The 'rc' suffix indicates a release candidate, common in versioning.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to the 'rc' suffix, but this is standard.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (due to version suffix, but this is not a real risk)\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores seem reasonable; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Same as others.\n- Findings: Placeholder comment for dynamic versioning, no anomalies.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The placeholder comment is typical.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- The version string includes a 'rc' suffix, which is normal.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (due to placeholder comment, but this is benign)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the placeholder comment and version suffix, but these are standard practices and not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is simple, intended for versioning, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report overstates the risk; all are conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to version placeholder comments and 'rc' suffix, but these are standard and not risky)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code snippet is benign, with no security issues or malware present.",
