{
  "purpose": "Define a version string placeholder and import classes from a local module",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and import statement from local module '.scanner'",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment and import statements only",
  "anomalies": "Version string appears as a placeholder for dynamic versioning, but this alone is not suspicious; no malicious code or hidden behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string which indicates it's a placeholder intended to be replaced dynamically, possibly during build or deployment. The import from a local module suggests standard code structure. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module snippet setting a version string and importing classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
