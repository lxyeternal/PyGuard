  "purpose": "Define a version string placeholder for dynamic versioning and import classes from a local module.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = ...) and the import statement from .scanner.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment and import statements do not lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a string and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version placeholder comment indicating dynamic replacement, which is standard; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, assigning a version string with a placeholder comment and importing classes from a local module. No data flows, no user input, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The placeholder comment is common in version management. The 'rc' suffix in the version string is standard for release candidates. All security and malware scores should be zero, reflecting the benign nature. The small risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified due to the placeholder and version suffix but does not indicate actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version placeholders, and contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scoring should be maintained with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores at 0 or 0.1 as appropriate.",
