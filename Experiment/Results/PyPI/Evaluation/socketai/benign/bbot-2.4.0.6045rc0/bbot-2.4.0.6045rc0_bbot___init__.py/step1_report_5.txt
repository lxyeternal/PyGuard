  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package and imports classes for scanning functionality.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects the system or leaks data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets a version string and imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a placeholder comment indicating dynamic replacement; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, which appears to be dynamically replaced during build or deployment. The import statement loads classes from a local module, likely for use elsewhere. No suspicious or malicious code is present; the version placeholder suggests typical version management. No input, environment variable usage, or network activity detected. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module header setting a version and importing classes with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
