  "purpose": "Define the version of the package and import classes for scanning functionality",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statement from internal module",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external input observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply assigns a static version string and imports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; version string placeholder indicates dynamic replacement, but currently static",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string that is meant to be dynamically replaced by a build tool (poetry-dynamic-versioning). It imports classes Scanner and Preset from a local module. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No suspicious code behavior or data leaks are present. The static version string is a placeholder, but in its current form, it does not perform any malicious actions or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing only version assignment and module import. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The placeholder indicates intended dynamic versioning, which is a standard practice. Overall, the code appears benign.",
