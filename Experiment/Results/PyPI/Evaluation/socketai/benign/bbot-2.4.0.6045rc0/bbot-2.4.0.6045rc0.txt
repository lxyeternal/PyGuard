The 'kill <modules>' command is a standard control feature, not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard ZeroMQ-based async RPC system with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from unsafe deserialization using pickle on untrusted data, which could be exploited for remote code execution. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The overall security risk is high (~0.7), primarily due to the pickle vulnerability, but no active malicious behavior is present."

The risk score (0.2) reflects the inherent risk of executing external code and handling cache files, but no malicious intent is detected. Assuming trusted sources for modules, the overall security posture is acceptable."
