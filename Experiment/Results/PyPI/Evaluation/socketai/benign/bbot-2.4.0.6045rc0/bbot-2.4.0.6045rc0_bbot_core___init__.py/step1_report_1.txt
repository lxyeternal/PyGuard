  "purpose": "Importing BBOTCore class from a local module named core and creating an instance called CORE.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core import BBOTCore, which reads the local module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import reads the core module; the instantiation creates an object stored in CORE.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a class from a local module and creates an instance. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and typical for a module setup, with no external data input or untrusted data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply sets up a class instance from a local module.",
