  "flows": "Imported class 'BBOTCore' is instantiated and assigned to 'CORE'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'BBOTCore' from a local module, then creates an instance named 'CORE'. No input/output operations, no environment variable usage, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The structure appears typical for initializing a core component of a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, legitimate, and does not show any signs of malicious behavior. It only imports and instantiates a class, which is standard practice.",
