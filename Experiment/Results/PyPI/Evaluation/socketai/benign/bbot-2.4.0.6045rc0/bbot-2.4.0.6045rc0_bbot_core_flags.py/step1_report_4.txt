  "purpose": "Definition of a dictionary mapping scan flags to their descriptions for a network/security scanning tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or effects; the code only defines data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a static data structure with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward dictionary assignment with descriptive strings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single dictionary variable containing string key-value pairs describing various scan flags and their functions. It is static data used likely for documentation or internal reference. There are no input sources, data flows, or execution that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or potential security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static dictionary defining scan flag descriptions with no malicious or security risks. It appears to be part of documentation or configuration, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
