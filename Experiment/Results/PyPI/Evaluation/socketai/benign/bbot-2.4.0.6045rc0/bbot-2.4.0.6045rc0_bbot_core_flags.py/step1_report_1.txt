{
  "purpose": "Definition of a dictionary mapping scan flags to their descriptions for a network security or reconnaissance tool.",
  "sources": "The dictionary is hardcoded within the code, no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified, as the code does not perform any operations that process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static mapping of string keys to descriptive strings, likely used for configuring or describing features of a network scanning tool. It contains no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior. The structure appears straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. All entries are descriptive labels for scan modes or features, with no embedded code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static dictionary for descriptive purposes in a network scanning context. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
