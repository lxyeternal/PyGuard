  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping scan flags to their descriptions for a network scanning tool",
  "sources": "The dictionary definition is hardcoded; no external input sources are present",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no external or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code is a static mapping without execution flow or data processing",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and well-structured; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary assignment containing descriptive strings for various scan flags. It does not include any dynamic code, external data sources, or sensitive information. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be part of a larger application defining options for a scanning utility. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static dictionary defining scan flag descriptions. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
