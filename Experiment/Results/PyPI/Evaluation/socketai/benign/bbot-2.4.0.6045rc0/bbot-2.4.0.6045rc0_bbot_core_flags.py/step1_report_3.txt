  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping scan flags to their descriptions for a network security or reconnaissance tool.",
  "sources": "The dictionary is a static data structure initialized with key-value pairs; no input sources are present.",
  "targets": "There are no sinks or data flow targets; no untrusted data handling or output is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows involving external or untrusted data are present; the code only creates a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with descriptive strings for various network scanning flags. It appears to be part of a larger application, likely a reconnaissance or security scanning tool. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data interactions are present, reducing the likelihood of malicious behavior. The content is static and intended for descriptive purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static data structure defining scan options and descriptions. It poses no security risks or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
