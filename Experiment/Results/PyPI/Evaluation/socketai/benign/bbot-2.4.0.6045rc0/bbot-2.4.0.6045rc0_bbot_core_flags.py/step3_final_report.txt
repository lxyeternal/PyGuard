  "purpose": "Static dictionary defining scan flag descriptions for a network scanning tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static data structure defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static data with no execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary mapping descriptive labels to scan flags. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and harmless nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose appears to be for configuration or documentation within a larger tool, and it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and should remain at zero. No further action is necessary.",
