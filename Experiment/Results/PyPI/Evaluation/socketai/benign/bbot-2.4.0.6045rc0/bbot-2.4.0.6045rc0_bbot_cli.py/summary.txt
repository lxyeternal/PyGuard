  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI for a security OSINT tool, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. The 'kill <modules>' command is a standard control feature, not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate."
