  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plugin loader with no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The risk score (0.2) reflects the inherent risk of executing external code and handling cache files, but no malicious intent is detected. Assuming trusted sources for modules, the overall security posture is acceptable."
