{
  "purpose": "The code provides encryption and decryption functions for attachments, using AES CBC mode with HMAC for integrity, and includes padding and digest verification.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'attachment' and 'key' parameters, as well as ciphertext inputs for decryption, which are read from external sources during function calls.",
  "sinks": "The code writes encrypted data (ciphertext) as output, and raises exceptions on errors; no data is transmitted over networks or written to external storage within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (attachment, keys, ciphertext) flow through padding, encryption, MAC computation, and concatenation in 'encrypt_attachment'; during decryption, ciphertext flows through MAC verification, digest check, and unpadding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of standard cryptographic libraries and functions; exception messages are descriptive but do not reveal sensitive info. No suspicious or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic practices with AES CBC and HMAC-SHA256 for integrity. Padding is correctly handled with PKCS5, and digest verification is performed during decryption. The key length requirement is strict (64 bytes), splitting into encryption and MAC keys. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of encrypted attachment handling with integrity checks. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage in this module.",
