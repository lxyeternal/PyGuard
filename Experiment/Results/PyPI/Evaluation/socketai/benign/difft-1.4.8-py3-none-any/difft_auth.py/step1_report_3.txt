  "purpose": "This code implements an authentication mechanism using HMAC signatures for HTTP requests, providing secure signing of request data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request URL, headers, body, and query parameters. Uses external functions get_nonce() and current_milli_time().",
  "sinks": "Uses hmac to generate signatures, which are added as headers to the request.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, headers, body) -> build_data() constructs string -> sign() creates HMAC signature -> signature and metadata inserted into headers.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses get_nonce() and current_milli_time() for signature creation, which are typical for secure signing, no evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unsafe eval or obfuscated code. No suspicious external calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing request signatures using HMAC SHA256. It collects request method, URI, headers, and query parameters, then builds a data string for signing. The sign() method generates a timestamp, nonce, and computes an HMAC signature. The resulting signature and metadata are added to request headers. No hardcoded secrets, malicious data leaks, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code follows standard cryptographic signing procedures and does not include malicious or maliciously intended actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of request signing for API authentication. No malicious or maliciously intended behaviors are evident. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. It is a typical secure signing mechanism with no signs of malware.",
