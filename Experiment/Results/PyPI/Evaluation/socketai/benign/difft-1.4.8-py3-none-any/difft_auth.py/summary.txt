  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented request signing utility for API authentication, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects minor side-effect potential due to list mutation but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and aligns with best practices for request signing."
