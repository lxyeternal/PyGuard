{
  "purpose": "Implements an HMAC SHA-256 request signing mechanism to authenticate API requests by generating signatures based on request details and attaching them as headers.",
  "sources": "Request method, URL (path and query parameters), headers, and body of the HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Request headers where signature metadata (app ID, timestamp, nonce, algorithm, signed headers, signature) are inserted, influencing request authentication.",
  "flows": "Extracts request method, URL, headers, and body; constructs a canonical string; signs it with HMAC SHA-256; attaches signature info into request headers.",
  "anomalies": "Minor side-effect: the constructor appends header names to the provided headers list, potentially mutating shared data; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic request signing using HMAC SHA-256, constructing a canonical string from request components, signing it with a secret key, and appending relevant headers. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. External functions for nonce and timestamp generation are assumed standard. The only minor concern is the mutation of the headers list passed during initialization, which could cause side-effects if shared, but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented request signing utility for API authentication, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects minor side-effect potential due to list mutation but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and aligns with best practices for request signing.",
