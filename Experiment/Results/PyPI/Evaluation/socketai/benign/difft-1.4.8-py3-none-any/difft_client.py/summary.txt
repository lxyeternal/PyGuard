  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The cryptographic functions are used appropriately, and network communications are standard. The security risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, with a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting typical operational concerns. No modifications are necessary."
