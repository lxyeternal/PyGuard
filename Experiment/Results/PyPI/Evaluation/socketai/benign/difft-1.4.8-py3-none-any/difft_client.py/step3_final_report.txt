  "purpose": "A Python API client wrapper for the Difft platform, handling authentication, media uploads/downloads, messaging, and group management.",
  "sources": "HTTP request responses, file I/O, cryptographic functions (hashing, encrypt/decrypt), external cryptographic functions, user input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs, data returned from HTTP responses, file writes, cryptographic operations, data passed to external functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (files, parameters) processed through cryptographic functions, sent via HTTP requests, responses parsed and returned, with cryptographic data used in download/decrypt processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no hidden network activity, no malicious payloads, external cryptographic functions assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client performing standard network operations with cryptographic handling for attachments. It uses external cryptographic functions without signs of malicious manipulation. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, and network interactions follow typical patterns. Cryptography is used for hashing and encryption, but the internal implementation of encrypt_attachment and decrypt_attachment is external and assumed secure. No suspicious URLs, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate API client functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The cryptographic functions are used appropriately, and network communications are standard. The security risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, with a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting typical operational concerns. No modifications are necessary.",
