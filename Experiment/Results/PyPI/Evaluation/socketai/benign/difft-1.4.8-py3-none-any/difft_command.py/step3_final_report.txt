  "purpose": "CLI utility for sending messages, sending cards, and querying account/group info via the DifftClient API.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (.difft.cfg, ~/.difft.cfg), command-line arguments, attachment files read from disk.",
  "sinks": "API calls to DifftClient methods, print statements for errors and outputs, file reads for attachments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and config data → API request construction → API call execution → output/error printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Error messages are printed directly, which could leak info but is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the DifftClient API, handling configuration, user input, and API interactions. It reads files directly for attachments, constructs messages, and sends them. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The only minor concern is error message leakage, but this does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI client for messaging operations with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
