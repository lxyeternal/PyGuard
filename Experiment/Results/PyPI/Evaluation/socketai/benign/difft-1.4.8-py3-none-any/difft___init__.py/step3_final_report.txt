  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code input points such as functions, variables, environment variables, network calls, file operations, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network exfiltration, system modifications, or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Source points like hardcoded secrets or eval/exec leading to execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, unusual imports, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution (eval/exec) with hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. No active malicious payloads or network connections are confirmed, but the indicators suggest elevated risk. The obfuscation score (0.8) is justified; malware potential (0.4) is moderate but could be slightly higher if malicious payloads are confirmed. The security risk (0.65) appropriately reflects the potential threat. Benign scripts lack suspicious patterns and are scored accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a recommendation to slightly increase malware risk if further malicious activity is confirmed. Overall, the assessment aligns with the described indicators and best practices.",
