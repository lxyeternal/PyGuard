  "purpose": "A builder class for constructing message request objects with various configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods such as sender(), to_user(), message(), to_group(), at_user(), attachment(), quote(), recall(), card(), forwarded().",
  "sinks": "Updates to the self.message_request dictionary, which is returned by build(). No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into self.message_request through method calls; no external or untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution observed. The use of current_milli_time() for timestamps is standard; no suspicious references.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for assembling message request objects with multiple optional components. It relies on external input parameters to update a dictionary, which is returned for further processing. The use of current_milli_time() for timestamps is typical. No insecure or malicious code behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, is present. The methods appear to perform straightforward dictionary updates with user-provided data. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only external function, current_milli_time(), is assumed to be benign, as it is imported from difft.utils and used solely for timestamping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard builder pattern implementation for message objects, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform network operations or handle sensitive data insecurely. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
