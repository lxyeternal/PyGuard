  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content Summary:** Utility functions + response parser decorator. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The functions generate random strings, UUIDs, timestamps, and parse server responses with proper validation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. The low security risk seems appropriate given the benign functions.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The minimal security risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content Summary:** Similar utility functions + response parser. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Functions are standard, with proper validation. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's confidence and scoring are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content Summary:** Same pattern, standard utility functions and response parser.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still low; justified given the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content Summary:** Standard utility functions, response validation.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content Summary:** Utility functions + response parser, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** All functions are standard, with proper validation and no suspicious operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign utility functions and response handlers.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, justified by the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard utility code with no security concerns)\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is standard utility functions and a response parser, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.  \n- The scoring aligns with the code's behavior.  \n- No adjustments needed.",
