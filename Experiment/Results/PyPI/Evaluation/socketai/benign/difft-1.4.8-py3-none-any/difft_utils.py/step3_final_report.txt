  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating random strings, UUIDs, timestamps, and a decorator for parsing server responses.",
  "sources": "random.choice for random strings, uuid.uuid4 for nonces, time.time for timestamps, resp.text for server response parsing",
  "sinks": "resp.text is parsed with json.loads; exceptions are raised on invalid responses",
  "flows": "resp.text (source) -> json.loads -> response validation -> return data or raise exception",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and a response parser decorator that validates server responses. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions generate random data and handle server responses securely. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The response parser raises exceptions on error responses, which is standard. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
