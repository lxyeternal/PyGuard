  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe utility functions and a response parser decorator.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The functions use standard libraries and perform common tasks.\n- The response parser validates server responses and raises exceptions on errors.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies utility functions and a response parser.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (minimal).\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed to scores or conclusions.\n- The code is a standard utility module with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0), depending on whether you consider the minimal risk of response handling errors, but given the analysis, 0 is justified.\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and the reports are accurate. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
