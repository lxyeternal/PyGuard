  "purpose": "Define constants for cryptographic algorithms, HTTP headers, and API endpoint URLs used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data; it only declares string constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The constants appear standard for API authentication and resource endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions for cryptographic algorithms, HTTP headers, and API endpoint URLs. These are typical for setting up request signatures and REST API interactions. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no logic that could be exploited or indicates malicious intent. The constants seem to serve standard purposes in an API client or server context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static configuration constants for API signatures and URLs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of an API interaction setup.",
