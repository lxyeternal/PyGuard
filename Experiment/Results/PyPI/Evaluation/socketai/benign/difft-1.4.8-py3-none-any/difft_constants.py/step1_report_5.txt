  "purpose": "Define constants for cryptographic algorithm and HTTP header names and API endpoints related to file operations, messaging, and account management.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, including cryptographic algorithm and URL endpoints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or data handling functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL patterns, or unusual code structures are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions for algorithms, HTTP headers, and API URLs. There are no input, output, or data processing functions. The constants appear to be for use in API request construction and cryptographic operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for cryptographic and API parameters, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a benign configuration or utility module.",
