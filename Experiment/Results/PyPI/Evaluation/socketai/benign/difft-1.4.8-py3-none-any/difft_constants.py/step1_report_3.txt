{
  "purpose": "Define constants for cryptographic algorithm and HTTP headers/URLs used in an API or SDK for file management and messaging.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments for algorithm name, header names, and URL endpoints.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or processing observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static string constants related to cryptography and API endpoints, likely for use in request signing and API interactions. No data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Constants appear to be standard API components for a file/messaging system.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for cryptographic and API parameters with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup for an SDK or API client.",
