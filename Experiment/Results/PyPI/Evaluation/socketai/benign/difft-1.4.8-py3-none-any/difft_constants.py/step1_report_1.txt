{
  "purpose": "Define constants for cryptographic algorithms, HTTP header names, and API endpoint URLs for a web service or API client.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string literals; no input reading or data sourcing present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; constants are used for request headers and URL endpoints.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as configuration or reference values; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; straightforward declaration of constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines cryptographic algorithm identifiers, HTTP header names for signature validation, and API endpoint paths. There is no processing, input handling, or dynamic behavior. It appears to be configuration data used for secure communication with an API, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely contains static constant definitions related to API request signatures and endpoints. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The constants are typical for an API client setup.",
