  "purpose": "Define constants for security headers and API endpoints used in a file and messaging service.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions; no dynamic input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; these are static configuration constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists solely of constant string assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of string constants for headers related to request signatures and URL endpoints for various API functions. There is no input parsing, data processing, or execution logic. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present. The constants are typical for API design and do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static constant definitions for API headers and endpoints, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard configuration or protocol setup for an API client or server.",
