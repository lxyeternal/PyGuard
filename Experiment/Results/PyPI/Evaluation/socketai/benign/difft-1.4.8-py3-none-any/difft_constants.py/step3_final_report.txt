  "purpose": "Defines cryptographic algorithm, HTTP header names, and API endpoint URLs for secure communication and resource management.",
  "sources": "Static string constants for algorithms, headers, and URLs",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None; constants are standalone and do not process data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static configuration data",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining cryptographic algorithms, HTTP headers, and API endpoints. There is no dynamic behavior, input handling, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is justified. The code functions as configuration data for API interactions, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constants used for API security and resource referencing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are accurate and appropriate.",
