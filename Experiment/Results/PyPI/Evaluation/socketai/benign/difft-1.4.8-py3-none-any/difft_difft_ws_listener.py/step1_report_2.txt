  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket client for connecting to a server, authenticating via signed headers, and handling message exchange and reconnection logic.",
  "sources": "Reads appid, key (for authentication), and incoming WebSocket messages.",
  "sinks": "Uses websocket.send() to send fetch and commit commands; processes incoming messages; logs errors and info.",
  "flows": "Authenticator generates signatures from appid and key (source), which are used in WebSocket headers; messages are received and parsed; commands sent via ws.send().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond the appid and key (assumed supplied securely); no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed; standard reconnection and heartbeat logic; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket connection with authentication via signed headers, using the 'websocket' and 'rel' libraries. It handles connection lifecycle, including reconnections, error handling, and message processing. Incoming messages are parsed as JSON, and message data are passed to a handler. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity is present. All communication appears standard for a WebSocket client. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden functionalities. It seems to be a legitimate implementation of a WebSocket listener with proper error handling and reconnection logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a WebSocket client with authentication, message handling, and reconnection logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It appears to be a normal, secure implementation of a WebSocket communication client.",
