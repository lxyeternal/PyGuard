{
  "purpose": "WebSocket client for connecting to a Difft API service, handling messages, and maintaining connection with retries.",
  "sources": "Input data from WebSocket messages received in 'on_message' and data used for signing in 'start' method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external files, databases, or network endpoints apart from WebSocket communication.",
  "flows": "Authentication data generated in 'start' -> WebSocket connection established -> Messages received in 'on_message' -> Message data passed to handler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket client with authentication via signature. It uses standard libraries and a third-party websocket library. Authentication signatures are generated and sent in headers. The message handling parses JSON messages and passes 'data' to a handler function. Error handling includes retries with delay. No signs of malicious activities like data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or suspicious network activity were identified. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical WebSocket client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket client implementation for interacting with an API, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles connections, retries, and message parsing securely and transparently.",
