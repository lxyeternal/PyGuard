{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket client that authenticates via signed headers, maintains persistent connection with retries, and processes incoming messages through an external handler.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'appid' and 'key' parameters for authentication; incoming WebSocket messages from the server.",
  "sinks": "The message handler function receives data; the code sends commands ('fetch', 'commit') over the WebSocket connection.",
  "flows": "Authentication data is signed and sent as headers during connection; incoming messages are parsed and passed to the handler; commands are sent via ws.send().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Error handling and reconnection logic are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket client with proper authentication, error handling, and reconnection. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Message parsing is straightforward, and external dependencies are assumed secure. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure WebSocket client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. External dependencies should be verified separately, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
