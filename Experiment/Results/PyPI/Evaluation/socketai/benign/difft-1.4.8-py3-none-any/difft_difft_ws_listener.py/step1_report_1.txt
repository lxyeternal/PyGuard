  "purpose": "WebSocket client for real-time message handling and reconnection logic with authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads application id, key, and incoming websocket messages.",
  "sinks": "Sends fetch and commit commands over websocket, handles errors and reconnections.",
  "flows": "Uses appid and key to authenticate, establishes websocket connection, receives messages, processes 'messages' data, handles errors, and reconnects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors, standard websocket handling. The code performs typical WebSocket operations with retries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a WebSocket client that authenticates using provided credentials, maintains persistent connection with automatic retries, and processes incoming messages. No hardcoded secrets beyond the 'key' parameter, no suspicious network activity is evident, and the logic aligns with expected behavior for such a client. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and all operations are standard. The only potential concern is the handling of messages which could be exploited if message handlers are insecure, but that depends on external handler implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard WebSocket client implementation with reconnection, heartbeat, and message processing. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected within this module. It functions as intended for real-time websocket communication without evident security risks.",
