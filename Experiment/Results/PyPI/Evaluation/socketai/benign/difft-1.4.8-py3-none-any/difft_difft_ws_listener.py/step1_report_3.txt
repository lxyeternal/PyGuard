  "purpose": "WebSocket client that authenticates and maintains a persistent connection to a server, handling messages and connection events.",
  "sources": "Input data from WebSocket messages received via on_message, and the initial authentication data generated in start().",
  "sinks": "Sending data via ws.send in fetch() and close() methods; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Authentication data generated in start() → WebSocket connection established → Messages received in on_message → Potentially triggers message_handler → Sending fetch and close commands over WebSocket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of WebSocket and JSON. No unusual or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket client with authentication, reconnection, and message handling. Authentication details are generated via the Authenticator class, but no secrets are hardcoded within this module. Connection management includes retries and signal handling. The message handler processes incoming messages, which are expected to contain 'messages' with 'data'. The code logs errors and manages connection states. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. All network interactions appear standard for a WebSocket-based API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket client for server communication, with proper handling and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No malware, data leakage, or malicious intents are evident.",
