  "purpose": "A builder class for constructing attachment data dictionaries with various properties.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as authorize_id, key, file_size, file_name, cipher_hash, content_type, flags, width, height, preview, caption, url.",
  "sinks": "The build() method returns the constructed dictionary; no direct sinks of untrusted data are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the internal _attachment dictionary through setter methods, and the final dictionary is returned by build().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns observed. The class simply stores and returns data without processing or validation.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a straightforward data container with chainable setter methods for various attachment attributes. It does not perform any validation, external calls, or data manipulation beyond storing input values. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a simple data structure builder, typical in many applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign builder class for assembling attachment metadata. It does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it interact with external systems or handle untrusted data beyond storing it. No security concerns identified.",
