  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the class as a straightforward builder pattern implementation.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are noted.\n- The class only stores input parameters into a dictionary and returns it.\n- No external calls, network operations, or data leaks are evident.\n- No validation, sanitization, or security checks are performed, but this is typical for such utility classes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious behavior or malware:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The lack of input validation could be a concern in a broader security context, but it does not imply malicious activity.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0 across reports.\n  - Security risk: very low (0.1), acknowledging minimal potential for data injection if inputs are untrusted.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as expected.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Given the benign nature, the scores seem appropriate.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, considering the lack of validation, but it does not elevate to a serious risk.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard builder pattern class.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for unvalidated input handling but not malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
