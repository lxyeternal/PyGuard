  "purpose": "A builder class to construct an attachment object with various optional attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data provided through method parameters such as authorize_id, key, file_size, file_name, cipher_hash, content_type, flags, width, height, preview, caption, url.",
  "sinks": "No critical sinks such as database queries, system calls, or network transmissions are present. Data is stored in a dictionary and returned.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into the internal dictionary (_attachment) via setter methods, then the build() method returns this dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The class functions as a typical data container builder.",
  "analysis": "The class provides setter methods that assign provided values to a dictionary representing an attachment. There are no data sanitization, validation, or security checks. No direct or indirect code execution, network communication, or malicious operations are evident. The design is straightforward, focused on data encapsulation. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple data builder for attachments with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It poses minimal security risks, mainly potential for data injection if external inputs are not validated elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this code fragment.",
