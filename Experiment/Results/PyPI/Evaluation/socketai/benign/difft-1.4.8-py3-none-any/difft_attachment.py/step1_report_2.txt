  "purpose": "A builder class for constructing an attachment dictionary with various properties",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as authorize_id, key, file_size, file_name, cipher_hash, content_type, flags, width, height, preview, caption, url",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the _attachment dictionary through setter methods, then the build() method outputs the dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unusual dynamic code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a fluent interface for constructing a dictionary representing an attachment. It accepts various parameters that are stored directly in an internal dict. There are no external calls, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a standard builder pattern implementation without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward builder class for creating attachment data structures. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies are observed. It appears safe and benign.",
