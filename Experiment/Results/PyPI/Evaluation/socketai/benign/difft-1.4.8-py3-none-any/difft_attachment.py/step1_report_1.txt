  "purpose": "A builder class for creating attachment data structures with various properties such as content type, size, URL, and others.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods like authorize_id, key, file_size, file_name, digest, content_type, flags, width, height, preview, caption, url.",
  "sinks": "The build() method outputs the constructed attachment dictionary. No other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input methods (sources) set values in the internal _attachment dictionary; build() returns this dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; methods are straightforward setters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class functions as a standard builder pattern, accumulating data via setter methods and returning a dictionary. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code only manipulates internal state and provides an interface for constructing a data object.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign builder class intended for assembling attachment data. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
