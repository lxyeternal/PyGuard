{
  "purpose": "This class is designed to build an attachment dictionary with various optional properties such as content type, size, filename, digest, URL, etc.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method arguments provided by the user (e.g., authorize_id, key, file_size, url, etc.)",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the '_attachment' dictionary which stores user-provided values; no direct data leakage or insecure sink observed",
  "flows": "User calls various setter methods to assign values to the '_attachment' dict, culminating in the 'build()' method returning the constructed dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external network calls or data leaks are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward builder pattern implementation for assembling a dictionary representing an attachment object. It only assigns user-provided input to dictionary fields without any processing, validation, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The structure and format are standard, with no obfuscated or complex code features. The absence of data validation or sanitization might be a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious builder class for assembling attachment data. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a benign utility with no security risks beyond typical input validation considerations.",
