  "purpose": "A builder class for constructing attachment data dictionaries with chainable setter methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided to each setter method (e.g., authorize_id, key, file_size, etc.)",
  "sinks": "The final dictionary returned by build(), which could be used downstream; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from each setter method into the internal _attachment dictionary, culminating in the build() method returning this dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple builder pattern for assembling a dictionary of attachment attributes. It contains chainable methods that assign input values to internal keys, with no validation, sanitization, or external interactions. The class does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal security risk score accounts for potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data builder with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
