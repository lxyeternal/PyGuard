  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and version tuple at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, standard comments indicating auto-generation, no suspicious behavior or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains static variables defining the package version, with comments indicating it was generated by setuptools_scm. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, no network access, or any suspicious activity. The comments explicitly state not to change or track in version control, typical for auto-generated files. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply stores version information for the package.",
