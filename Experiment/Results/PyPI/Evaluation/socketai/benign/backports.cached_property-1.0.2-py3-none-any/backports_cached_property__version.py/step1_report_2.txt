  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data assigning version info to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or untrusted sources; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating automatic generation; no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static version strings to variables with a comment indicating it was generated by setuptools_scm. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The comments suggest standard, auto-generated versioning information. There are no obfuscation indicators, hidden behaviors, or malicious code. This is typical version info code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version definition for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
