  "purpose": "Extend the current module's __path__ for package resource discovery",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify __path__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transfer occurs",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using data from 'pkgutil.extend_path' without external input or untrusted data sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of 'pkgutil.extend_path' for package resource management",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__, then extends __path__ with 'extend_path', which is standard for package resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. This pattern is common in namespace packages to include resources from multiple locations. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used for package resource management in Python. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
