  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility or namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code modifies '__path__' using 'extend_path', which is a standard operation for namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses a common pattern for namespace packages without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' with 'extend_path', a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages. No input sources, untrusted data, or sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unusual behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign snippet for extending package search paths and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
