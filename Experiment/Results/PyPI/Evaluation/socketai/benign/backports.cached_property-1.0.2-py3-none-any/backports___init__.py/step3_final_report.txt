  "purpose": "Extend __path__ for namespace package support using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' to extending __path__, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, straightforward and well-understood.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a common Python pattern for namespace packages, importing 'pkgutil' dynamically and extending __path__. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The pattern is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support in Python. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
