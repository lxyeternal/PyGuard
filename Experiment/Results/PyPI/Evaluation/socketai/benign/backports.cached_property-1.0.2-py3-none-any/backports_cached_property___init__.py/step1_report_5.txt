{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport implementation of Python 3.8's functools.cached_property for earlier Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, local _version module, standard library modules (functools, threading, typing).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — primarily defines a class for caching property values within an object, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward reimplementation of a standard library feature, with no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or suspicious variables.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks the Python version, then either imports the built-in cached_property or defines a custom class. The custom class uses standard threading locks and class properties to cache computed values per instance. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. All code appears to be a standard, well-understood pattern for caching properties, with no signs of backdoors, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a cached property pattern, used to optimize property computations with thread safety. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
