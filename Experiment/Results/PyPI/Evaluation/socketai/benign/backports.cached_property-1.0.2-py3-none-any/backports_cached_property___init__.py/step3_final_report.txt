{
  "purpose": "Compatibility backport of functools.cached_property for Python versions earlier than 3.8, providing a thread-safe cached property decorator.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function to be decorated during initialization; accesses instance.__dict__ during property retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the cache stored in instance.__dict__ could contain sensitive data if misused, but no external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The decorator's __get__ method retrieves or computes the cached value, storing it in instance.__dict__, which is then returned on subsequent access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard implementation with proper error handling and thread safety measures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented implementation of a cached property decorator for backward compatibility. It uses threading locks to ensure thread safety and handles cases where __dict__ may be missing or not support item assignment. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are present. The cache is stored in the instance's __dict__, which is typical and does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to cache contents potentially holding sensitive data, but this is inherent to caching mechanisms and not a flaw.\n\nThe code aligns with standard practices, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The implementation is clear, correct, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a cached property decorator for Python versions earlier than 3.8. It exhibits no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score around 0.1 due to cache handling considerations.",
