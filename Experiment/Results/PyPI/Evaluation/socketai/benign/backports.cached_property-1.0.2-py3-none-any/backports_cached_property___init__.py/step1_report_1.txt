  "purpose": "Provide a compatibility backport for functools.cached_property for Python versions earlier than 3.8, implementing a cached property decorator.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, functools, threading, typing, and conditional local version import.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines a class and functions related to property caching.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows involving untrusted input or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard implementation of a cached property with thread safety and version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to determine whether to use the built-in cached_property or define a custom thread-safe implementation. The custom class caches computed property values in the instance's __dict__, with proper locking to ensure thread safety. The class includes safeguards against multiple attribute names and missing __dict__ attributes, raising appropriate TypeErrors. No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are evident. It appears to be a straightforward, compatible implementation of a common pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a cached property decorator for Python versions earlier than 3.8, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
