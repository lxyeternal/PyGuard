      "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The formulas are standard Excel expressions, and the script performs a simple task of writing these formulas into an Excel file. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified but could be considered zero since there is no external input or dynamic evaluation involved. Overall, the script is safe and suitable for use as a utility for generating spreadsheets with formulas."
