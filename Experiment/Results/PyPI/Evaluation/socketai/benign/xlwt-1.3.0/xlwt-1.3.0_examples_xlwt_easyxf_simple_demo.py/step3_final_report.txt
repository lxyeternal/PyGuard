  "purpose": "Generate a styled Excel (.xls) file with a header row and multiple data rows, using static data and formatting.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the script, including date objects and static strings; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated Excel file to disk; no network activity or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local variables (headings, data, styles) into the file creation and saving process; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that creates an Excel file with styled headers and data, using only static, hardcoded data. It employs standard library functions without obfuscation or network activity. The data includes date objects created via datetime, but these are benign. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The styling and formatting are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure is clear and maintainable, with no anomalies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for generating styled Excel files with static data. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
