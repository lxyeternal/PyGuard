  "purpose": "The code generates an Excel XLS file with specified headers and data, formatting the cells accordingly.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (file_name, sheet_name, headings, data, heading_xf, data_xfs); internal data initialization (dates, data rows).",
  "sinks": "Saving the Excel file with 'book.save(file_name)'.",
  "flows": "Data and formatting definitions flow into the write_xls function; data is written to the sheet; final file is saved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of xlwt for safe Excel file creation. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes styling objects and data, then writes structured data to an XLS file using xlwt. It applies formatting and creates a spreadsheet with headers and data rows, including date, text, and numeric types. The process is straightforward, with no external data fetching, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The data and formatting are static and well-defined. No unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no potential injection points identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured example of generating an Excel file with formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is safe for use and has no security concerns.",
