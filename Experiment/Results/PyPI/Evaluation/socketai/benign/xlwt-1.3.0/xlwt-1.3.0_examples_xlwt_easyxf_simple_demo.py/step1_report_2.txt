  "purpose": "Generate an XLS file with a header and data rows, applying styles and formatting.",
  "sources": "Data is sourced from hardcoded lists, and date values are generated from the datetime.date constructor.",
  "sinks": "File system write operation via book.save; no other untrusted sinks present.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded data flows into styling and file save functions; no external inputs or untrusted data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries (xlwt and datetime) for creating an Excel file with styled headers and data rows. Data is hardcoded, with date values created via datetime.date. The file is saved locally without any external input or network activity. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code performs a straightforward file creation task with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for creating styled Excel files with predefined data. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
