  "purpose": "Generate a styled Excel spreadsheet with varying fonts, colors, and borders using the 'xlwt' library.",
  "sources": "Static code defining styles and writing data to the worksheet; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing styled data into an Excel file ('format.xls') locally; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Code initializes styles and fonts, then writes static and styled data into the worksheet within a loop, saving the file locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an Excel file with styled cells, fonts, and borders, all based on static parameters. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static utility for generating styled Excel spreadsheets. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The current assessment scores are appropriate and justified.",
