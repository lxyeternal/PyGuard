  "purpose": "Constructs an Excel formula string involving arithmetic and functions using xlwt library classes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the formula string is hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only creates a formula object in memory.",
  "flows": "Static formula string assigned to an ExcelFormula.Formula object; no data flow or execution beyond construction.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of sys; commented-out code for parsing, but no suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from xlwt to build an Excel formula involving standard functions and arithmetic. It does not execute or evaluate the formula, nor does it involve external inputs or network activity. The formula is static and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The unused sys import is harmless. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static construction of an Excel formula with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
