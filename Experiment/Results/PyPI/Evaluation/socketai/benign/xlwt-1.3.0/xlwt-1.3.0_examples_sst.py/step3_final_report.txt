  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file with styled fonts and large static data entries, primarily for testing or stress testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string ('Olya' * 0x4000) written into cell (0,0). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing large static data into a cell; no data leaks or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static large string source directly written into cell (0,0). No dynamic data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a very large, static string ('Olya' repeated 0x4000 times) that could cause resource exhaustion; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines fonts and styles, creates an Excel workbook, and writes a large static string into a cell. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated logic are present. The large data payload could cause performance issues but is not malicious. Commented-out code suggests potential for larger data writes, but remains inactive. The code is straightforward and intended for testing purposes. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The main concern is resource exhaustion risk, which is not malicious but could impact performance in resource-constrained environments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary risk is resource exhaustion due to large static data, which is consistent with testing or stress-testing scenarios. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, aligning with the analysis.",
