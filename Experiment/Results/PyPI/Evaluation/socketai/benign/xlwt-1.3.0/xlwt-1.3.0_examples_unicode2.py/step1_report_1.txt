  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file containing Unicode characters, including Greek letters, emojis, and surrogate pairs.",
  "sources": "The code reads static Unicode code points; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to an Excel file named 'unicode2.xls'. No untrusted sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static Unicode code points are converted to characters and written directly to the Excel sheet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of surrogate pairs is standard for Unicode handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'xlwt' library to create an Excel file. It constructs a worksheet with a specific name containing Greek letters and a heart symbol. It sets font size and style, then writes Unicode characters across a range of code points, including surrogate ranges, to the sheet. It saves the file locally. No input or external data sources are used, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating an Excel sheet with various Unicode characters, including surrogates. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
