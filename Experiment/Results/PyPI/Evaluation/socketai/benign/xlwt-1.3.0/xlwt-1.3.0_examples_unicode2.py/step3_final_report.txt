  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file containing a range of Unicode characters, including Greek letters, emojis, Cyrillic, and surrogate pairs, for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static Unicode code points within specified ranges; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing Unicode characters into an Excel file named 'unicode2.xls'.",
  "flows": "Iterates over Unicode ranges, writing characters or placeholders ('Surrogate') into cells, then saves the file.",
  "anomalies": "Handling surrogate code points by writing 'Surrogate' string; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a Unicode test sheet with safe handling of surrogate code points by substituting a placeholder. It does not accept external input, perform network operations, or include any suspicious or malicious code. The surrogate handling is for demonstration and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or credentials are involved. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign Unicode character generator intended for testing or demonstration. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The surrogate handling is explicitly managed and safe. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The code's purpose is clear, and no issues are present.",
