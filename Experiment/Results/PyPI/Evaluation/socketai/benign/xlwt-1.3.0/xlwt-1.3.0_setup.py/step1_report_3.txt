  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the xlwt Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading __VERSION__ from xlwt module; reading 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is being used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from __VERSION__; reading README content; passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.rst' without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools, retrieves version info from xlwt, and reads the README file for long description. The setup() call includes standard package metadata and configuration. There are no indications of malicious code such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is the unguarded open() call, but it is common practice in setup scripts and does not pose a security risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
