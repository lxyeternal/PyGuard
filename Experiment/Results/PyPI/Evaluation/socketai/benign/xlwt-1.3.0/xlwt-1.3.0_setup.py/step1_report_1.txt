  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the xlwt Python package including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from __VERSION__, reading the README.rst file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to potentially vulnerable points.",
  "flows": "Version import -> setup() parameters -> reading README.rst -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It imports __VERSION__ from a third-party library, uses os.path to read a README file, and calls setup() with metadata. All actions are typical and standard for Python package distribution. No data is read from untrusted sources, and there are no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code does not include network activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
