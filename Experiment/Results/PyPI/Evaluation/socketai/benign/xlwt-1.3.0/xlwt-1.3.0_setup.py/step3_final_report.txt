  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the xlwt Python library, defining package metadata and reading the README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading __VERSION__ from xlwt, reading README.rst file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no code execution or data leaks",
  "flows": "Importing version info, reading README, passing metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without explicit encoding or exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It imports version info, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of open() without explicit encoding is common in such scripts and does not introduce security risks. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess this, and the scores are justified and consistent with the code behavior.",
