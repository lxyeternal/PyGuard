  "purpose": "Create an Excel workbook with 7 sheets, populate each with sequential data, and configure pane and split settings for layout presentation.",
  "sources": "Static data written to sheets; fixed numeric values for pane and split configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks; no network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses straightforward API calls with fixed values, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an Excel file with multiple sheets, populates them with sequential integers, and sets various pane and split configurations using fixed numeric values. It employs only the 'xlwt' library, with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The operations are standard for report formatting. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose appears solely for layout presentation, with no data leakage or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and intended for generating styled Excel reports. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are all appropriately zero.",
