  "purpose": "Generate an Excel spreadsheet with multiple sheets and frozen or split panes configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads do not involve untrusted input; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The output file 'panes2.xls' is written to disk.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static code to file output; no untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of hardcoded values appears to be for layout purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a workbook with seven sheets, each with specific frozen or split pane configurations. The code uses static values and the xlwt library to generate an Excel file. No input validation, environment variables, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be straightforward layout configuration for an Excel report or document. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script generating a formatted Excel file with multiple sheets and specific pane configurations. It does not contain malicious or suspicious activity. The script’s purpose appears purely to produce a structured Excel document.",
