  "purpose": "Create an Excel workbook with multiple sheets and set various pane and split configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading static values and defining sheet configurations; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Saving the Excel file 'panes2.xls' to disk.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data flows into sheet and pane settings, culminating in saving the file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, and no dynamic code execution. The code solely manipulates Excel sheet view configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library 'xlwt' for writing Excel files, creates a workbook with multiple sheets, writes static data to each sheet, and configures pane and split positions with various static values. All operations are related to formatting and layout. No external data inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive information handling are present. The code's purpose appears to be straightforward generation of a styled Excel file without any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, focused on creating and configuring Excel sheets with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard usage of the 'xlwt' library for report or data presentation purposes.",
