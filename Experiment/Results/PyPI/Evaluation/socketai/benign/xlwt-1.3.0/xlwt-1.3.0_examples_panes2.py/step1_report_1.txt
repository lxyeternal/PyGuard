  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file with multiple sheets and frozen or split panes configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading hardcoded sheet names, writing data to sheets, setting properties for panes and splits.",
  "sinks": "Saving the workbook to 'panes2.xls', no untrusted data sources or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "No external data flows or untrusted input processing; only internal data manipulation and file saving.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all operations are standard for Excel file generation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a workbook with 7 sheets, populates them with sequential data, and sets various pane and split configurations. The code uses fixed numeric values and properties to configure worksheet view settings. No external data inputs, user inputs, or untrusted sources are involved. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or contain any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward Excel file generator with pane and split settings, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
