{
  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file with multiple formulas using the xlwt library",
  "sources": "Input data is hardcoded within the script and formulas are written directly as strings in code",
  "sinks": "The formulas are written into an Excel sheet; no external data sinks or network interactions present",
  "flows": "The script writes formulas directly into an Excel file, which will be computed by Excel upon opening; no data flow outside the file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; formulas are standard Excel expressions, no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports xlwt, creates a workbook and sheet, then writes various formulas into cells, including basic arithmetic, functions, and constants. The formulas are straightforward and typical for spreadsheet calculations. There are comments indicating parameter separation with semicolons, consistent with Excel formula syntax. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are used. The formulas include simple calculations, functions like SUM, and string concatenations, all standard in Excel. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for generating an Excel file with pre-defined formulas. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malware. The formulas are standard and the code structure is straightforward.",
