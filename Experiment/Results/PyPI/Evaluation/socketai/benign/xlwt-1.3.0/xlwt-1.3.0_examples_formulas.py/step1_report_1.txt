{
  "purpose": "Generate an Excel spreadsheet with various formulas using the xlwt library.",
  "sources": "Data read occurs when formulas reference other cells (e.g., A1, B1, C1) and functions like now().",
  "sinks": "Formulas are written into the spreadsheet; no direct data leakage or external output actions are present.",
  "flows": "Formulas referencing cells and functions derive calculations; no external data flows or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of formulas with functions like now(), and complex nested formulas, but these are typical for spreadsheet generation. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script creates an Excel file with multiple formulas, including basic arithmetic, functions, and references. There are no signs of code injection, external communication, or malicious logic. The use of formulas is consistent with spreadsheet data manipulation. No obfuscation or hidden code elements are present. The comments and code structure are straightforward and related to spreadsheet formula creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard script for generating a spreadsheet with formulas. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code; it simply automates formula entry.",
