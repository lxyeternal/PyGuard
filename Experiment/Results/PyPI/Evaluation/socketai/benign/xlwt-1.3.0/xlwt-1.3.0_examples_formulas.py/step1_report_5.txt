{
  "purpose": "Generate an Excel file with predefined formulas using the xlwt library.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; the code uses hardcoded formulas and strings.",
  "sinks": "Formulas are written into an Excel sheet; potential risks include formula injection if formulas are constructed from untrusted input (not applicable here).",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to sinks; the code simply writes static formulas into the spreadsheet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of formulas that include references to other cells, functions, and string literals; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the xlwt library to create an Excel workbook and sheet. It writes multiple formulas into the sheet, including basic arithmetic, functions, and string concatenations. No external input is processed, and no data is fetched from external sources. The formulas appear to be for mathematical or illustrative purposes. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious commands. The code’s purpose is clearly to generate an Excel file with formulas, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for generating an Excel file with formulas. It does not contain malware or security risks. The logic is straightforward, and there are no anomalies or suspicious activities.",
