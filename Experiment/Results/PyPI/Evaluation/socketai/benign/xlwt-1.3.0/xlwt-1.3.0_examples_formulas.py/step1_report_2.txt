{
  "purpose": "Generate an Excel spreadsheet with predefined formulas using the xlwt library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from static formulas written directly into the code; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The formulas written into Excel cells, which are standard Excel formulas; no data is transmitted or executed outside the scope of formula writing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; formulas are static strings written into cells.",
  "anomalies": "Use of formula syntax with semicolons as parameter separators; inclusion of cell references, mathematical functions, and string literals. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports xlwt, a library for writing Excel files, and creates a workbook with a sheet named 'F'. It writes multiple formulas into the sheet, including basic arithmetic, references to other cells, functions like SUM, SIN, NOW(), and string concatenation. The formulas use standard Excel syntax, with some localized (semicolon-separated) parameters. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data sources, or external network calls. The formulas themselves are typical for spreadsheet calculations. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears solely to generate a spreadsheet with formulas.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign Excel formula generator using the xlwt library. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. The formulas are standard and static, and there are no external data or command execution points.",
