  "purpose": "Create an Excel spreadsheet with styled rows containing the text 'Test'",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; primarily uses internal range for iteration",
  "sinks": "Writes an Excel file named 'row_styles.xls' to the filesystem",
  "flows": "Iteration over range(6, 80) to generate styles and write to sheet, then saves file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library 'xlwt' to generate an Excel file. It creates a workbook and a sheet named 'Hey, Dude'. It then iterates from 6 to 79, setting row height dynamically and writing the string 'Test' into the second column of each row, applying styles with increasing height. The final step saves the file as 'row_styles.xls'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward and appears solely for generating a styled Excel sheet.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be benign, intended for creating a styled Excel file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
