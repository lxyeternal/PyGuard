  "purpose": "Create an Excel spreadsheet with styled rows containing the text 'Test'",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code",
  "sinks": "Writing an Excel file 'row_styles.xls' locally",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data flows from code to file system",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard use of xlwt library",
  "analysis": "The code imports xlwt, creates a workbook and a sheet, then iterates from 6 to 79 to style each row's font size and write 'Test' in the second column. The styling is dynamically generated based on the loop index, but no external inputs, no network activity, and no malicious code are present. The script simply generates a styled Excel file with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs benign creation of a styled Excel file without any malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a straightforward use of the xlwt library to generate a spreadsheet.",
