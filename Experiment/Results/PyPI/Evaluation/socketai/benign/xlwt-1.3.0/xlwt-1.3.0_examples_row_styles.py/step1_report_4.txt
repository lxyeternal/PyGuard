  "purpose": "Create an Excel file with styled rows containing the text 'Test'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code writes an Excel file named 'row_styles.xls' locally.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a non-standard character encoding declaration; no suspicious or obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'xlwt' library to generate an Excel spreadsheet. It creates a workbook and adds a sheet named 'Hey, Dude'. It then iterates from 6 to 79, setting font size dynamically and applying styles to each row, writing the string 'Test' into the second column of each row. The font size increases with each iteration, and styles are set per row. The code writes the styled data to a local file 'row_styles.xls'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. It is straightforward and intended for report or data formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to generate a styled Excel spreadsheet. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
