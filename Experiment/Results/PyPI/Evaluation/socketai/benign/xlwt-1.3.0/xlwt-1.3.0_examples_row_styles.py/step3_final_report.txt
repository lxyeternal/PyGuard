  "purpose": "Generate a styled Excel spreadsheet with rows having increasing font sizes, writing 'Test' in each row.",
  "sources": "Internal variables for loop index, font size, and style; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "File system where 'row_styles.xls' is saved; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Loop variable 'i' determines font size; style applied to each row; data written directly to the sheet; file saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'xlwt', creates a workbook and sheet, iterates from 6 to 79, setting font height proportional to the index, applies styles, writes 'Test' into each row, and saves the file. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious code segments are present. The code performs a benign task of generating a styled Excel file. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe script for creating a styled Excel file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
