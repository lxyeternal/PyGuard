{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module that sets up logging, imports custom exceptions and a parser function, and specifies module metadata and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .exceptions and .parser",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between sources and sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module setup: setting logging configuration, importing functions and classes, and defining metadata variables. It imports local modules for exceptions and parsing functions, which are standard practices. The logging configuration uses NullHandler, which is safe and common to prevent logging propagation. No user input, external data sources, or suspicious operations are present. The code does not execute any dynamic code, network operations, or file manipulations. Overall, this appears to be boilerplate module setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It serves to configure logging and expose functions and exceptions, which is typical in Python packages.",
