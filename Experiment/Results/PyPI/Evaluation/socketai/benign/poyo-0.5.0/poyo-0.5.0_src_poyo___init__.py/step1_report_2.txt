{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a package that provides a string parsing utility and custom exception handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports internal modules and sets up logging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and only includes standard setup and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and internal modules, sets up a null logger handler, defines package metadata, and exposes two components for external use. There are no signs of suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or module setup, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for a package initialization or interface module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
