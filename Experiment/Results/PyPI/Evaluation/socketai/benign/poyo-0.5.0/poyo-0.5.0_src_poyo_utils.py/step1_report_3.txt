{
  "purpose": "Read and return the contents of a UTF-8 encoded file",
  "sources": "File input via the 'file_path' parameter, read using codecs.open()",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs file contents; no direct sink of untrusted data into external systems",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'file_path' to codecs.open(), then reading the file content, then returning the data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to read a file with UTF-8 encoding and return its contents. It uses codecs.open() to handle encoding explicitly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and standard for file reading. It does not appear to perform any malicious or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for reading UTF-8 text files. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
