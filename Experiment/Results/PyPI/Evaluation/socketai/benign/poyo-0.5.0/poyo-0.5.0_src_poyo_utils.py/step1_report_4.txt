{
  "purpose": "Read a Unicode-encoded file from a specified file path",
  "sources": "The function reads data from a file path provided as input parameter 'file_path'",
  "sinks": "The code returns the entire contents of the file, which could potentially be untrusted data if the file contents are malicious",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' flows into 'codecs.open', then the file content flows into the return statement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to read a UTF-8 encoded file. It uses 'codecs.open' to open the file, which is a standard approach for handling different encodings. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no network activity, no data exfiltration, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and legitimate for reading files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file reading function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input from the filesystem and returns content, which is a common and benign operation.",
