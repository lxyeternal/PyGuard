  "purpose": "Read the contents of a UTF-8 encoded file",
  "sources": "Reading from a file specified by 'file_path'",
  "sinks": "Returning file content; no external output or network operations",
  "flows": "Input (file_path) -> read_unicode_file() -> return file contents",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The function opens a file with the specified path using codecs.open with UTF-8 encoding and returns its contents. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code execution observed. Usage of codecs.open is standard for handling Unicode files. No obfuscation or unusual language features present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for reading Unicode files, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
