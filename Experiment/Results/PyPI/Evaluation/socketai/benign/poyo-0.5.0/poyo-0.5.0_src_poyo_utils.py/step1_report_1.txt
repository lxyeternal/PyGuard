  "purpose": "Read the contents of a file with UTF-8 encoding",
  "sources": "File path input to read_unicode_file function",
  "sinks": "Returning the file contents; no direct sink that leads to external effect or data leak",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'file_path' -> codecs.open() -> return file content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to read a file with UTF-8 encoding using the codecs module. It takes a file path as input, opens the file, reads its contents, and returns it. There are no suspicious patterns, external network calls, or malicious behaviors present. The code performs a straightforward file read operation without any side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility function for reading a UTF-8 encoded file with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
