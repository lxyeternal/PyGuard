  "purpose": "A simple utility function to read the contents of a UTF-8 encoded file.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from a file specified by 'file_path' using codecs.open() with UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the file contents; potential issues could arise if the file contains malicious data, but the code itself does not process untrusted input further.",
  "flows": "Input: file_path -> codecs.open() -> read() -> return contents",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward file read operation with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that opens a file with UTF-8 encoding, reads its contents, and returns it. It uses standard library functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is benign and performs a common utility task. No anomalies or security issues are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, with full confidence (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for reading UTF-8 encoded files. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or concern is warranted.",
