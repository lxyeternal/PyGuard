  "purpose": "Read a Unicode-encoded file from a specified path",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'file_path' parameter via codecs.open",
  "sinks": "The data read from the file is returned; potential data leakage depends on the context of usage",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'file_path' flows into codecs.open, which reads and returns the file content",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that opens a file with UTF-8 encoding and returns its content. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of codecs.open is standard for reading Unicode files. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file reading utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is typical and safe within the given context.",
