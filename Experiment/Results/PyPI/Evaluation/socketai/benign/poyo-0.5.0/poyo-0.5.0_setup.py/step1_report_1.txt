{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'poyo' Python YAML parser library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, user inputs are not directly read, external dependencies are specified but none are actively used in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration does not process external untrusted inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script primarily defines package metadata and configuration, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code uses standard setup procedures with no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for file handling and packaging (setuptools). It defines a read() function to load README.md content, used in long_description. The setup() call defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and keywords, all typical for a Python package. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or code execution based on external data is present. The code follows conventional packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
