  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'poyo' library, configuring metadata and reading a local README.md file.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic input, network activity, or malicious code. It reads a local file safely and defines package metadata. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with minimal security risk scores. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm the absence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
