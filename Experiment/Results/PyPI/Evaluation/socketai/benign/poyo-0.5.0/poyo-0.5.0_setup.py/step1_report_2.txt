{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'poyo' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via the 'read' function; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup data flows within the setup() call; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The 'read' function correctly reads a local file.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses setuptools for package configuration. The 'read' function constructs a file path and reads 'README.md' content safely with specified encoding. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and keywords, all from static, hardcoded values. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded malicious code is present. The script appears to be a typical, well-structured package setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging with setuptools. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The code is safe and intended for normal package distribution.",
