{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'poyo' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file, importing 'setuptools', environment variables for package info, and current file directory for paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no output to external systems or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into 'long_description'; package setup data flows into setuptools for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious code, hidden logic, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function to read a file's content. It then calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, URLs, licensing, package discovery, and classifiers. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and metadata declaration.",
