{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'poyo' with its metadata and configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and reads package files from the 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or external system manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content as input; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup routines: reading a README file for description and configuring package metadata. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of 'setuptools' for package configuration and the absence of dynamic code execution, network calls, or secret handling indicates a benign purpose. The code strictly manages package metadata and dependencies, which is typical for open-source Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
