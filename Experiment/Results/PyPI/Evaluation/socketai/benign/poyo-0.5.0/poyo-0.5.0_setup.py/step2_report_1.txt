  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- No dynamic input, network activity, or code execution based on external data.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is a typical setup script; nothing suspicious or malicious is present.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior, the risk score should be very low, possibly 0 or near-zero.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code reads a local file (`README.md`) safely.\n- Uses static package metadata.\n- No untrusted input handling, no code injection, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n### Evaluation of individual reports:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the benign code.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the script performs only package setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores reflect this correctly.",
