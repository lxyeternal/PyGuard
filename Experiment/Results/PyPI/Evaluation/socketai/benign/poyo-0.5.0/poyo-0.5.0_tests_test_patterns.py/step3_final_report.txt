  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying regex patterns for parsing YAML-like syntax.",
  "sources": "Static string inputs within test functions used for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or leads to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching on static inputs without data flow to other systems or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward regex validation with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static regex pattern tests with no dynamic data, no external interactions, and no code execution. All patterns are used solely for validation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The tests are well-structured and rely on static inputs, indicating a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with this assessment. The confidence in this conclusion is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for regex patterns in a YAML parser. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current low scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
