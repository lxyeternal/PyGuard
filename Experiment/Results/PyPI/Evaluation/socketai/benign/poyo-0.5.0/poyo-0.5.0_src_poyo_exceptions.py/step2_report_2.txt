  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Poyo parser library.\n   - Each class inherits from `PoyoException`, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The classes are:\n     - `NoMatchException`\n     - `NoParentException`\n     - `NoTypeException`\n     - `IgnoredMatchException`\n   - All classes contain descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose.\n   - There are no data input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely definitional; it does not process data, handle external inputs, or perform any operations beyond class declarations.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The exception classes are common in Python projects and serve as a structured error handling mechanism.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They consistently note the absence of external data handling, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The purpose of these exception classes is typical and does not introduce any security concern.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n   - No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are needed.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the step-by-step review, the code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security risks or malware indicators. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the actual risk level.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
