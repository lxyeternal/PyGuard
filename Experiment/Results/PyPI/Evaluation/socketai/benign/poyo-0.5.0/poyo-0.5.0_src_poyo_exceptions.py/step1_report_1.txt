{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Poyo parser library, serving as a structured error handling mechanism.",
  "sources": "No external data input or environment variables are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from input to output, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; code consists solely of class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. Each class has a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no data input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for error handling in a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling within the Poyo parser library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a normal, safe component of a larger codebase.",
