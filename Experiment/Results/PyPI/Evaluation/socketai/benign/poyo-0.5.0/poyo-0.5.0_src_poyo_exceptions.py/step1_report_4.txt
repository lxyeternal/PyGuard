  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Poyo parsing library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception class definitions do not read or process data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class includes a descriptive docstring. There are no input operations, data processing, or external communications. The code serves as a foundation for error handling within the Poyo parser. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment consists solely of exception class declarations meant for structured error handling in a parser library. It contains no malicious code, no data leakage, and no security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
