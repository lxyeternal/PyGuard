  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling within the Poyo parser library.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No network activity, data processing, or external dependencies.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for a Python library's exception handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they recognize the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n5. **Any Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the code's nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions for exceptions, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, and no changes to the scores or conclusions are needed.",
