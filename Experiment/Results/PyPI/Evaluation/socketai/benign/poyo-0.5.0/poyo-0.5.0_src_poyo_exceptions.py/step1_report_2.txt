  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various parsing errors in a program called Poyo.",
  "sources": "No input sources, data reading, or external input handling present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception class. These are standard, straightforward class definitions with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or other suspicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network operations, or any other security concerns in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional for exception handling and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
