  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no data input/output operations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any form of obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in a Python library.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, code injection, or external data handling.\n   - No suspicious constructs or obfuscation.\n   - The purpose is purely to define exception classes, which is a common pattern.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), and all indicate zero malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n   - The reasoning is consistent across reports, emphasizing the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero risk/malware/obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**\n   - No. The code is purely definitional, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is just class definitions, it cannot execute malicious behavior on its own.\n   - The reports correctly identify the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in a parser library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of this code snippet.",
