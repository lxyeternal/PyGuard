  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nThe code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`, each with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in a Python library.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.  \n- No external data handling, environment variable usage, or network activity is present.  \n- No signs of malware, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:  \nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe, with a confidence level of 1. They identify that the code solely defines exception classes for error handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation**:  \n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as purely definitional.  \n- The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**  \n- Given the nature of the code, there is no basis for increasing the risk, malware, or obfuscation scores.  \n- The code is not complex or suspicious enough to warrant concern.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:  \n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.  \n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0  \n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a safe, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
