{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Poyo parser library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their docstrings; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, with no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The classes serve as structured error types for the library. No malicious, suspicious, or insecure constructs are present. The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
