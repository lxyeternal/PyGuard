  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a parser or processing library related to 'Poyo'.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data sources in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or data handling actions in this snippet).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception. These classes are used for error handling within a parser or similar system. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception hierarchy with descriptive docstrings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a parsing context. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
