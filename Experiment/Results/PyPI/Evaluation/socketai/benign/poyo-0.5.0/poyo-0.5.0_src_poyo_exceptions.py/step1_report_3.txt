  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a parser system related to Poyo.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward class inheritance without unusual patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for a parser, each with a descriptive docstring. There are no external data reads, no use of environment variables, network calls, or other potentially malicious operations. The structure is simple and typical for exception handling. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a larger parsing library, with no signs of obfuscation, data leakage, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, safe, and does not pose any threats.",
