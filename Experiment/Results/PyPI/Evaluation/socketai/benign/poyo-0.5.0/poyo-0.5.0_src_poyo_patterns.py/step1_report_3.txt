{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define regular expression patterns and compile them for parsing structured text data, possibly YAML-like or configuration files.",
  "sources": "The code reads static pattern definitions from string literals within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent data sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond pattern compilation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code only compiles regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive regex pattern definitions but no executable logic or data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or command execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines and compiles regular expressions for parsing text data structures. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected. There is no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. It is purely static pattern setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a static set of regex definitions for parsing configuration-like files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is benign and intended for data parsing.",
