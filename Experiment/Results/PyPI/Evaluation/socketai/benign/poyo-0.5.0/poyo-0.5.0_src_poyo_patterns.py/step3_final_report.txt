  "purpose": "Define and compile regex patterns for parsing structured text files, likely YAML-like configurations.",
  "sources": "Pattern strings for comments, sections, key-value pairs, lists, multiline strings, and data types.",
  "sinks": "Compilation of regex patterns; no data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Pattern strings are compiled into regex objects; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward regex pattern definitions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string definitions for regex patterns, compiled into regex objects for later use. It does not process input, execute code, or interact with external systems. The patterns cover comments, sections, key-value pairs, lists, multiline strings, and data types, serving as a static setup for parsing configuration files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of regex pattern definitions intended for parsing structured text files. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and should be maintained.",
