{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and hooks for modifying Python test files based on test outcomes, specifically for updating assertions and handling exceptions during pytest runs.",
  "sources": "Reads test file content using file_read(), extracts function code blocks with python_function_blocks(), and processes report text from pytest hook rep.longreprtext.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified test content back to files using file_write(). No other data sinks or external data transmission is evident.",
  "flows": "Reads test files -> modifies function code blocks -> updates test files via file_write() based on pytest report outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded strings are related to test assertions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are observed. The code is designed to automate test updates, not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with test files and pytest reports, updating assertions dynamically based on test results. It uses straightforward string manipulations and file I/O functions. No obfuscated language features, suspicious external network calls, or covert data exfiltration methods are present. The functions are dedicated to test management and do not exhibit malicious intent. The presence of print statements and hooks does not imply malicious behavior, rather standard pytest plugin usage. Overall, the code is benign, focused on test automation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard test automation utility for pytest, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It solely manipulates test files and handles test report data without performing any harmful operations.",
