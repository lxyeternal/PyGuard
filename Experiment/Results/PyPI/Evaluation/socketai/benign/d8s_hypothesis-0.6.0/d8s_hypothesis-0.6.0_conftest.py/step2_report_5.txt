  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for modifying pytest test files based on outcomes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads files, modifies function blocks, writes back.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; straightforward string manipulations; no external network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely test automation.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar test update utility, manages assertions and exceptions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads, modifies, writes test files; hooks into pytest.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; relies on string replacements; global variables are used but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe test automation utility.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (minimal, related to file modifications, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focuses on updating assertions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads, updates, writes test files.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns; uses standard string manipulations.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign test utility.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (similar reasoning as above)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar test file modifications based on pytest reports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads, updates, writes files.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No external network activity; dynamic modifications could be misused if test files are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard test automation.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (related to potential misuse, but not malicious per se)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—automated test file updates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads, modifies, writes files.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard string manipulations.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe a set of utility functions and pytest hooks for automating test assertion updates based on test outcomes.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only concern is the dynamic modification of source files, which could be misused if test files are malicious or tampered with. However, the code itself does not contain any malicious logic, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The reported scores are mostly 0.2 or 0, which seem reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, related to file modifications, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign test automation utility with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The existing scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the ability to modify source files dynamically, which could be exploited if test files are untrusted. However, this is a common pattern in test automation and does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential for misuse but not malicious intent)",
