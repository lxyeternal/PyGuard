  "purpose": "Utility functions and pytest hooks for updating test assertions and exception handling in test files based on pytest outcomes.",
  "sources": "Reads test files via file_read(), parses function blocks, and extracts report text for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified test files back via file_write(), updating assertion lines or exception handling code.",
  "flows": "Reads source code, identifies target function blocks, replaces assertion or exception code, and writes back updated files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; standard string manipulations; use of global variables is benign; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test automation for updating assertions based on pytest results. It manipulates source files through string operations, hooks into pytest reporting, and performs controlled modifications. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, acknowledging the potential risk of dynamic source modification but not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest utility for automating test assertion updates. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slight security risk score reflects the potential misuse of source code modification, but overall, it is a safe and controlled utility.",
