  "purpose": "Utility function to generate multiple results from a Hypothesis strategy for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for strategy and arguments; uses Hypothesis decorators to generate data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Strategy input -> decorated method -> Hypothesis generates data -> appends to list -> returns list.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of defining a class inside a function with decorated method, but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates an inner class with a method decorated with @given and @settings. When invoked, Hypothesis runs the method multiple times, collecting generated data into a list. No external side effects, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is unconventional but benign, serving as a utility for data generation in testing. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating multiple hypothesis test samples. It does not perform any malicious actions or security-compromising operations. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 (due to unconventional pattern but no actual risk). Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
