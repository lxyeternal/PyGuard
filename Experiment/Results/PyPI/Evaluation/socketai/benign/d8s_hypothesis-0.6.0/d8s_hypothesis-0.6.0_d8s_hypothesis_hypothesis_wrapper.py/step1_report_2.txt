  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating and collecting results from hypothesis strategies for testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from the hypothesis library, particularly the 'strategy' argument and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the code does not send data over network, write to disk, or invoke untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Input strategy and arguments flow into the 'given' decorator, which generates data used in the function, and results are stored in a list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that uses hypothesis testing strategies to generate data. It creates an inner class with a method decorated with hypothesis 'given' and 'settings' to generate and collect test values. The flow appears to be standard for hypothesis-based testing, with no apparent malicious behavior. No data is transmitted externally or stored insecurely. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for hypothesis testing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
