{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading static files for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements_dev.txt' files at setup time.",
  "sinks": "Passes collected data into setuptools.setup() without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> passes content to setup() -> completes package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py that reads static files for package metadata and dependencies, then invokes setuptools.setup() with this data. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. All signals point to a benign, standard packaging process. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. External files are static and controlled, and the code adheres to common practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are consistent and correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the analysis.",
