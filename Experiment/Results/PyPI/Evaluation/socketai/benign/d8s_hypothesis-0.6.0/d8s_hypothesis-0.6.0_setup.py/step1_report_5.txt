  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'd8s_hypothesis' that includes package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements_dev.txt' to gather package description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, as the script primarily reads files and calls setup functions; no network or system modifications are made.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and dependencies from files, then passes them to 'setup()' without any data manipulation or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard 'setuptools' setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup procedure: reading documentation and dependency files, then invoking 'setup()' with collected data. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
