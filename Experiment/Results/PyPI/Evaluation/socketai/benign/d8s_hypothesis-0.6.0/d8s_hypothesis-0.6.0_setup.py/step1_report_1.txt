{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'd8s_hypothesis' that manages package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements_dev.txt' files to gather package description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data sources are from static files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables, then into the setup() function parameters for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code strictly adheres to standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package description and requirements from static files and invokes setuptools.setup() with these parameters. No untrusted input is processed at runtime; all inputs are from local files. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and follows common Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It safely reads static files and uses setuptools to configure the package. No security risks are identified.",
