  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'd8s_hypothesis', facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements_dev.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external influence are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables, which are then used to configure the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads package descriptions and requirements from files, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. All operations are typical for package configuration. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It reads necessary configuration data and prepares the package for distribution securely.",
