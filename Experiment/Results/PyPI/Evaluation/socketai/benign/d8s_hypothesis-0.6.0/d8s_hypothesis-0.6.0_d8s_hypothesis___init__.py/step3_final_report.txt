  "purpose": "Package metadata and local import of hypothesis_wrapper module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .hypothesis_wrapper, static metadata assignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows",
  "flows": "Import statement is static; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols; no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module, sets static metadata. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The use of 'import *' is discouraged as it can hide malicious or unintended code, but in this context, it appears to be a standard practice. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest low risk. The main concern is the potential for compromised modules in supply chain, but no evidence supports this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Given the evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect the potential risk associated with wildcard imports, but overall, the code is safe.",
