  "purpose": "Module metadata and import statement for hypothesis_wrapper",
  "sources": "Importing all from .hypothesis_wrapper module, reading metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data processing or output functions detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata assignments and import",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code within the module, though no direct malicious code is present here",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata variables and imports all symbols from a local module. The import statement 'from .hypothesis_wrapper import *' can be considered a risk if the imported module contains malicious code, but within this snippet, no such code is visible. The metadata variables are static strings with no sensitive data or secrets. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no immediate signs of malicious intent. The only potential concern is the use of 'import *', which could obscure malicious code if present in the imported module. However, based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
