{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports a module named 'hypothesis_wrapper'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .hypothesis_wrapper import *' and package metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "The import could potentially load code from 'hypothesis_wrapper', but without seeing that module, no flow can be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import may obscure actual source code location; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns in metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata variables and imports a module. The import statement uses a wildcard, which can sometimes mask imported contents, but without additional context, it is standard practice in modular Python packages. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are evident in this snippet. The metadata provided appears normal for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, setting package metadata and importing a module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
