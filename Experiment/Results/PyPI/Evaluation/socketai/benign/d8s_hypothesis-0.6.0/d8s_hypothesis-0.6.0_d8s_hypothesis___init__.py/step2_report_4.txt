  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Findings:* No issues; straightforward package metadata and local import.\n- *Logic:* Correct; no external data flow, no anomalies.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Findings:* Importing all from a local module, static metadata.\n- *Logic:* Use of 'import *' is poor practice but not malicious.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — possibly slightly high for risk; perhaps 0.1 is more appropriate.\n- *Conclusion:* No malicious activity; the risk score could be lowered slightly.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Findings:* Similar to above, with emphasis on potential risk from 'import *'.\n- *Logic:* Same as above; no malicious code shown.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0.2 seems sufficient.\n- *Conclusion:* No evidence of malicious activity; the risk score could be reduced.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Findings:* Wildcard import is a potential concern if the module is compromised.\n- *Logic:* The concern about risk from compromised modules is valid, but no actual malicious code is present.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3 — perhaps slightly high, but justified if considering supply chain risk.\n- *Conclusion:* The risk score is reasonable given the potential for compromised modules, but no direct malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Findings:* Similar to others; no signs of malicious code.\n- *Logic:* Correct; standard package initialization.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- *Conclusion:* No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Most are very low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the fact that the only concern is the use of 'import *', which is a known bad practice but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- For reports highlighting the 'import *' concern, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2) could be justified, especially if considering supply chain risks.\n- The highest risk score assigned (0.3) is acceptable but could be marginally reduced if no evidence of compromised modules exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** Given the use of 'import *' and potential supply chain issues, a conservative estimate would be around **0.1 to 0.2**. Since no malicious code is present, 0.1 is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (slightly above the lowest, acknowledging potential risks from wildcard imports but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears benign, with the main concern being the use of 'import *', which can obscure imported content and potentially introduce risks if the imported module is compromised. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present.",
