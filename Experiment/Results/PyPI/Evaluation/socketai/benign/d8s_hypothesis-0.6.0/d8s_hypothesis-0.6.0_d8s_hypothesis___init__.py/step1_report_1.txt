  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports functionality from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .hypothesis_wrapper",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Import statement imports from a local module, no data flow from external untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; metadata appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module from the same package directory, sets version, author, and email metadata. The import is local and does not involve external data or untrusted input. The metadata fields are static strings. There is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve a standard purpose of package information setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata and import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
