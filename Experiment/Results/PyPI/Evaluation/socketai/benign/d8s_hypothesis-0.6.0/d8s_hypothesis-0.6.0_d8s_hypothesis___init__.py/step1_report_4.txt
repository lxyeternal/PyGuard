  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import a module from the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .hypothesis_wrapper import *",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis beyond import statement; no untrusted data sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported content and potentially introduce malicious code if the module is compromised",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) and imports everything from a local module 'hypothesis_wrapper'. The wildcard import can potentially import malicious or unintended code if the 'hypothesis_wrapper' module has been tampered with or maliciously modified. No other suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The import statement is standard but can be risky if the imported module is compromised or intentionally malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are immediately apparent from the provided code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks with an import statement that could pose a risk if the imported module is malicious or compromised. No direct malicious behavior or malicious code is visible in this snippet, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution.",
