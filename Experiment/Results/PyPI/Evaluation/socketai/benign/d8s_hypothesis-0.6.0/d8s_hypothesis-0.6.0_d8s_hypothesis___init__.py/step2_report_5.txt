  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .hypothesis_wrapper import *\n\n__version__ = '0.6.0'\n__author__ = '''Floyd Hightower'''\n__email__ = 'floyd.hightower27@gmail.com'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Straightforward package metadata + local import; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as local, static metadata, no untrusted data.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on 'import *' being poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that 'import *' can hide imported symbols, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; main concern is the practice of 'import *'.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated due to 'import *')\n\n**Assessment:** Fair. The concern about 'import *' is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar, with focus on potential risk if 'hypothesis_wrapper' is compromised.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that 'import *' can obscure malicious code if the module is compromised, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** No immediate signs of malicious intent; 'import *' is a potential risk but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Highlights the potential risk of 'import *' if the module is malicious or compromised.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that if 'hypothesis_wrapper' is malicious, the import could bring in malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code visible, but the wildcard import warrants caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.3 (elevated due to potential risk)\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The risk is theoretical but not confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing that the code is standard and no malicious behavior is visible.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import is from a local module, with no signs of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No indication of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The main concern across multiple reports is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in the provided snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, and given the code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward. No obfuscation detected. **Obfuscated score should remain 0.**\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nWhile the reports assign low to moderate risk (up to 0.3), this is primarily due to the potential risk if the imported module is malicious. Since we have no evidence of compromise or malicious code, the risk should be minimal. A reasonable score would be **around 0.1** to reflect the potential concern but lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Recommendation |\n|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                    |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                  |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard package metadata with a local import. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but does not constitute malicious behavior on its own. No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation. The potential risk hinges on the integrity of the 'hypothesis_wrapper' module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the integrity of imported modules, especially when using wildcard imports, to mitigate supply chain risks.",
