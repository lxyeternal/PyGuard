  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Given the evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect the potential risk associated with wildcard imports, but overall, the code is safe."
