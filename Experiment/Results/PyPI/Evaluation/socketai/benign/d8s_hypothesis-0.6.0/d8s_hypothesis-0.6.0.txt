The slight security risk score reflects the potential misuse of source code modification, but overall, it is a safe and controlled utility."

The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 (due to unconventional pattern but no actual risk). Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. Given the evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect the potential risk associated with wildcard imports, but overall, the code is safe."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk, except for Report 4, which exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic code features. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for Report 4 aligns better with its suspicious characteristics. Overall, the dependency is low risk, with some caution advised for obfuscated code patterns."
