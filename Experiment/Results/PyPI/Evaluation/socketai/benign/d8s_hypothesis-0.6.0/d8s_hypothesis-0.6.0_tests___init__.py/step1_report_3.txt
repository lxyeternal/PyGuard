  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script that performs some form of data processing or functionality, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, imported modules, or external files if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, subprocess calls, or data serialization/deserialization points.",
  "flows": "The data flow would typically involve input sources being processed and then sent to sinks, possibly via intermediate functions or data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without seeing the actual code. Look for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual function calls that deviate from normal patterns.",
  "analysis": "Since no code was provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Typically, this involves reviewing import statements for suspicious libraries, checking for hardcoded secrets, analyzing data handling functions for unsafe operations, and inspecting external communications for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine the presence of malicious behavior due to lack of code. No specific malicious indicators are observable without actual code content. The overall risk appears low but cannot be confirmed without further details.",
