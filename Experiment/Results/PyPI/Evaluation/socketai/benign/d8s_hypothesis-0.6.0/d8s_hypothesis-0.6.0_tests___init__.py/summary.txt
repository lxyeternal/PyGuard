  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk, except for Report 4, which exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic code features. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for Report 4 aligns better with its suspicious characteristics. Overall, the dependency is low risk, with some caution advised for obfuscated code patterns."
