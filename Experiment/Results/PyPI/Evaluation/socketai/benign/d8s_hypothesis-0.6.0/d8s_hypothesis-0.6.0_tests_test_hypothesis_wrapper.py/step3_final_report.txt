  "purpose": "Testing IP address generation and validation using hypothesis strategies.",
  "sources": "Internal hypothesis modules (`hypothesis.strategies._internal.ipaddress`) for generating IP addresses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Generation of IP addresses via internal hypothesis functions, validation through `is_ip_address`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, non-public hypothesis modules; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate and validate IP addresses using hypothesis. It imports internal modules, which is unconventional but not malicious. The functions perform straightforward IP validation and testing assertions. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code is purely for testing IP address generation correctness. The use of internal modules is fragile but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for IP address generation, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of internal hypothesis modules is unconventional but not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malware or obfuscation is present.",
