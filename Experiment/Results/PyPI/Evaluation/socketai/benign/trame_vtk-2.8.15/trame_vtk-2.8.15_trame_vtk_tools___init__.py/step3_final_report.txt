  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Data processing functions, dynamic code execution points, external network or file interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration, network connections, use of eval/exec, handling of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input sources to dynamic execution or network communication points, possibly via eval or socket calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval or exec, missing or empty code snippets, potential dynamic code execution, but no actual malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity. Dynamic functions are used but deemed standard and safe. The absence of malicious indicators justifies malware=0 and obfuscated=0 scores. Security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting typical concerns with dynamic code and data handling but no active threats. Confidence levels are high where code is present and thorough, lower where code is missing or unclear. Overall, the code appears safe, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
