  "purpose": "Serialize texture objects by extracting input data and properties, and tracking dependencies.",
  "sources": "texture.GetInput(), texture.GetInterpolate(), texture.GetRepeat(), texture.GetEdgeClamp()",
  "sinks": "External functions serialize(), reference_id(), wrap_id() (assumed safe, no data leaks or malicious activity)",
  "flows": "texture.GetInput() -> serialize() -> dependencies; texture properties -> output dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward serialization with optional input check",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple serializer for texture objects, calling standard getter methods and external serialization utilities. It checks for GetInput() method, retrieves input data if available, serializes dependencies, and constructs a structured dictionary with properties and calls. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. External functions are assumed safe; no network or file operations are involved. The code's logic is clear, and the security implications are minimal. The reliance on external functions does not introduce risks given their presumed safety. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward serializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
