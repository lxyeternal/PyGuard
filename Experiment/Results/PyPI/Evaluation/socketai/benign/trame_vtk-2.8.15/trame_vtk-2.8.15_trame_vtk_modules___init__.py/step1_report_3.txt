{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately visible purpose related to malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading data from environment variables, input() functions, or external files (if any); specific sources not explicitly identified due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include executing dynamically constructed code, writing sensitive data to files, or network operations (if present). However, no such sinks are clearly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., file writes, network calls) would be typical, but no explicit flows are observable from the code snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code structure appears straightforward without unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates the code is a plain, standard Python script without signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling. No indications of malicious behaviors like network exfiltration, backdoors, or credential theft are present. Since the code snippet is either missing or minimal, the confidence in detecting malicious activity is limited, but based on available information, there are no red flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
