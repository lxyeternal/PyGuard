  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Confidence levels should be reduced from 0.6–0.8 to approximately 0.2–0.3 to better reflect the lack of concrete evidence. Overall, the assessments are appropriate, and the low risk scores are justified. No significant issues are detected; the dependency appears benign based on available information."
