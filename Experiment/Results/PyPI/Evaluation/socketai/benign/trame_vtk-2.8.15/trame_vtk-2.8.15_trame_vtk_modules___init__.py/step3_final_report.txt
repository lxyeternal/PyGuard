  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on summaries and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No specific untrusted data sources identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observable without code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; reports mention no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the lack of code, leading to conservative assessments. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero across all reports. Confidence scores are slightly high in some cases (up to 0.8), but given the absence of code, they should be lowered to around 0.2-0.3 to reflect uncertainty. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), consistent with minimal evidence. The reasoning in each report is cautious and reasonable, with no unwarranted risk claims. Adjusting confidence downward enhances accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Confidence levels should be reduced from 0.6–0.8 to approximately 0.2–0.3 to better reflect the lack of concrete evidence. Overall, the assessments are appropriate, and the low risk scores are justified. No significant issues are detected; the dependency appears benign based on available information.",
