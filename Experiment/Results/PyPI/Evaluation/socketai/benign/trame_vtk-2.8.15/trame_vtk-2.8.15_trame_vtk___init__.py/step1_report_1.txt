{
  "purpose": "To retrieve version information of the 'trame-vtk' package and generate a reference ID from a given object.",
  "sources": "get_version function from 'trame_client.utils.version', the ref parameter passed to reference_id()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code primarily processes data internally without external output or data transmission.",
  "flows": "get_version() retrieves version info; reference_id() extracts or formats an ID from ref, with fallback handling",
  "anomalies": "The exception handling in reference_id() is generic, but no malicious activity is evident. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function to get version info and defines a function to generate an ID from an object, with a fallback. No external network or data leaks are apparent. The try-except block captures all exceptions but is used for internal processing. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and intended for versioning and reference ID generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version retrieval and ID extraction without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
