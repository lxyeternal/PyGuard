  "purpose": "Manage visualization views, camera controls, animations, and scene updates via external app and helper objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (camera, new_view), external helper and app objects for state and protocol calls.",
  "sinks": "Protocol calls (e.g., 'viewport.image.push.quality', 'viewport.image.animation.start/stop'), state updates (self._app.state).",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> helper methods or protocol calls -> state updates or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class managing visualization views, triggering external commands, and updating state. It does not perform any unsafe operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. External inputs are passed to helper methods or protocol calls, which could be risky if untrusted, but the code itself remains benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on external systems, but the code structure itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization control class with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, assuming external inputs are validated. All reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.",
