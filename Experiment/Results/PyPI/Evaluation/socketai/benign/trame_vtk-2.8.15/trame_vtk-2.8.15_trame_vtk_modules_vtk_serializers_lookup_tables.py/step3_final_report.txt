  "purpose": "Serialization of VTK lookup tables and color transfer functions for visualization, converting internal properties into JSON-compatible formats.",
  "sources": "Getter methods of lookup_table, lookup_table.GetTable(), and other VTK object properties.",
  "sinks": "Return dictionaries containing serialized properties; no external system or network I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from VTK object properties through getter methods into Python data structures, then into serialized output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs; comments indicate known rendering issues, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization of visualization objects, with exception handling and comments addressing rendering artifacts. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of standard VTK methods like DeepCopy and property access indicates benign behavior. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with typical visualization serialization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard serialization utility for VTK visualization objects. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects the safe nature of the code.",
