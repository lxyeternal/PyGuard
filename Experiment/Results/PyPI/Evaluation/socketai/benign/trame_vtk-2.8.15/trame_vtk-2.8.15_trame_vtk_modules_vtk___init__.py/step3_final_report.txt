{
  "purpose": "Provides a helper class for managing VTK web visualization, including scene, camera, and protocol communication functionalities.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, imported modules, and internal method calls (e.g., protocol_call, vtk modules).",
  "sinks": "Protocol calls that communicate with client or server components, such as 'viewport.geometry.view.get.state' and 'viewport.image.push'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs through internal processing to protocol calls that send data or commands over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Warnings about missing modules are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard visualization helper that manages scene states, camera settings, and communication protocols. It uses typical patterns for networked visualization tools, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of warnings and print statements are benign and typical for dependency management. Protocol calls are for legitimate visualization tasks, and no obfuscation or suspicious external URLs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured helper module for VTK web visualization with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
