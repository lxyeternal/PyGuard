  "purpose": "The script converts input data files into an HTML file that embeds the data in Base64 format and loads it into a viewer for offline inspection.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a file specified by the '--input' argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes an HTML file with embedded Base64 data, and injects a script that loads the data into a viewer in the output HTML.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> encodes data to Base64 -> inserts Base64 into HTML template -> writes final HTML file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or backdoors observed. The script performs straightforward file encoding and HTML generation.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads a file, encodes its contents in Base64, and embeds it into a static HTML template. It uses standard libraries and practices for file I/O and encoding. The injected script references a local viewer ('OfflineLocalView'), but there is no evidence of external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The script's purpose appears to be data visualization or inspection, with no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for local data visualization. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this module.",
