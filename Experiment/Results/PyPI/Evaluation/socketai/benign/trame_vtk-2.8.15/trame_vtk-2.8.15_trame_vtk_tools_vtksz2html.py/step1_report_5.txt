  "purpose": "Convert input data file into an HTML file that embeds the data as a base64 string for local viewing.",
  "sources": "Input data file specified by --input argument; reads data in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Writes to an HTML output file with embedded base64 data; reads from a static HTML template file.",
  "flows": "Input data read -> base64 encoding -> embedded in HTML script -> HTML file written.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network activity, no dynamic code execution or code injection. The script performs straightforward file reading, encoding, and writing.",
  "analysis": "The script reads an input file specified via command line, encodes its contents in base64, and inserts this data into a static HTML template by appending a script before the closing </body> tag. The process is simple and does not involve any external network connections or hidden behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a benign data visualization helper tool. Since it only handles local files and embeds data in an HTML template, no security risks or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for embedding binary data into an HTML file for local viewing purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on local files with no external communication or suspicious activity.",
