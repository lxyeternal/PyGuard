{
  "purpose": "The script reads binary data from an input file, encodes it in base64, and embeds it into an HTML file using a static viewer template, allowing for local data visualization.",
  "sources": "Input data file specified by the user through the --input argument; file system read operations for the input file and the static HTML template.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated HTML with embedded base64 data into an output file; injects a script tag with base64 data into the HTML content.",
  "flows": "Reads data from the input file -> encodes data to base64 -> reads static HTML template -> injects base64 data via script tag -> writes the final HTML to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual runtime behaviors. The script performs straightforward data encoding and embedding.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads binary data, encodes it, and embeds it into an HTML file using a predefined template. The process is deterministic and intended solely for local viewing. There are no network communications, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The injection of the base64 string into the HTML is benign and occurs within a controlled context. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for visualizing local data files in HTML format. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
