  "purpose": "Embed binary data into a static HTML viewer for local visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data file specified by --input; reads static HTML template (static_viewer.html).",
  "sinks": "Injects Base64-encoded data into HTML script section; no external data transmission or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input file -> read binary data -> encode in base64 -> insert into HTML template -> output HTML file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file I/O, base64 encoding, and HTML injection. It reads local data, encodes it, and embeds it into a static HTML template for local viewing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The injection of base64 data into the HTML is benign, intended solely for visualization. The code is simple, clear, and does not perform any network operations or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for local data visualization with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates minimal threat, and the existing reports' scores are consistent with this analysis.",
