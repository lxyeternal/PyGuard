{
  "purpose": "The script converts binary input data into a base64-encoded string and embeds it into an HTML template for local viewing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a file specified via command-line argument; reads the HTML template 'static_viewer.html' from the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated HTML content, including embedded base64 data and script tags, into an output HTML file.",
  "flows": "Input file is read as binary data → data is base64-encoded → embedded into HTML template with script tags → output HTML file is generated with embedded data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls, no unusual data handling or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a specified binary input file, encodes it to base64, and injects it into a static HTML template by inserting a script section before the closing body tag. The process involves straightforward file I/O, base64 encoding, and string manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The script's function appears solely to facilitate local data visualization without executing untrusted code or accessing external resources. The only potential concern is the dynamic insertion of data into HTML/JavaScript, but since the data is derived solely from an input file and the script does not fetch or send data externally, this is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for local data visualization. It securely reads input, encodes it, and embeds it into an HTML template without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
