  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for local data visualization with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates minimal threat, and the existing reports' scores are consistent with this analysis."
