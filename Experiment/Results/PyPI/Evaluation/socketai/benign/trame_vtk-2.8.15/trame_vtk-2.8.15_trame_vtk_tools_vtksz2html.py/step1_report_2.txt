  "purpose": "The script reads binary data from an input file, converts it to base64, and embeds it into an HTML template for offline viewing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a file specified via command line argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes an HTML file that includes a script injecting base64 data into a webpage.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file -> converts data to base64 -> injects base64 string into HTML template -> outputs HTML file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses straightforward data embedding.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads a user-specified file and embeds its base64-encoded content into an HTML template. It uses standard libraries for file handling and base64 encoding. No untrusted network communication, code injection, or malicious data manipulation is present. The script operates locally, converting input data into a viewable HTML format. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual code patterns. The only potential concern is the injection of base64 data into an HTML file, but this is a benign and expected behavior for data embedding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for embedding binary data into an HTML viewer, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It poses no security risks beyond typical file handling, which is well-managed in the code.",
