  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the provided snippets are solely license comments with no executable code, data input/output, or logic. There are no source points, sinks, or data flows. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the snippets are benign license headers with no security implications.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or malicious code.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the content.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly noting the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since there is no executable code, no suspicious behavior, and only license comments, there is no justification for higher scores. The assessments are appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential assumptions or claims:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the snippets as benign license comments.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the content of the snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe provided snippets are purely license comments with no executable or malicious content. They pose no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No executable code or malicious behavior present.           |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, straightforward comments with no obfuscation.       |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.        |\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of actual code snippets is required.",
