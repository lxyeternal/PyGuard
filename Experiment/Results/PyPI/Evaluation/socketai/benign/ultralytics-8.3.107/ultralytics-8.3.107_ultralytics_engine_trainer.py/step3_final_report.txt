  "purpose": "A comprehensive training framework for YOLO models, handling dataset loading, model setup, distributed training, checkpointing, validation, and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Dataset files, configuration files, environment variables, checkpoint files, subprocess calls for DDP setup",
  "sinks": "Checkpoint files (.pt), logs, CSV results, model serialization, no network activity or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "Data from datasets → model training → checkpoint saving; subprocess for DDP orchestrates multi-GPU setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; subprocess call for DDP is standard in distributed training",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured training pipeline for YOLO models. It includes dataset handling, model loading, distributed training setup, checkpointing, validation, and callback mechanisms. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The subprocess call for DDP is a common pattern and controlled. File operations involve reading/writing checkpoints and logs, all via user-controlled paths. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source training framework with no malicious intent or sabotage. The subprocess call for distributed training is standard and controlled. No indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The overall security risk is very low.",
