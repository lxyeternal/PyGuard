  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The report correctly identifies that the code manages inference results, including detection boxes, masks, keypoints, probabilities, and OBBs, with data flowing from model outputs into class attributes, then to visualization/export functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. External libraries are standard. No signs of malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is secure and well-structured, with high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low risk due to file/database I/O, which is standard).  \n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly notes the classes handle inference results, including detection boxes, masks, keypoints, probabilities, and OBBs, with data from tensors to various formats.  \n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious behavior, no backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. External dependencies are typical.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.95).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no malicious issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Recognizes classes manage detection results, with data flowing into various export functions and visualization, with standard libraries.  \n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious code or suspicious patterns. External dependencies are typical.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous, handling detection results, with data exported to files/databases, standard I/O.  \n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. External libraries are standard.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly notes classes handle inference results, with data flowing into visualization and export functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. File I/O and database operations are standard for result handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0 (no significant security risk).  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. Given the code's purpose and the detailed review, a malware score of **0** is appropriate across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code appears clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation. Score of **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The only potential concern is file/database I/O, which is typical for result handling. A low risk score of **0.2** is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 for all reports, consistent with the current assessments.\n\n**Note:** The detailed reasoning supports that this code is a standard, secure implementation for handling inference results, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n\n| Report # | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|------------|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| 1          | 0              | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 2          | 0              | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 3          | 0              | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 4          | 0              | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 5          | 0              | 0                | 0.2        |\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis above.",
