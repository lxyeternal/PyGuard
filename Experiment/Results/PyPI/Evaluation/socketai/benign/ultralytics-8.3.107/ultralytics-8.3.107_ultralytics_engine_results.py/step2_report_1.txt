  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Clearly describes the classes' roles in handling inference results, with no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, standard result handling library. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to file/database operations, but standard).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to above, with emphasis on data serialization and storage.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard use of pandas, sqlite3, etc.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; functions are typical.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focused on data export and visualization, with standard libraries.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, safe for typical usage.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous, with data handling and export.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior; standard data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; typical for result management.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes data serialization, visualization, and file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious routines.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports due to file/database I/O, but these are standard features.\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is transparent)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard file and database operations, no significant security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a secure, well-structured library for handling inference results with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
