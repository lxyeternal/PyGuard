  "purpose": "The code provides classes for handling inference results from the Ultralytics YOLO models, including detection boxes, masks, keypoints, classification probabilities, and oriented bounding boxes. It manages data manipulation, visualization, exporting, and format conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data such as torch tensors or numpy arrays for boxes, masks, keypoints, and probabilities; reading image and metadata attributes; file operations for save and export functions; database connections for to_sql method.",
  "sinks": "File writing in save, save_txt, save_crop, and export functions; database operations in to_sql; plotting and visualization in plot and show; data serialization to JSON, CSV, XML, HTML, and SQL.",
  "flows": "Data is received via tensor inputs during class initialization (sources), processed and stored in object attributes, and then exported or visualized via functions (sinks). The flow from source attributes to sinks involves data transformations, normalization, and serialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard data handling, visualization, and export tasks consistent with a typical inference results pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured classes that manage inference data for object detection and related tasks. It includes methods for converting between coordinate systems, normalizing data, and exporting results in multiple formats. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system sabotage are present. The only potential concern could be the to_sql method that writes data to an external database; however, it only performs standard database operations with user-supplied data, which is expected for a results processing pipeline. All other functions are typical for visualization, data export, and manipulation. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation for handling and exporting inference results from computer vision models. It performs data management, visualization, and export tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The presence of database export is a common feature and does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and free from malware.",
