  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles inference results, data originates from model outputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data is exported via visualization, files, database; flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is well-structured, manages data, serialization, visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard result handling library. No malware, sabotage, or malicious routines detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, considering standard file/database operations)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, handling inference results, including detection, masks, keypoints, probabilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Export functions, database, visualization; typical data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard classes, data serialization, export, visualization; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation. No signs of malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (consistent with data export functions)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same purpose, handling inference results, including detection, masks, keypoints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Saving images, exporting data, database insertion.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard data management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code for inference results handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, result handling, visualization, export.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** File writing, database, visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, standard libraries.\n- **Analysis:** Typical data processing, no malicious routines.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, handling inference outputs, visualization, export.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Saving files, database, visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Data container classes, standard I/O, visualization, with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign, result handling code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code is consistently well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious routines, or backdoors.**\n- **External dependencies are standard and used for common data handling tasks.**\n- **Export functions (to_json, to_sql, save_txt, etc.) are typical for such libraries.**\n- **No suspicious network activity, code injection, or covert data exfiltration routines are evident.**\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, as code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the nature of the code—handling inference results, exporting data, and visualization—the potential risks are minimal and typical for such libraries. The only slight concern could be the `to_sql()` method that writes to a database, but this is standard and controlled, not malicious.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the external data export and database operations, which are common but should be used carefully).\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments; I agree with their conclusions that the code is safe and standard for inference result handling.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores; the code is secure and free from malicious intent.",
