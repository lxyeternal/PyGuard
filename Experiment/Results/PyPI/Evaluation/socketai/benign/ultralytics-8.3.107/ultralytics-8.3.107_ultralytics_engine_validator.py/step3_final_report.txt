  "purpose": "A validation framework for evaluating YOLO models on datasets, including inference, metrics, visualization, and result export.",
  "sources": "Dataset inputs, model predictions, ground truth labels, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "JSON files (predictions.json), logs, plots, and callback functions.",
  "flows": "Data loading -> preprocessing -> inference -> postprocessing -> metrics update -> visualization/export.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured validation class for YOLO models, handling data, inference, metrics, and exporting results. It uses common libraries and patterns typical for model evaluation pipelines. No malicious functions, network calls, or obfuscated segments are present. The JSON export filename 'predictions.json' is generic and common. Callback mechanisms are flexible but benign. The code does not perform any suspicious operations such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent validation framework for YOLO models with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for supply chain deployment.",
