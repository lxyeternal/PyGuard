{
  "purpose": "The code implements a prediction pipeline for object detection/classification tasks, handling various input sources (images, videos, streams, URLs), performing inference using a loaded model, and saving or displaying results.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from local files, streams, URLs, or tensors; data is loaded via load_inference_source, and images are preprocessed before inference.",
  "sinks": "Results are saved to files (images, videos, text labels), displayed via OpenCV windows, or written to disk; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from source loading → preprocessing → inference → postprocessing → saving/displaying results; callbacks and threading locks manage concurrency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured prediction framework for object detection/classification, with clear data flow and no signs of malicious behavior. It handles multiple input types, performs inference, and outputs results securely. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The security posture is consistent with a legitimate open-source project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate prediction pipeline with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It poses minimal security risk, primarily operational, related to resource consumption during long streams. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
