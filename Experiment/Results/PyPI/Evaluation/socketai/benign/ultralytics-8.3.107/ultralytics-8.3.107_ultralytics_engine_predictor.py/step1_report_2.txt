{
  "purpose": "The code implements a prediction pipeline for object detection and classification using various models and input sources, mainly for visual data like images, videos, and streams.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from file paths, URLs (including YouTube and RTSP streams), webcams, and in-memory images or tensors.",
  "sinks": "Writes inference results to files, directories, videos, or displays them in windows. Also saves labels, crops, and optionally outputs visualizations.",
  "flows": "Input data is preprocessed, passed through a model inference, then postprocessed. Results are optionally saved or displayed, with callbacks triggered at key stages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network exfiltration, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and methods appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code manages model loading, data source setup, streaming inference, and result visualization. It includes mechanisms for thread safety, model warmup, and callback handling. No signs of malicious payloads or malicious data handling routines. All operations pertain to legitimate prediction workflows, with standard file and display outputs. No suspicious network activity or code injection mechanisms are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious data leaks, or system disruption behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate prediction pipeline for computer vision models with no evident malicious intent. It handles various input sources and outputs results appropriately without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
