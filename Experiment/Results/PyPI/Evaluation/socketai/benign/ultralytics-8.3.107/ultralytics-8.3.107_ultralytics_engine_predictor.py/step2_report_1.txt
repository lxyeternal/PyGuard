  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The description aligns with the code's structure—loading models, handling various sources, preprocessing, inference, postprocessing, and saving results.\n- **Anomalies & Security Concerns:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, considering potential resource consumption or misconfigurations, but no real security threat).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a standard prediction pipeline with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Consistent with the code's functionality—reading from multiple sources, inference, visualization, and saving.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code or network activity. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as above—standard prediction pipeline.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a typical inference framework.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Consistent with the code's design—model setup, inference, visualization, saving.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** As expected, handling multiple sources, inference, visualization, no external network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code, no exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard prediction framework.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal operational risk, mostly resource or configuration concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low; mainly related to resource consumption or potential misconfigurations, not security.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The code is a legitimate, open-source prediction framework with no malicious intent or suspicious features.",
