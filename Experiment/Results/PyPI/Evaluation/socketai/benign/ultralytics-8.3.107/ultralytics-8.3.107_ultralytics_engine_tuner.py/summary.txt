  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate hyperparameter tuning utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The subprocess call presents a minimal security surface, but in a controlled environment, it is typical. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to subprocess usage, which is acceptable given the context."
