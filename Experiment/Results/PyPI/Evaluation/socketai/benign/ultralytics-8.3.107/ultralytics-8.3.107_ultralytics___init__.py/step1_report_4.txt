  "purpose": "Initialize environment and import models and utilities for the ultralytics package",
  "sources": "Environment variable check and setting (os.environ), import statements for ultralytics modules",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical security operations",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting occurs before imports; import statements load modules without processing untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable is benign; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior. Importing modules does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to limit CPU utilization during training, which is a common and benign optimization. It then imports several modules from the ultralytics package, and defines a list of exports. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The imports are standard for a machine learning library. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward initialization script for the ultralytics package, setting a configuration environment variable and importing necessary modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
