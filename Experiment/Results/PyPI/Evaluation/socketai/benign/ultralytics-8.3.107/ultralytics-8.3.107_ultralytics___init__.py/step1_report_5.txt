{
  "purpose": "Initialize environment variables, import modules and set export variables for the ultralytics package",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'OMP_NUM_THREADS'; importing modules from ultralytics library; setting __version__ and __all__",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous way; environment variable setting is benign, imports are static",
  "flows": "Environment variable check and set influence process environment; module imports establish available classes and functions for use",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code; only setting environment variables and importing modules",
  "analysis": "The script sets an environment variable to control CPU threads, then imports several modules from a well-known open-source library. No user input handling, no external data fetched during runtime, no suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated patterns. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python package, with no malware behavior or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward initialization script for the ultralytics package, with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
