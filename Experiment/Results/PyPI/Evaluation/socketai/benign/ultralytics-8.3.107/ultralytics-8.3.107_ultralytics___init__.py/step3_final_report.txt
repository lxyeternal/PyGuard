  "purpose": "Initialize environment variables and import core modules for ultralytics package setup.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'OMP_NUM_THREADS'; importing modules from ultralytics package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check/set -> module imports -> export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a benign environment variable to control CPU threads, then imports known modules from a reputable package, and defines version and export info. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The environment variable setting is a common practice in ML workflows. All import statements are static and from trusted sources. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the environment variable setting but overall negligible.",
