  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on potentially untrusted files, which could execute malicious code if files are tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The primary security concern is the use of exec() to load version data from _version.py files, which could be malicious if those files are compromised. No network activity, obfuscation, credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external behaviors are evident. The code is standard for version management, with the exec() pattern being common but risky if files are untrusted. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious code, while security risk scores are moderate (around 0.2-0.4) due to the exec() pattern. The confidence levels are high, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management utility with a known pattern involving executing code from local files. This pattern introduces a supply chain risk if version files are tampered with but does not indicate malicious intent or active malware. The current scores are justified; however, the malware score could be slightly increased to 0.1-0.2 to better reflect the potential risk of executing untrusted files. To mitigate this, consider replacing exec() with safer alternatives such as static imports or verified code execution, and implement file integrity checks.",
