  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management utility with a known pattern involving executing code from local files. This pattern introduces a supply chain risk if version files are tampered with but does not indicate malicious intent or active malware. The current scores are justified; however, the malware score could be slightly increased to 0.1-0.2 to better reflect the potential risk of executing untrusted files. To mitigate this, consider replacing exec() with safer alternatives such as static imports or verified code execution, and implement file integrity checks."
