{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the Version class in the incremental package, verifying comparison operators, string representations, and version string formatting.",
  "sources": "Static data within test cases, creation of Version objects with hardcoded parameters, calls to getVersionString, repr, and comparison assertions.",
  "sinks": "None; all operations are in-memory and involve only internal data.",
  "flows": "In-memory data flow from hardcoded Version instances to comparison and string formatting functions; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; only standard testing procedures and deprecation warnings, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for version comparison, string representation, and version string formatting. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network/file I/O. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The deprecation warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses static data, indicating no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing the Version class, with no security risks or malware indicators. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0) are accurate and justified.",
