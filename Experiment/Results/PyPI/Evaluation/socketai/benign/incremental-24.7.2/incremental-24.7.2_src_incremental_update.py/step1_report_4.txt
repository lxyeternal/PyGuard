{
  "purpose": "This script automates the process of updating version information in a Python package, including modifying version files and source code references.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, reading files in the project directory, reading existing version info from version files.",
  "sinks": "Writing to version files (_version.py), overwriting source code files with updated version references.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> _run() processes version parameters -> reads and updates source files and version files with new version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The script manipulates files to update version references and does not execute untrusted code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages versioning for a Python project. It reads user input to determine version updates, reads existing version information, and updates source files and version files accordingly. It uses standard library functions and third-party libraries (click, os, datetime, pkg_resources, incremental) in a conventional manner. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. The file's intent appears to be version management, with no signs of malware or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs version management tasks without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It safely updates project files based on user input and existing version data. No malicious or suspicious behavior was detected.",
