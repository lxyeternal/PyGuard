{
  "purpose": "The script automates the process of updating version information in Python packages and their associated files, managing version increments, and ensuring consistency across codebases.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments, environment variables (implicitly via os and datetime), and filesystem data when reading/writing version files and code files.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations on version files and source code files, including overwriting content. Also, printing status messages to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line arguments influence version calculations. The script reads existing version data, modifies source code files and version files accordingly, then writes back updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code is present. The code primarily performs version management, with standard use of file operations, string replacements, and command-line argument parsing. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or data exfiltration routines are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party modules for version parsing and command-line handling. It verifies input consistency with multiple conditional checks, preventing conflicting options. The core logic involves reading existing version data, computing new versions, and updating source files and version metadata through string replacements. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code follows standard patterns for version management, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a version updater for Python packages, employing safe and standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It operates solely on filesystem data, modifies files as intended, and does not perform any network or privacy-intrusive activities.",
