  "purpose": "Provides incremental version information for the package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Version' class from 'incremental' library, creation of version object with fixed parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; static data assignment, no untrusted input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of 'Version' -> creation of '__version__' -> export via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static version declaration module that imports a class from a third-party library, creates a version object with fixed parameters, and exports it. There are no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behaviors. The comments indicate auto-generation, and the structure is standard for version info files. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
