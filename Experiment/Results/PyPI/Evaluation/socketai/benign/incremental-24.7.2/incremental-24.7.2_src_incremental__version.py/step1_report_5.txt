  "purpose": "Provides incremental version information for a package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the 'incremental' library, assignment of version object, and a string list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical sinks; version information is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, uses standard library import, and sets a static version; no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version class, sets a static version value, and declares an export list. It contains no user input handling, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no secrets. The only potential concern is that it is auto-generated, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version info module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It merely defines and exports version data.",
