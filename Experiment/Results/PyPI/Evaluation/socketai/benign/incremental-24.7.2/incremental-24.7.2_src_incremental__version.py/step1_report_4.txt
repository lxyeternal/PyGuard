{
  "purpose": "Provides version information for the Incremental package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from incremental import Version' and the version string assignment '__version__ = Version(...)'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of the version object to __version__, which is a standard practice; no sinks for untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "The import of 'Version' from 'incremental' leads to creation of the '__version__' variable, which is a static data assignment with no flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, contains a comment explicitly warning against editing, and only defines static version data. No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily defining a version string for the package. It imports a 'Version' class, creates a version object, and exposes it via '__all__'. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic data handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The auto-generated comment indicates standard maintenance practice, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely used to define package version information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks present.",
