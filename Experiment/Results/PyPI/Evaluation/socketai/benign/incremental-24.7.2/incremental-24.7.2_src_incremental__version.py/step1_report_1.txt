{
  "purpose": "Provides incremental version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a version string using a class imported from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The version information is statically assigned; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates auto-generation, but there are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'Version' class from a third-party library 'incremental', then creates a version object with specific version numbers. The file is marked as auto-generated, suggesting it is a standard versioning script. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
