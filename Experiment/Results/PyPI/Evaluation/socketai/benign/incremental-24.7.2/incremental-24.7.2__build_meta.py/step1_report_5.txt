  "flows": "Import of build_meta from setuptools (source) and exposing it via __all__ (sink), but no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward re-export of a standard library component.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'build_meta' object from the 'setuptools' package and re-exports it via __all__ for use as a PEP 517 backend. The comments clarify compliance with PEP 517 requirements. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and uses standard library features only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal re-export of setuptools' build_meta to serve as a compliant build backend. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
