  "purpose": "This code re-exports the setuptools 'build_meta' for PEP 517 compliance, specifically to manage in-tree backends with custom backend-path configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from setuptools import build_meta'. The code also reads the module's docstring at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or sent over network, nor are there any command executions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'build_meta' from 'setuptools' and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The code is minimal, straightforward, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export of 'setuptools.build_meta' to satisfy PEP 517 restrictions. It contains a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose. There are no input/output flows, no code execution, and no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for managing build configurations in Python projects. It appears to be a legitimate and safe snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
