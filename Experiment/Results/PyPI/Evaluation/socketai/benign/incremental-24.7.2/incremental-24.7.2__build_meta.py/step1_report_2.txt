  "purpose": "Re-exporting setuptools' build_meta for in-tree backend compliance with PEP 517.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing build_meta from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Import of build_meta (trusted library) without any data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code merely re-exports a standard library component with no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports build_meta from setuptools and exposes it via __all__, serving as a wrapper to meet PEP 517 requirements. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no external communication. It relies solely on a trusted, widely used library. The purpose is configuration compliance, not execution of malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and transparent. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It functions solely as a re-export for compatibility purposes.",
