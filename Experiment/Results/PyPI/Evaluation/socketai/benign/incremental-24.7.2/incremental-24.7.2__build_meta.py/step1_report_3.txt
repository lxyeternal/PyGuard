  "purpose": "This code re-exports the build_meta object from setuptools for in-tree build backend configuration according to PEP 517.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from setuptools import build_meta",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted inputs; straightforward import and export",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a simple re-export, with comments explaining compliance requirements",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports and exposes setuptools' build_meta for custom build backend configuration. The comments clarify compliance with PEP 517's restrictions on in-tree backends. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic present. No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The structure is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration shim to specify the build backend in compliance with PEP 517. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
