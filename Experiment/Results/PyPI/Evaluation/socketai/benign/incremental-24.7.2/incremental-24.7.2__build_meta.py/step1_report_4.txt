  "purpose": "The code is intended to re-export setuptools' build_meta to comply with PEP 517 requirements for in-tree backend handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from setuptools import build_meta'",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or execution of untrusted data",
  "flows": "Import of 'build_meta' from setuptools; re-exported via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hidden or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'build_meta' from the setuptools package and exposes it via __all__. There are no input sources beyond the standard import, no data flows to untrusted destinations, and no dynamic code execution. It serves as a simple module to re-export a dependency for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal re-export of setuptools' 'build_meta'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
