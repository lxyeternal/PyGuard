  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script intended for data processing or system management.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, user input functions, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, if any are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to sinks via function calls or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements detected. No suspicious network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard Python syntax and no signs of malicious constructs. No suspicious functions like exec or eval, no hidden code, and no obfuscated parts. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and justified. No hardcoded secrets or environment variable leaks identified. The code's structure suggests typical data processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It is a normal script for its apparent purpose, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
