  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, anomaly detection, and scoring consistency.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, function calls, environment variables, network activity, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, eval()/exec() calls, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as untrusted input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via eval() or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual patterns include use of eval() with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent in the provided reports, leading to appropriate zero scores. When code is described, it appears benign, with no malicious functions or suspicious patterns. The use of eval() is noted as a potential risk but not malicious, aligning with low malware scores and low security risk scores (0.2). The confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), justified by thorough reasoning. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected, and the scoring is consistent with the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and consistent with their descriptions. The absence of code results in zero malware and obfuscation scores. When code is present, assessments of benign behavior with low risk are justified. No revisions are necessary; the scoring and reasoning are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
