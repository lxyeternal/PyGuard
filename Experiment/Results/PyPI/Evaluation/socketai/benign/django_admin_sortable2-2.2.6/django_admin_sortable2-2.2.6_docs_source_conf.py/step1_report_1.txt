  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'django-admin-sortable2' project.",
  "sources": "import statements (datetime, os, sys), sys.path modification, import of __version__ from adminsortable2.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily reads local files and modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Use of standard libraries and typical configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, importing modules, modifying sys.path, setting project metadata, and configuring extensions and themes. No signs of malicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The only external reference is to documentation URLs and an import from a local module for version info. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical configuration script for documentation generation with Sphinx. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
