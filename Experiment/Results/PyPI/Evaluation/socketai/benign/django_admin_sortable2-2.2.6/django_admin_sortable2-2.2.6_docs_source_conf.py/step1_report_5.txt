  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating Sphinx documentation for the django-admin-sortable2 project.",
  "sources": "Reads system paths, datetime for current date, and imports __version__ from adminsortable2.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a standard configuration pattern with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The commented-out sys.path modification is benign and common in Sphinx configs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up documentation build parameters, including project info, extensions, paths, and theme. It imports system modules and the package version, which are standard practices. No dynamic execution, network activity, or credential handling present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to configure documentation generation without any suspicious behavior.",
