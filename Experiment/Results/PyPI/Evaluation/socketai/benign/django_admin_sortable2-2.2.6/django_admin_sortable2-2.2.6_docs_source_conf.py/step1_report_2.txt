  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder to generate project documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (datetime, os, sys), reads version info from 'adminsortable2', and accesses environment variables for path setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not write untrusted data or perform network actions.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for Sphinx configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up the environment for generating documentation, including modifying sys.path, importing version info, and configuring theme and extension options. All operations are standard and do not involve user input, untrusted data, or network activity. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply sets up documentation build parameters.",
