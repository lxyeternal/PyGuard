  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script, reading 'README.md' and importing version info, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, no network activity. The source and sink are controlled, and the code adheres to typical setup patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also standard, with a note that reading 'README.md' is normal.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), perhaps due to reading a file, but reading a local file in setup is common and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, but perhaps slightly overestimating risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing standard practices.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the process is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — fitting.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in one report due to reading a file, but this is common in setup scripts and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is reading 'README.md', which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing occurs.\n- The version import from 'adminsortable2' is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The overall risk is negligible. The scores should reflect that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with a benign setup script. No further action needed.",
