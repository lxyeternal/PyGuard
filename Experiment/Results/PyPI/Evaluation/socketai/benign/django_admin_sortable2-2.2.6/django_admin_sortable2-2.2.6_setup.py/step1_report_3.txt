{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'django-admin-sortable2' package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Import statements for io, setuptools, and __version__; readfile function reading README.md; package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code indicates untrusted data processing or output, typical setup script sinks like network, file, or command execution are absent.",
  "flows": "The code reads a file ('README.md') for description content but does not process or execute untrusted input. It then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets (apart from author email which is public), or obfuscated elements are present. The code follows standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration. It imports necessary modules, defines a function to read the README file, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious logic is present. The only dynamic element is reading a local file for the long description, which is normal in package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common practices and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
