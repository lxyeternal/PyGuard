  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n   - It imports version info from `adminsortable2.__version__`.\n   - Reads `README.md` for the long description.\n   - Calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata and dependencies.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Risks:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - It is a typical setup script, which is inherently safe.\n   - The only minor point is reading a local file (`README.md`), which is standard practice and not a security concern.\n   - The import of `__version__` from `adminsortable2` is safe assuming the package is trustworthy.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - Obfuscation scores are 0, which is accurate since the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n4. **Security Risk Scores:**\n   - All reports give a security risk score of 0 or 0.1.\n   - Given the analysis, the minimal risk score of 0.1 might be slightly overstated, as reading static files and importing version info do not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n   - The reports are consistent in identifying this as a benign, standard setup script.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n   - The overall assessment: **no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks.**\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.",
