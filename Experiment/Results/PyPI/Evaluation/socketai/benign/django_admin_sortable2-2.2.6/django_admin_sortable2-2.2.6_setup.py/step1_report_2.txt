{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'django-admin-sortable2', including metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'adminsortable2.__version__' and the README content from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input are present; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks is detected. The version info is imported directly, and README content is read from a local file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a version number from a third-party library, reads a local README file, and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The package dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package distribution. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely to define package metadata and configuration for distribution. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, no obfuscated elements, and no security risks. The setup script appears safe and standard.",
