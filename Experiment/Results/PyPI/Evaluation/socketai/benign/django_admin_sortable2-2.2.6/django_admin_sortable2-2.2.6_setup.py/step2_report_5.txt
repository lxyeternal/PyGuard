  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading 'README.md' and version from 'adminsortable2.__version__'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic code execution; only static file reading.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with version imported from 'adminsortable2.__version__'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard package setup, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, reading README.md and version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk is justifiable as the script reads a local file, but this is standard practice; the minimal risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward, standard packaging code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for package setup, with no network, system commands, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a very low risk score (0 or 0.1) is justified. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor point is the reading of 'README.md' for long description, which is standard practice.\n- Importing version info from the package itself is common and safe.\n- No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or external data handling is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to the minimal risk associated with reading a local file, which is standard in setup scripts)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports and the code's straightforward nature.",
