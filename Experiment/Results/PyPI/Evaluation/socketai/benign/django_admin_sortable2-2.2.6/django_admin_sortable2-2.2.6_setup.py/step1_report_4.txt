{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'django-admin-sortable2' using setuptools, including package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from the '__version__' attribute in 'adminsortable2', reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and static string literals for metadata such as author, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or executes external commands; it primarily reads files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no untrusted data flows or external data processing beyond reading static files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: importing necessary modules, reading a version string from the package, reading a README file for long description, and calling setup() with package metadata and configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, external data manipulations, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted code or performing network operations.",
