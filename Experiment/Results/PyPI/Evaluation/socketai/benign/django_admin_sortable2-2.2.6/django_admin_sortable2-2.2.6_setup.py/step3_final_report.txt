  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the django-admin-sortable2 library, reading static files and importing version info from a trusted package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing '__version__' from 'adminsortable2'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; static file reading and trusted import only",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' for long description; import version from package; pass static metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script with static data sources and no dynamic or untrusted inputs. It reads a local README file and imports version info from a trusted package, both standard practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified by reading a local file, which is common in setup scripts. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications needed.",
