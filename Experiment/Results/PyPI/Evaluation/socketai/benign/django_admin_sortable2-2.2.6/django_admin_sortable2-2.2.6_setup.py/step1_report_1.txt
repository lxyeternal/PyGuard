{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'django-admin-sortable2', including metadata and dependencies, for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the package description file 'README.md' using the readfile function, importing version info from adminsortable2, and static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly directs untrusted data to sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands. The only file I/O is reading a static file ('README.md').",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the content of 'README.md' to populate the long_description field, which is a controlled and static operation. No user input or untrusted data flows into critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and retrieves package version info. It reads a markdown file for the long description. All fields are statically defined or read from trusted sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling occurs. The purpose is to configure package installation metadata. The code appears typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, with safe file reading operations.",
