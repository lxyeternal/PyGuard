  "purpose": "This script initializes a Django management command environment and executes commands based on command-line input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), environment variables (via os.environ), and imports Django modules.",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line may process untrusted commands from sys.argv; environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' is set.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line; environment variable -> Django setup; exception handling captures and prints errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard Django CLI bootstrap with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default Django settings module, then runs Django's command-line utility. Exception handling captures and prints errors but does not conceal or alter behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, and no suspicious dynamic execution are present. The environment variable setting is standard for Django projects. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django management command bootstrap, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code. It functions as expected for initializing and running Django CLI commands.",
