  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of a variable assignment: `__version__ = '2.2.6'`. There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or any other logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration, which is common in Python packages. No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, aligning with the absence of any malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, since this code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Any Reason to Adjust Scores?**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness, there is no justification for increasing any scores. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify that this is a benign version declaration.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard practice for defining a package version. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk involved.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.  \n- No further action or increased risk assessment is necessary.\n\n**My own estimate for the scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
