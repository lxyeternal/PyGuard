  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no functions, data processing, input/output, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
