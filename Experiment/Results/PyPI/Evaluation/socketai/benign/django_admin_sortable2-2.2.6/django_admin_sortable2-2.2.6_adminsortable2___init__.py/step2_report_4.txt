  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external interactions, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard practice for version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or risky behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - All reports are consistent in assigning a risk score of 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are based on direct code analysis.\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\nThis code snippet is a minimal, standard version declaration. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
