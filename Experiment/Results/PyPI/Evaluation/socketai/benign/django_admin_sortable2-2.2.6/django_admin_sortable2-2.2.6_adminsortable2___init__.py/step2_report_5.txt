  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs involved. This is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \nAll reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. The code is straightforward, with no data flows, sinks, or sources that could indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign a 0, which is correct given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious code.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond the code's apparent simplicity.  \n- They do not overlook any hidden behavior because the code is trivial.\n\n5. **Score Justification**  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.  \n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the simplicity of the code, there's no need to adjust scores upward. The reports are thorough and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores: 0, 0, 0.**",
