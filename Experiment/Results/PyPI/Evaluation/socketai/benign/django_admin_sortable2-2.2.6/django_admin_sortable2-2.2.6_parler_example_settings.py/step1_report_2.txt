  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings for a unit testing environment, including database, static/media paths, installed apps, middleware, and localization.",
  "sources": "Configuration values such as SECRET_KEY, database path, static/media URLs and paths, and language settings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external input processing evident.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input to sensitive sinks; static configurations are hardcoded with standard values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded SECRET_KEY ('secret'), which is insecure for production, but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module for development or testing, with static and hardcoded configuration values. No user input handling or external data sources are involved. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, network communication, or data exfiltration. The SECRET_KEY is weak but not malicious; it does not compromise security here. The configuration is standard, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django settings file intended for testing, containing no malicious behavior or security threats. The only notable issue is the use of a weak, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which should be changed in production, but this does not represent malicious intent.",
