  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings for a unit testing environment, including database, static/media paths, installed apps, middleware, and internationalization.",
  "sources": "Static paths (STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT, MEDIA_URL, STATIC_URL), SECRET_KEY, and installed apps.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data handling or external network connections present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True in a production-like configuration can be security risks, but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module tailored for a testing environment. It includes typical configurations with no dynamic or external data inputs, no network connections, and no credential handling beyond static secrets. The use of hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode is acceptable in a test context but would be insecure in production. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign Django settings configuration for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident based on this code. It is safe to use in a controlled testing environment.",
