{
  "purpose": "This code is a Django settings configuration intended for unit testing environments, containing static, non-sensitive default values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded values such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, database paths, and static/media URLs.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or external interactions are present; the configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded secrets ('secret') and debug mode enabled, which are insecure for production but typical for testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Django settings module with no malicious logic, obfuscated code, or external data handling. The only security concern is the use of insecure defaults (hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True), which are acceptable in testing but should be changed for production. No signs of malicious behavior, external network activity, or supply chain compromise are evident. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test configuration with no malicious intent or supply chain attack indicators. The primary concern is insecure defaults, which are acceptable in a testing context but should be addressed before deployment.",
