  "purpose": "Django project configuration settings for a unit test environment.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables such as SECRET_KEY, DATABASES, MEDIA_ROOT, STATIC_ROOT, and PARLER_LANGUAGES.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is used; static and media URLs/paths are static strings, and no data is sent over the network.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'secret', which is insecure for production but not malicious. The code contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All configurations appear standard for a Django app in a testing environment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module, defining configurations for database, templates, static/media files, and language settings. No user input handling or untrusted data processing is present. The SECRET_KEY is weak but static, which is acceptable in a test setting. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. All third-party apps are known and reputable, and no code points to malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django settings configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the static SECRET_KEY, which should not be used in production but is acceptable here. Overall, the code appears safe.",
