{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python library class for use with Robot Framework, specifically for Faker keywords, and retrieves the package version from the distribution metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via pkg_resources.get_distribution('robotframework-faker').version and imports the FakerKeywords class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code does not handle user input or network data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing package metadata to setting class attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard package metadata retrieval and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Python library (pkg_resources) to retrieve package version info, which is typical for maintaining versioning consistency. It imports a class from a local module, then defines a subclass for Robot Framework with a specified scope. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation for a Robot Framework library wrapper around Faker keywords. It performs typical package version retrieval and class setup without any signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
