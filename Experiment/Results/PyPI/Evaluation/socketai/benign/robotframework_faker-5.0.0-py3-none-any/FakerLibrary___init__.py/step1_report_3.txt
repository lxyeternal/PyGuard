{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class 'FakerLibrary' that inherits from 'FakerKeywords', and sets a global scope for use in Robot Framework. It also retrieves the package version for 'robotframework-faker'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from installed distribution via pkg_resources.get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "The version string from the package distribution flows from the 'pkg_resources.get_distribution' call to the '__version__' variable; no further data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The imported module '.keywords' may contain additional code, but is not provided here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' to obtain the version of the 'robotframework-faker' package, and imports 'FakerKeywords' from a local module. It defines a class inheriting from 'FakerKeywords' with a global scope setting. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or credential usages. The code appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign module that primarily manages version retrieval and class inheritance with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks.",
