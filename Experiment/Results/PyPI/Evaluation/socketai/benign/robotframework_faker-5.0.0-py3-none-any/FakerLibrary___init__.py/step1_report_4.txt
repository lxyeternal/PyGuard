  "purpose": "To define a Python library class for Robot Framework that extends FakerKeywords, likely for generating fake data in tests.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"robotframework-faker\").version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; the version info is retrieved for informational purposes",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources to retrieve the version of the 'robotframework-faker' package dynamically. It defines a class 'FakerLibrary' extending 'FakerKeywords' with a global scope. There are no user inputs, external data, or suspicious code flows. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library setup for Robot Framework, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
