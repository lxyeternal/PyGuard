  "purpose": "A wrapper for the Faker library to provide Robot Framework keywords for generating fake data.",
  "sources": "Input data is processed through _str_to_data, which is used in arguments for Faker functions and seed method.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Faker methods that generate data, and the seed method for reproducibility.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted via _str_to_data, then passed to Faker functions or seed, which generate data or set seeds.",
  "anomalies": "Use of _str_to_data to evaluate string inputs; dynamic attribute access; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thin wrapper around the Faker library, adding functionality to interpret string arguments as data structures via ast.literal_eval. It dynamically exposes Faker methods as Robot Framework keywords. The seed function allows reproducibility. No network activity, file access, or data exfiltration code is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. Use of literal_eval is safe here as it only evaluates string representations of Python literals. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper around the Faker library for use in Robot Framework. It provides data generation functionalities without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are detected.",
