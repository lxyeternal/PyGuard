  "purpose": "A wrapper around the Faker library exposing its methods as Robot Framework keywords, with safe string parsing and dynamic method access.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions, especially seed and method names, and internal Faker method calls.",
  "sinks": "Faker data generation methods, seed setting, and dynamic attribute access.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed via _str_to_data, then used to invoke Faker methods or set seed; no external data flows to network or files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ast.literal_eval for input parsing, and dynamic method access via __getattr__ without explicit validation, which could be risky if method names are externally manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Faker, providing access to Faker's methods with controlled input parsing. The use of ast.literal_eval is safe in this context, assuming inputs are controlled. Dynamic method access via __getattr__ could be exploited if method names are manipulated externally, but since only known Faker methods are invoked, the risk is minimal. No network, file, or malicious code is present. The code does not obfuscate or contain malicious patterns. The security assessment indicates negligible risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to dynamic method invocation and input parsing considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper for Faker with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. Minor concerns about dynamic method access and input parsing are justified but do not pose a real threat in this controlled context.",
