  "purpose": "A thin wrapper for the faker library to expose faker methods as Robot Framework keywords.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments in the wrapper methods, especially seed values and method names.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be injected via method names or arguments used in faker functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (method arguments or attribute names) flows through _str_to_data processing into faker methods via __getattr__ or direct calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access and string evaluation with ast.literal_eval; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps faker library functions for Robot Framework integration. It uses _str_to_data to parse string inputs into data structures, reducing risk of injection. The __getattr__ method dynamically resolves method names, which could be exploited if method names are untrusted, but since only faker methods are invoked, this appears controlled. There are no network operations, no file access, or suspicious system calls. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. The use of wrapt for decorators is standard and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around faker with no indications of malicious intent or backdoors. The dynamic method resolution is controlled by the list of faker and generator methods. No malicious behavior or malware is evident.",
