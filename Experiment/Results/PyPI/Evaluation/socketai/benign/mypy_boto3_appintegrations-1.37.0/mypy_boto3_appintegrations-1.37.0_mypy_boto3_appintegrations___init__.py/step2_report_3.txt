  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports classes, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports.\n- No runtime logic, user input, network, or external data handling is present.\n- The documentation is static, with usage examples, but no dynamic code execution.\n- The copyright date is 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code serves as an SDK interface, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation for appintegrations.\n- **Findings:** Static strings, no untrusted data sinks, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup, client creation, pagination.\n- **Findings:** Import statements, no untrusted data sinks, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** Future-dated copyright (2025) noted but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1 (possibly due to the future date).\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the code's nature. It could be lowered to 0, as no actual risk exists.\n\n**Score adjustment:** Reduce `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, straightforward SDK interface.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Future date again noted but not malicious.\n- Security risk score is 0.1, which might be slightly high.\n\n**Score adjustment:** Same as above, lower `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard SDK interface, no malicious code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Score:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, a simple module defining imports and exports.\n- No runtime logic or external data handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Security risk score is 0, appropriate.\n\n**Score:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring adjustments:\n\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, except for reports 2 and 3, which are 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, these should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code is a straightforward SDK interface with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are thorough and correctly identify that the code is benign. The only minor point is the security risk score in reports 2 and 3, which should be adjusted downward to 0, reflecting the absence of any real security concern.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues.",
