  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports classes, defines an alias, and exports symbols via `__all__`. It contains documentation and usage examples.\n- No dynamic logic, user input, external data handling, or network interactions are present.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The copyright date is 2025, which is future-dated, but this alone isn't malicious.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- They mention the future-dated copyright as potentially a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n- The analysis appears consistent and reasonable given the static nature of the code.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0.1).\n- These seem appropriate given the static, import-only nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports or the code suggest any active or potential malicious behavior.\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- No justification exists for higher scores, and none are assigned.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that there is no malicious activity.\n- The code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a static interface module.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright, which is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low or zero, matching the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.**  \n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to future-dated copyright, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the unusual copyright date, which is not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, static SDK interface module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should remain low.",
