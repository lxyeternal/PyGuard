  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their claims, the scores assigned, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily a straightforward interface module with documentation, imports, and class aliases.\n- No evidence of dynamic behavior, user input handling, external data processing, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The only minor point is the future-dated copyright (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation for appintegrations.\n- **Findings:** Static strings, no external data sinks, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup and client creation.\n- **Findings:** Static imports, no untrusted data, future copyright date.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data, just static setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior, only the future date noted.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1 (due to the future date, which is minor).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable; the date is likely a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK interface with documentation.\n- **Findings:** Imports, no data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Documentation and re-exports.\n- **Findings:** Static imports, no data flows.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Interface for the service.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no data handling, safe structure.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the future-dated copyright, which is minor and not indicative of security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low; the only minor concern is the future date, which is likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a simple SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, though I would suggest:\n\n- Keeping the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Reducing the securityRisk score to around 0.05, reflecting the negligible concern over the date placeholder.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The current scoring is reasonable, and no significant changes are necessary.",
