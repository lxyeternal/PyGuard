{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for the appintegrations service SDK, importing necessary classes and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, documentation strings, and class definitions; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining imports, class aliases, and exports for a SDK interface. It contains no dynamic logic, user input handling, network operations, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The documentation and structure are straightforward. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate but could be lowered to zero given the static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The current assessment scores are accurate; minor risk scores could be adjusted to zero, but the existing scores are acceptable. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
