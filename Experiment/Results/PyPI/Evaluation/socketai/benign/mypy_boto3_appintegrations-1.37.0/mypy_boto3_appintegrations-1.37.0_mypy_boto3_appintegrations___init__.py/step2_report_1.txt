  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the module as an interface with documentation, static strings, and imports.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, user input, external data handling, or suspicious code. The code is purely structural.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minimal, likely due to static documentation). The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The minimal securityRisk score is acceptable given the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on SDK setup, with a note on the future-dated copyright.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious patterns. The future date is likely a placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The minor securityRisk is just a conservative estimate for static documentation code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—imports and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, data handling, or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on documentation and import statements.\n- **Analysis:** No data flows or external data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent; the code is a static interface module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward interface with no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the static documentation and import setup, which do not pose security risks. The assigned scores of 0.1 are conservative and acceptable.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\nGiven the static, non-executable nature of this module, and the absence of any external data handling, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0** — No security risks present.\n\n**Note:** The existing reports' scores are reasonable, but I would suggest setting the securityRisk score to 0 for all reports, as there is no evidence of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Security Risk   | 0                   | Static interface code with no external or dynamic data flows.|\n\n---\n\n**Final remark:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe. No changes needed beyond possibly adjusting the securityRisk scores to zero.",
