  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward SDK interface module with documentation, imports, class aliases, and exports.\n- No dynamic logic, user input, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, data flow, or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup, client creation, pagination.\n- **Analysis:** Static import/setup, no external data or network activity.\n- **Note:** The future copyright date (2025) is noted as potentially a placeholder but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to the date anomaly).\n\n**Comment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, given the future date anomaly, but not indicative of a real threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Similar to above, with emphasis on the absence of dynamic code or external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same pattern: import/setup, documentation, no external data, no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar, straightforward SDK interface with no external data or logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; setting this to 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), likely due to the future-dated copyright. This is not a security risk but could be flagged as a minor anomaly.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- For the **risk score**, I would recommend **0** across all reports because there's no actual security concern—just a possible placeholder or typo.\n- The **securityRisk** scores of 0.1 are marginal and could be lowered to 0 for consistency, unless the placeholder date is considered a sign of incomplete or placeholder code, which isn't inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | No malicious activity or obfuscation; only documentation and imports. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Static setup, no external data; date anomaly not security concern. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same reasoning; no dynamic or malicious code. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            | No external interactions or malicious signs. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Pure interface code, safe and standard. |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk; minor date anomaly not a threat)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no security concerns.",
