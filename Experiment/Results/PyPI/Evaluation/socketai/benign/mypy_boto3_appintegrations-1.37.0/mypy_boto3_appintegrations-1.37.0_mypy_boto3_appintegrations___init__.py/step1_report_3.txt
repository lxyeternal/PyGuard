  "purpose": "Main interface for appintegrations service, providing imports and documentation for the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static strings, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code is primarily a standard SDK interface with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SDK components, defines an alias, and lists exports. No input handling, data processing, or external calls are present. It is a straightforward module setup for an SDK, with no dynamic code execution or external data sources that could be malicious. The presence of licensing info and documentation strings does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard SDK interface setup without malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with imports, an alias, and documentation. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
