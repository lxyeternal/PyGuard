  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-appintegrations, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward, well-formed setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, no dynamic or external data handling, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a risk score of 0. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
