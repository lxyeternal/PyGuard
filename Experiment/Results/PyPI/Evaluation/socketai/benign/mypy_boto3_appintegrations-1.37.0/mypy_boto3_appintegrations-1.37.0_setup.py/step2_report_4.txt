  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with static metadata, reading a local README.md file, and calling `setup()` with predefined parameters.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it's a typical `setup.py` script.\n- **Malware / malicious behavior:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code follows standard packaging practices.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- None. All assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security issues or malicious code. The detailed analysis confirms the absence of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Maintain scores as-is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.**",
