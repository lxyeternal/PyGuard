  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-appintegrations library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; reads environment variables indirectly via setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> passes data to setup() parameters; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script. It reads a local file for description, imports setup, and calls setup() with static data. All data used is hardcoded or from a file, with no external inputs or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks present. It appears to be a benign, well-structured package configuration.",
