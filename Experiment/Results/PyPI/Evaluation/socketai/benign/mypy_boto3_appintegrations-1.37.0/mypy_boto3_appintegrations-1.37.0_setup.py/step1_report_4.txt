  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-appintegrations Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static package metadata such as name, version, author info, classifiers, keywords, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is static or file-based. No user input or network data is processed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a markdown file for the long description. It then calls setuptools.setup() with static package configuration data, including package info, URLs, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, input handling, or untrusted data sources are present. The code is straightforward and conforms to standard packaging practices. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
