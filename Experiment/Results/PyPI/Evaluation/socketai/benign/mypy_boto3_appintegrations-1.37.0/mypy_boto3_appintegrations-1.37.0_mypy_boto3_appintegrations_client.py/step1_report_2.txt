  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AppIntegrations service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; string constants for documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; methods primarily define API interface without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Method definitions with typed parameters and return types, mostly for API request and response structures; no data flows from sources to sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and interface layer for boto3's AppIntegrations client. It defines classes, exception types, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. No suspicious logic, code injection, data leakage, or malicious operations are present. All elements align with standard SDK typing practices, and no signs of sabotage or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation layer for a boto3 client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It functions solely as an interface and type safety enhancement.",
