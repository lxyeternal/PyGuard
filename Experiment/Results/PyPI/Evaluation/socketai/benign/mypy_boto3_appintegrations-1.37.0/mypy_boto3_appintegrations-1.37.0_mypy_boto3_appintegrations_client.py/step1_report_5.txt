  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 AppIntegrations service, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and inline docstrings within the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that call AWS APIs, particularly generate_presigned_url, and any data handling within method signatures and docstrings.",
  "flows": "Code imports -> class and method definitions -> method signatures and docstrings -> potential API calls (e.g., generate_presigned_url, create/update/delete operations).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. All methods appear to be standard AWS SDK type annotations and client wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings for the boto3 AppIntegrations client. It imports necessary modules, defines a class for exceptions, and a client class with methods corresponding to AWS API operations. No code executes dynamically, does not perform network operations, nor contains obfuscated or suspicious logic. The generate_presigned_url method aligns with AWS SDK behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration code. The code appears to be a straightforward type stub/interface for the AWS SDK, used for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard SDK interface definition with type annotations for AWS AppIntegrations service. It provides type hints for the AWS SDK client without executing any harmful operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
