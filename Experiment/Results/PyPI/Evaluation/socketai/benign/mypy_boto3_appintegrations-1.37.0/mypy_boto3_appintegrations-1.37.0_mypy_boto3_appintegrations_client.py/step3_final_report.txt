  "purpose": "Static type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 AppIntegrations client, with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Class and method signatures, type definitions, and import statements; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures potentially accepting untrusted data, but no actual data processing occurs in this static interface.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely static interface signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright date '2025' likely a placeholder or typo; no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured SDK stub with type annotations, no executable logic, no data flow involving untrusted sources, and no obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which is not security-relevant. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score is slightly elevated in some reports (e.g., 0.5 or 0.1), but given the static nature, it should be near zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static interface with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime logic. The scores are appropriate; the only note is the future copyright date, which is likely a placeholder. The overall security assessment is that this code is safe and non-malicious.",
