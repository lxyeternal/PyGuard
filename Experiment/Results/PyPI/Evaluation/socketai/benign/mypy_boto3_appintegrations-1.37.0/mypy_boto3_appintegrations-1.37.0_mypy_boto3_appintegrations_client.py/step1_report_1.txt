{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the boto3 AppIntegrations service, facilitating type-safe API calls and paginator creation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, package imports, and function signatures. It does not read external input or user data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly defines interfaces and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; this is a static interface definition without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains copyright date '2025', which is in the future, indicating a potential inconsistency or placeholder. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface for the AWS AppIntegrations client, providing method signatures, overloads, and exception definitions. It only involves static imports, type aliases, and method definitions with no runtime logic or data handling. The presence of future date copyright appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this static interface code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type annotations and interface definition for the boto3 AppIntegrations client. It poses no malware threat and has no security risks beyond general API interface design. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, likely a placeholder or typo.",
