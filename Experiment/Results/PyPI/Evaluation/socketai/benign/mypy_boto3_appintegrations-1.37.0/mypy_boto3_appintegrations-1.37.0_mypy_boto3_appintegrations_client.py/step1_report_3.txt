  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AppIntegrations Service Client, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS AppIntegrations via boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, type hints, and property declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines types and method signatures without executing external or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code contains no executable logic or data flow, only type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly defines client interface with no runtime logic or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party typing modules, defines an Exceptions class for AWS error handling, and a client class with method signatures matching AWS API operations. No executable logic, data processing, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be standard SDK interface definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or anomalous code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, well-structured type stub definition for AWS AppIntegrations client. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides type annotations to facilitate static type checking in Python projects. The malware score is low, and there are no security concerns.",
