{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 AppIntegrations service, providing structured access to AWS resources.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party modules (botocore, typing_extensions), and type definitions; class and method definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that could potentially handle untrusted data, such as generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, and update operations, but no explicit untrusted data sources or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (mostly **kwargs unpacked from type defs) are passed into boto3 client methods; no explicit data flows indicating malicious intent are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard boto3 client stub with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for an AWS SDK client, primarily for documentation and type-checking purposes. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines exception classes, and outlines method signatures with clear typing. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The use of type defs and method signatures aligns with typical SDK stub implementations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK stub implementation for AWS AppIntegrations, designed for type safety and documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is standard, and no indicators of supply chain attacks or sabotage are observed.",
