  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code content and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes static type annotations for the boto3 AppIntegrations client; no runtime data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow; purely interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, suggesting placeholder or typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that this is a static interface with no malicious code. The future date is a minor anomaly, not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware or security risk. The score of 0 for malware and security risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations for the boto3 client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or dynamic logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code structures or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK interface definitions with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score of 0, security risk of 0, aligns well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, class definitions, exception classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, class, and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit untrusted data sources or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK stub, no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware 0, security risk very low, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, docstrings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods like `generate_presigned_url`, which could potentially be used maliciously, but in this context, it's a standard SDK method.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard interface, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk:** The overall risk is minimal; the highest is 0.1 in one report, but even that is very low.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a static, well-structured type stub for AWS SDK.\n- No dynamic code, network calls, or data flows involving untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The future copyright year appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering the placeholder anomaly, but that is negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
