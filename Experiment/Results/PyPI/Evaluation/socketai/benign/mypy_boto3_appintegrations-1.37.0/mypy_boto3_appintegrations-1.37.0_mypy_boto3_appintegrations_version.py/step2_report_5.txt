  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores align with the findings, and if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple version assignment.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, static, and contains no external data handling or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are 0, also appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippet matches the description: a copyright comment and a static version string assigned to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or external data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data flow pathways.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning that this code is benign and serves solely as metadata is sound.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are introduced by such a version declaration.\n\n### Any Potential Overestimation or Underestimation?\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard version string assignment with no suspicious or malicious elements. The comments and structure are typical for version declaration files in open source projects. No external data, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, and no security concerns are warranted.",
