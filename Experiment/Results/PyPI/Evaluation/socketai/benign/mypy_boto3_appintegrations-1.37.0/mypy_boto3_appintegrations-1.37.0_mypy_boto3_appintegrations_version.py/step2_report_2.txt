  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data flows, no dynamic code, and no obfuscation.\n   - No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The summaries appropriately dismiss any suspicion, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is a static version string, with no external inputs, no execution, and no malicious indicators.\n   - No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n   - This is consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all analyses are straightforward.\n   - The code's simplicity makes such claims unnecessary.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, I concur with the provided scores. The code serves solely as a version identifier, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scoring. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
