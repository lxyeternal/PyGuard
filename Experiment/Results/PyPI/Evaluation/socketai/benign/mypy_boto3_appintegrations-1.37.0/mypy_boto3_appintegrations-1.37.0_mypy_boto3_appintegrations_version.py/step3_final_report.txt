  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. No input/output, dynamic code, obfuscation, or external dependencies are present. The code serves solely as metadata. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence (1). The logic is consistent, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
