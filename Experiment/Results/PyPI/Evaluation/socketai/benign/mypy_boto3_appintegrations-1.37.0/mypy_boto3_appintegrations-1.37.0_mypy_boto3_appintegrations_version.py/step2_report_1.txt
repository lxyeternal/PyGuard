  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`\"1.37.0\"`) to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code includes only a copyright comment and a version string assignment.\n   - No input/output operations, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws:**\n   - The code is minimal and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No vulnerabilities or security flaws are evident, nor are there assumptions or speculative claims.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the reports correctly interpret the code as safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall,** the code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's simplicity.",
