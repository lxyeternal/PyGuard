{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 appintegrations paginators, facilitating static type checking and structured API interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters (**kwargs) passed to paginate() functions, and from imported type definitions and system version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is transmitted externally; the code only forwards kwargs to boto3's paginator methods, which handle API requests internally.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into the paginate() methods, which unpack them into request types and invoke the superclass paginate(), returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes inheriting from boto3's Paginator, with conditional import of Unpack based on Python version. The paginate() methods accept kwargs, unpack into request types, and call the base paginate(), returning PageIterator objects. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code is detected. The code is a standard SDK type stub designed for static type checking, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator wrappers for boto3's appintegrations service. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is safe for use. The acceptance of kwargs is standard in SDK wrappers and does not introduce risk. Overall, it is safe, non-malicious, and appropriate for its purpose.",
