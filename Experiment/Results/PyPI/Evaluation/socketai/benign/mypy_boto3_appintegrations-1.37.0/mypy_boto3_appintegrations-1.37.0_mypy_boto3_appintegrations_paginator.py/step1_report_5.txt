  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the appintegrations service client, enabling typed pagination over various list operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules (sys, typing, botocore.paginate, type_defs), and within class methods through **kwargs which are passed to the paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The code uses **kwargs for pagination parameters; these are passed directly to the underlying paginator methods without modification, representing safe, controlled data flow. No untrusted input handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from method calls (paginate) receiving external parameters (**kwargs) to the invocation of Paginator's paginate method, returning PageIterator objects for iterating over paginated responses.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. The code structure follows standard pattern for boto3 paginators with conditional imports based on Python version. No suspicious dynamic execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginator classes for boto3 appintegrations, using type hints and conditional imports for compatibility. All methods simply call the base Paginator's paginate method with passed parameters, with no processing of untrusted data or hidden behaviors. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network operations, file access, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be a well-structured, type-safe wrapper for paginators, intended for SDK users. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured, type-annotated wrapper around boto3 paginators for the appintegrations service. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to provide typed access to existing SDK pagination mechanisms.",
