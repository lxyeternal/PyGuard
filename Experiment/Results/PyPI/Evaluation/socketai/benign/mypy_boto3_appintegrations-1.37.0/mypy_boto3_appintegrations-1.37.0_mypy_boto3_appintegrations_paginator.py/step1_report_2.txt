{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 appintegrations service, facilitating pagination with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters and return types; conditionally imported Unpack; class inheritance from Paginator.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods invoke superclass methods; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points are evident; no external network or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "User code calls get_paginator, then paginate with kwargs, which delegates to superclass methods returning PageIterator objects; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks inside this module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is mainly structural and type annotation definitions for boto3 pagination classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS appintegrations using boto3, with careful type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. No external data processing, network calls, or system modifications are present within this code. It is a typical SDK wrapper structure aimed at providing type safety and clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects. The code appears to be a benign, well-structured type hinting module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK helper module focused on type annotations and paginator class definitions. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
