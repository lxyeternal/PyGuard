{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 appintegrations service client to facilitate paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; dynamic imports of Unpack based on Python version; class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code defines classes and functions that wrap existing boto3 paginator functionality without handling untrusted input or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from type imports and conditional imports to class definitions with paginate methods, which invoke base class paginate methods with type unpacking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured type annotation wrappers around boto3 paginators. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up typed paginator classes for AWS appintegrations service using boto3. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >=3.12, defines base classes with proper type annotations, and implements paginate methods that simply forward calls to the base class. No external data handling, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The structure and purpose align with standard SDK type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured set of type annotations and class wrappers intended to enhance type safety and documentation clarity for boto3 paginators. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
