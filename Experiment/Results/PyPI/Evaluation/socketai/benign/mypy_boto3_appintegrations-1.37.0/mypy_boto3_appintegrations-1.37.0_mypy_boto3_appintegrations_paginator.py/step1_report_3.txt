  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginators for the AWS appintegrations service client in boto3 with static type checking support.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, sys.version_info check for importing Unpack, class method parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input directly, no external data sinks such as network calls or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code includes comprehensive type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility, which are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type annotation and paginator class definitions for boto3. It imports modules safely, defines classes with appropriate type annotations, and uses conditional imports for compatibility with Python >= 3.12. There are no suspicious dynamic code execution, external network interactions, or hidden backdoors. It adheres to good static typing practices and documentation links, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured module for defining paginators with type hints for AWS SDK. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate, intended for type checking and paginator structure in boto3.",
