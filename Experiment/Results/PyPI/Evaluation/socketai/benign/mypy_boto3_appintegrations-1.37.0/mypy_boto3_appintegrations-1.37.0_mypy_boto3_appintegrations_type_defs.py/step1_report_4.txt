  "purpose": "Type definitions for appintegrations service data structures, used for API request/response schemas.",
  "sources": "Constantly imported modules and type annotations, primarily for type hinting and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code only defines data types.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing are evident; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward type annotation and class definitions, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines type aliases, TypedDicts, and imports for static type checking, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No runtime logic, user input processing, or external data handling is implemented. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is detected. The presence of future import and version checks are standard practice for type hinting compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API client, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is unlikely to pose a security risk.",
