{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and documentation for the appintegrations service in a Python SDK, facilitating type hints and data structure validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and type definitions, constant tuples, and module-level documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No execution of untrusted input, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines data structures and type annotations without runtime logic or data flow controls.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python SDK module, utilizing modern type hinting practices, conditional imports based on Python version, and clear structure. No code executes untrusted data, no network or file I/O is present, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The presence of detailed documentation and adherence to standard type declaration patterns suggest it is a well-formed SDK component rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of type definitions intended for SDK data validation and documentation. No signs of malware or security threats are detected.",
