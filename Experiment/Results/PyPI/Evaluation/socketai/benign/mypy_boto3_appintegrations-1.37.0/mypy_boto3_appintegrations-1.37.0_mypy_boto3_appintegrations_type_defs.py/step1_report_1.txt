{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for appintegrations service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Code primarily reads static type definitions, imports from standard and third-party modules, and loads type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external interactions are present; the code only defines data types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code contains a copyright date in 2025, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party typing modules, uses conditional imports based on Python version, and defines numerous TypedDict classes representing structured data. It includes type unions and optional fields, and no functions or runtime behaviors are present. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure aligns with typical SDK or API client type definitions. The presence of a future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for an AWS-like service SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines data structures and types for use in other code. No supply chain threats or malicious patterns are present.",
