{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the appintegrations service, facilitating type safety and clarity in SDK or client code.",
  "sources": "The code sources include imports from standard libraries, conditional imports based on Python version, and definitions of TypedDicts that specify data schemas and API request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external interactions are present; the code primarily defines data types and structures.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining data schemas and type annotations without executing logic or data processing. There are no data flows involving untrusted input leading to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is straightforward type definitions with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type definitions for an SDK or client library related to appintegrations. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, ensuring compatibility. All classes are TypedDicts specifying data schemas for API requests, responses, and configurations. There are no functions, dynamic code, or external interactions that could be exploited. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The code appears to be purely declarative and intended for type safety, with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definitions module for an SDK, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. It serves as a structured schema for data exchange and does not perform any operations or contain exploitable code.",
