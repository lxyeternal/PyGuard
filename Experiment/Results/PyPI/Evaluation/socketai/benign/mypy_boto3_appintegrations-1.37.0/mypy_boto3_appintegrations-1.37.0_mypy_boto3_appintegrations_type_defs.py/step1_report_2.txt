{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for appintegrations service for use with boto3, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially sys.version_info checks, and type aliasing from typing and typing_extensions modules; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions; no code executes or data is sent or received.",
  "flows": "None, as this module solely defines types and does not process data or perform actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the entire module is static type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network operations present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The initial import section manages compatibility but does not perform any operations that could be malicious. All functions and type definitions are standard for type hinting and do not include any malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type definitions intended for use with boto3 for appintegrations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only notable aspect is careful version-based conditional imports, which is standard practice for compatibility. Overall, the module appears safe and free from malicious intent.",
