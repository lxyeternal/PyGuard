  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- It includes no functions, runtime logic, or data processing.\n- The content is static, purely declarative, serving as type hints and data schemas for an SDK or API client.\n- There are no external interactions, data sinks, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- The copyright date in 2025 is unusual but not malicious; it could be a placeholder or future-dated placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for appintegrations SDK.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no code injection, no external data flow.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. The code is standard type definitions, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Type definitions for boto3 appintegrations.  \n- Findings: No external input, no dynamic code, no malicious patterns.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Conclusion:** Correct. The code is static type annotations, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for SDK schemas.  \n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external interactions, no malicious patterns.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Conclusion:** Valid. The code is purely data schemas, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type definitions and documentation.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscated code.  \n- Noted: Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the future date, but this is not malicious.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (acceptable given context)  \n**Conclusion:** The presence of a future date is not malicious; the code remains safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: SDK type definitions.  \n- Findings: No malicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Conclusion:** Correct. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code. The code is purely static type definitions.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports find obfuscation; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the static nature, no runtime code, no external data flow, and no secrets, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**However,** the only minor point is the future date (2025) in the copyright, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to the future date anomaly, which is not a security threat)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for an SDK or API client. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe and aligns with typical SDK type definition patterns.",
