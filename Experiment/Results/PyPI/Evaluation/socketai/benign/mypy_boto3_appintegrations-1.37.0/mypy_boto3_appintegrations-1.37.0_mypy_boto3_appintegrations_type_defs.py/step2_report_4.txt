  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the validity of their conclusions and the scores assigned, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines static type annotations for an SDK, primarily importing modules and defining TypedDicts.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling; no runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** The copyright date is 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to Report 1, focuses on static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; only version-based imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; type definitions for API schemas.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; only static type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Sound; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1 — the security risk is slightly above zero but justified by the future date, which is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the future date anomaly. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; type definitions and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Future copyright date again, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in report 4 (0.1) due to the future date, which is a benign anomaly. This is justified and reasonable.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High across all reports; no contradictions.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type definitions for an SDK or API client.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright date, which is benign.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to the future date anomaly)\n\nThese are consistent with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content. The slight security risk score reflects an anomaly but does not indicate any threat. The overall assessment confirms that this supply chain component poses no security threat.",
