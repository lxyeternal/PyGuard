{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations and data schemas for the appintegrations SDK, serving as type hints and data definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, and TypedDict class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The only notable anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which does not impact security. The code is standard for SDK schema definitions and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which is not a security concern.",
