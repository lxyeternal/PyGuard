  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a static type definition module with no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set in 2025, which is unconventional but not malicious.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions. No dynamic code, external interactions, or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence (0.9) seems appropriate given the static nature of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is justified.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 is reasonable, as there's no evident security concern.  \n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is purely static type definitions with no external interactions or malicious patterns. The confidence is even higher (1).  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct. The code only contains type annotations, conditional imports, and data schemas. No runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious activity is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is static type definitions, with no malicious behavior or security risks. Emphasizes that the code is declarative, with no functions or dynamic code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's purpose is to define data schemas for an SDK, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, reasonable.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting that the code is static type annotations, with no external interactions or malicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025).  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic or data processing. The security risk score is noted as 0.1, which is slightly above zero, perhaps due to the future date, but this is not a security concern.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 seems acceptable given the future date anomaly, but overall, the code remains low risk.  \n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a well-structured set of type definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), possibly due to the lack of runtime logic or the detailed documentation string.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code content. The code is static, standard for SDK type definitions, and contains no malicious patterns.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0. Given the code's nature as static type definitions, this is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with one report (number 4) assigning 0.1 due to the future copyright date. This is reasonable, but the date alone does not pose a security risk.  \n- **Confidence Levels:** Appropriately high, reflecting the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Assessment & My Estimates**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across the board, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, as the code is purely static type definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK or API client, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**  \n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, purely static type definitions.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.",
