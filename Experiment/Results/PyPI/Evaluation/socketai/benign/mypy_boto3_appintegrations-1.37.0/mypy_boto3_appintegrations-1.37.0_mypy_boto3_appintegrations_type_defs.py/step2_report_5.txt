  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for appintegrations SDK.\n- Findings: Static type definitions, no runtime code, no external interactions, no secrets.\n- Anomalies: Future copyright date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk: 0 — no security issues detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard type definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The future date is noted but not problematic.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for boto3's appintegrations.\n- Findings: Import statements, version-based conditional imports, no dynamic code or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; standard practice.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence: 1 — full confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code as static type definitions, with no malicious elements.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for SDK data schemas.\n- Findings: Import statements, conditional imports, no runtime logic, no external data handling.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; standard pattern.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — no issues.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is purely declarative, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for API schemas.\n- Findings: Imports, type annotations, no data sinks or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: Future copyright date (2025), but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0 — aligns.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — slightly elevated, but the code is just static types.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the minimal concern; no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Documentation and type definitions.\n- Findings: Import statements, no runtime code, no external data handling.\n- Anomalies: Future date (2025), but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is a standard SDK type definition module with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.\n- Malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- Security risks are minimal or zero, aligning with the static nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code contains no executable logic, no data processing, no external system interactions, and no secrets.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.\n- The presence of a future date is likely a placeholder or a mistake but not malicious.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments in the reports.** The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for an SDK or API client, with no malicious or security concerns.",
