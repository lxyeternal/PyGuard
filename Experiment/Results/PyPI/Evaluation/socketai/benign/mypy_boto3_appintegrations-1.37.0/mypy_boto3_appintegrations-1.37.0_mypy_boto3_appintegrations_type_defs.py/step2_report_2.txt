  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes static type definitions for an SDK, with no dynamic code or external data sources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or data flows involving untrusted sources.  \n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set in 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely type annotations and data structures, standard for SDKs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0, as expected for static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type definitions for boto3 SDK.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external interactions or data processing; purely static type annotations.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; only version-based conditional imports, which are standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, static data schemas for SDK/API.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or runtime logic.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies aside from the future year (2025) in the copyright.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward type definitions, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for SDK, with standard imports and annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.  \n- **Anomalies:** Future date (2025) in the copyright, but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation; purely static type info.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, but still negligible and likely just a conservative estimate due to the future date).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Documentation and type definitions, no runtime logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** Future year (2025) in the copyright, but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a well-structured SDK type definition module, with no malicious patterns.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The occasional mention of the future year (2025) is likely just an error or placeholder, not malicious. I would assign a **malware score of 0** across the board, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward, static type definitions. **Obfuscated score of 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the total absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities, the overall security risk remains extremely low. The slightly elevated risk estimate (0.1) in one report is likely due to the future date, which is not a security concern. I would set the **risk score at 0**.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the nature of the code as static, well-structured SDK type definitions with no malicious intent.",
