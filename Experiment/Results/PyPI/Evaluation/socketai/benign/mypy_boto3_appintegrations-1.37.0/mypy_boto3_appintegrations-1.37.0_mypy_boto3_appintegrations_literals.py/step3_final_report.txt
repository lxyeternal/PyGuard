  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS SDK constants, including service names, resource names, regions, and paginator identifiers, to support type checking and IDE features.",
  "sources": "Definition of string literals for various AWS services, regions, resource identifiers, and paginator names; no runtime data or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any runtime operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or execution path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward static type definitions with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations using Python's Literal types, defining constants for AWS SDK components. It includes conditional import for compatibility with Python versions >= 3.12. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, network calls, or user inputs. The extensive list of literals is typical for static type support and documentation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors are present. The purpose is to improve static analysis, IDE support, and documentation. All observed signals indicate benign, static code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is appropriate for its intended purpose. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are accurate and should remain at 0.",
