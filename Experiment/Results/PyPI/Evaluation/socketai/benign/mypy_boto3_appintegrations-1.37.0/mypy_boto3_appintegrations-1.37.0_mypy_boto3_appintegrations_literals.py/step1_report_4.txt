  "purpose": "Define type literals for the appintegrations service and other AWS services, regions, and paginator names for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Type annotation assignments, imports, and string literals defining various AWS-related constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines static type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for various AWS services, regions, and paginator names. These are static type annotations meant for type safety and do not execute any operations or perform data processing. No code manipulates or handles untrusted input, nor does it establish network connections or access sensitive data. The purpose is to support static type checking and documentation. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static definition of string literal types used for type annotations related to AWS services. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
