{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for the AWS appintegrations service and related constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing (or typing_extensions), and assigns string literal types to various variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - static type definitions with no runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be type annotations and documentation, with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS SDK service names, resource names, pagination identifiers, and regions. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. The extensive list of literals seems to be used for static type safety, documentation, and code clarity. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or external inputs. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and documentation links intended for static type checking and code clarity in AWS SDK usage. No malicious or security risk behavior is detected.",
