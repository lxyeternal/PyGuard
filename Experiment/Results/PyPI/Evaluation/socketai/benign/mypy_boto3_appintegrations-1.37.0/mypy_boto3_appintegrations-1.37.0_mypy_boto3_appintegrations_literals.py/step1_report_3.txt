  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS appintegrations service and related constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; assignments of various Literal type variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is mainly static type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type alias declarations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version to define Literal types. It only declares constants with string literals for type annotations, which is a common pattern for specifying allowed string values for AWS SDK parameters. There are no functions, input/output, or dynamic behaviors. The presence of extensive string literals may seem verbose but are benign in this context. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident. All elements are static definitions for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type literal definitions intended for type hinting in AWS SDK usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
