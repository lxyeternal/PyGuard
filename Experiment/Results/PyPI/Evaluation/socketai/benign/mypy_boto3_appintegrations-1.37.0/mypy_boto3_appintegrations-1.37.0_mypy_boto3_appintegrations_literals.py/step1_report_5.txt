{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in boto3 stubs related to AWS AppIntegrations and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and string literals; no external data sources or user input processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The license and documentation comments are standard and do not pose risks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type definitions using Python's Literal types, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No input handling, no external network calls, no file operations, and no code execution features are present. All literals are predefined strings for AWS resource names, service names, regions, and paginator names, which are typical in SDK type stubs. The license comment indicates copyright but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS SDK stubs, with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It simply provides type annotations for better static analysis and IDE support.",
