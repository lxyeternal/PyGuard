{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK service and resource identifiers, paginator names, and other constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code primarily declares type aliases and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or execute data flow paths.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; standard pattern for defining string literal types with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, then defines various string literal types representing AWS service names, paginator names, resource names, and regions. It only consists of static type annotations and constants. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, no code injection, or data leaks. The purpose is to provide type safety for AWS SDK interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type definitions module intended to facilitate static type checking in AWS SDK usage. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks.",
