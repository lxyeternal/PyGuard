  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details for a boto3-related package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; sys.argv is read for command-line arguments",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic; straightforward CLI output functions",
  "analysis": "The script defines simple functions to print static package information and version details based on command-line input. It reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs data via sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or network communications. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure and content are minimal and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The code is benign and safe to use.",
