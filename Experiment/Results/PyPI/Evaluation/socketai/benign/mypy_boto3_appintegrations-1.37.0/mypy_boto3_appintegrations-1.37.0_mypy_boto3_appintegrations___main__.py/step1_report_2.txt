  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), sys.argv (reads command-line arguments)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that provides version and package info. It reads command-line input via sys.argv and outputs data through sys.stdout.write. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. It performs simple input/output operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
