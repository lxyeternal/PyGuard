  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing informational output about boto3 AppIntegrationsService.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes to stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() outputs data; sys.argv is read for command-line inputs.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version(), which outputs version info. Otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no unusual or obfuscated behavior. No external network access or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility. It reads command-line arguments to determine output. The functions print static package info and version details, which are hardcoded. The code uses standard library functions without any suspicious or malicious operations. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility that provides package information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
