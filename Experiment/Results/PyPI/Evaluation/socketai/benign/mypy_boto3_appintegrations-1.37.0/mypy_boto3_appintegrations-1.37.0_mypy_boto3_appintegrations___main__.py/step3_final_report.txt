  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info or version",
  "flows": "sys.argv input triggers print_info or print_version output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static CLI script that reads command-line arguments and outputs predefined information. It contains no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious intent are present, and the code's purpose is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with its behavior. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
