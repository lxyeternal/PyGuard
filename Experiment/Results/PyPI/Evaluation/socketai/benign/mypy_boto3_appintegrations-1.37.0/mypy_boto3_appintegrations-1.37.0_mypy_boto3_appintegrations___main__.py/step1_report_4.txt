  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, outputs to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "targets": "Outputs data to stdout, no untrusted data sinks or external connections.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() is called; both output static info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI logic, printing static package info and version. No external calls, no user data processing, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code does not contain any malicious intent or malicious payloads. No flow of untrusted data to dangerous sinks; all outputs are static strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. No malicious or security risks are present.",
