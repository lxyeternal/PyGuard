  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility.\n- It provides static package info and version info.\n- It responds to the `--version` argument.\n- It uses straightforward functions with no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no credentials, no backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code is very simple and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- It performs static output based on command-line arguments.\n- No errors, flaws, or security issues are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, no malicious behavior, and straightforward functionality.\n- They correctly identify the code as a simple CLI utility with static outputs.\n- No flawed reasoning or misinterpretation is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n- The code is static, benign, and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- This is correct; no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n- No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessments are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- All reports' scores are consistent with their analysis and the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility with static outputs.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n**Overall:** The code is benign, safe, and free of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
