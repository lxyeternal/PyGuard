  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` for input and `sys.stdout.write` for output.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n   - The functions are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious logic.\n   - The code is benign, safe, and designed solely for informational output.\n\n2. **Review of Reports**:\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as a simple, benign CLI utility.\n   - They mention no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No suspicious claims or assumptions are made.\n   - The scores seem appropriate and reasonable.\n\n5. **My Own Assessment**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion**: The code is a straightforward, benign CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
