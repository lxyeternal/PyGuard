  "flows": "No data flow; class definition does not involve runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no unusual or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It contains only a docstring and a pass statement, with no additional logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
