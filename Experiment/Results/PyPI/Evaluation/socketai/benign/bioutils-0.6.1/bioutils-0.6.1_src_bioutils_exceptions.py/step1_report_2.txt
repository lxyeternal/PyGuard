  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to bioutils library",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used or read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only declares an exception class",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition",
  "analysis": "This code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no suspicious or malicious components, no data handling, and no complex logic involved. It appears to be a standard practice for creating specific exceptions within a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
