  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to bioutils.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class declaration does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception subclass with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It serves as a root exception for bioutils-related errors, with no additional logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The simplicity and clarity suggest it's a standard pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
