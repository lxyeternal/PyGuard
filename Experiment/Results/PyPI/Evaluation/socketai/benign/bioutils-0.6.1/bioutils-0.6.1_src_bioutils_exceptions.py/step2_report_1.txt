  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The class contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are identified.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks**:\n   - The reports unanimously state that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security issues.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions strongly suggest no hidden malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports give 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports give 0, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports give 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Any Logical Flaws or Mistakes?**:\n   - The reports are accurate; the code is a standard custom exception class with no security concerns.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent functionality.\n   - The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Potential Score Adjustments**:\n   - Since all evidence points to a benign, straightforward class, the current scores seem appropriate.\n   - No reason to increase malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The risk score remains at 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The analysis confirms that this code is benign and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity.",
