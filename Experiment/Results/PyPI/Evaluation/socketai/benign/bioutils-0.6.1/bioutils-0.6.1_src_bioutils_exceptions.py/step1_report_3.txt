  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to bioinformatics utilities",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class definition with no unusual or suspicious features; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception class, intended for specific error handling within a bioinformatics utility library. It contains no data input, no code execution, and no malicious behavior. It is a minimal, standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a typical purpose of defining a custom exception class. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
