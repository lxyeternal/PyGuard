  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`. The code contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is benign and standard.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic.**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class with no malicious intent or security issues. No errors or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue.**  \n- Confidence is 1 in all reports, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.  \n- Obfuscated is 0, which is correct.  \n- Malware is 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- Security risk is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nSince all reports clearly state that the code is benign, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the overall security risk should remain at 0. The code does not perform any suspicious operations, nor does it contain hidden behaviors.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores.**  \nAll reports assign malware score 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \nThe reports are cautious and do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency of scores with the report content.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis provided. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code correctness:**  \nThe code is a standard custom exception class, with no issues.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n0, as there is no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n0, no obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n0, no security risk.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe, and standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is correct and benign.  \n- No issues or malicious activity are present.  \n- The scores provided are appropriate; I concur with them.  \n- Final recommended scores:  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0",
