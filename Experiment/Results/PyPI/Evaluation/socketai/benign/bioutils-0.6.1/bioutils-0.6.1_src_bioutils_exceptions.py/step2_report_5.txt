  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - No report claims or implies any hidden or malicious intent, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5. All are at 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no malicious or risky features, this is justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign class definition.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - The high confidence and zero scores for obfuscation, malware, and security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0** — no security risk present.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code's purpose is purely to define a custom exception class, which is a common pattern in Python.\n- No changes are necessary; the current assessments are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action or adjustment is needed.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
