  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to bioutils operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple class definition with no anomalies; it does not contain any malicious behavior or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'BioutilsError' inheriting from 'Exception'. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and a 'pass' statement, which indicates an empty class body. There are no operations, input/output, data handling, or external interactions that could suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard pattern for creating custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and benign class definition for a custom exception, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
