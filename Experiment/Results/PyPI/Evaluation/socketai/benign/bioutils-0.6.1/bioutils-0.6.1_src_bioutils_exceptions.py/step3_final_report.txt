  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for bioutils-related errors.",
  "sources": "Class definition inheriting from Exception, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the class contains only a pass statement and a docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from Exception with only a docstring and pass. All reports confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No external data handling, input/output, or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the clarity and minimalism of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
