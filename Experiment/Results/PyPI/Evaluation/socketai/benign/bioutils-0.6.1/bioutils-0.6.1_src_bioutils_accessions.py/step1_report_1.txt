{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling biological identifiers, including parsing, inferring, and formatting accession numbers and chromosome labels.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include accession strings for identifiers and chromosome labels for formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects; functions mainly return formatted strings or perform regex matches.",
  "flows": "The functions flow from input strings (accession numbers, chromosome labels) through regex-based inference or formatting to output strings; no external system calls or data transmissions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains detailed regex patterns for identifier matching, but no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials. License comments are standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines regex patterns for various biological identifier schemes, such as Ensembl, RefSeq, UniProt, and INSDC. It includes functions to infer and prepend namespaces, convert chromosome labels to standard form, and strip 'chr' prefixes. All functions perform string manipulations and regex matching; no external calls or sensitive operations are present. The code appears well-structured, with clear purpose and no anomalous behaviors. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for biological data formatting and inference, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external system interactions or contain obfuscated or suspicious code. The functions are safe and serve standard bioinformatics purposes.",
