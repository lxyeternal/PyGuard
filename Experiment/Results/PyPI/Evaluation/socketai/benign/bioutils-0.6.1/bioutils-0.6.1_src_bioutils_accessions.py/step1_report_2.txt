{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling biological identifiers, such as parsing, inferring, and formatting accession strings, especially for genomic data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments (e.g., accession strings, chromosome identifiers) and internally processes regex patterns for classification and inference.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of regex matching for input validation and the raising of exceptions for invalid input. No untrusted data is directly sent over networks or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to functions like infer_namespace, coerce_namespace, chr22XY, prepend_chr, strip_chr, and their outputs are used within logical flows to determine identifiers and formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The regex patterns are standard for biological identifiers, and there are no hidden backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration code. The code comments and licensing are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs pattern matching and string formatting based on known biological data standards. It compiles regex patterns for various identifier formats, includes functions for normalizing chromosome labels, and infers namespaces from identifiers. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. Exception handling is limited to expected validation errors. All operations are standard utility functions with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for biological identifier handling. It contains no malware or malicious behavior, does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration, and adheres to typical validation and formatting practices. It is safe for use.",
