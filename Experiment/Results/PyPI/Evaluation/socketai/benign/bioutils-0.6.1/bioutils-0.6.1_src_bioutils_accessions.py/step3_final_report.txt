  "purpose": "Utility functions for biological identifiers, including regex-based validation, namespace inference, and chromosome formatting.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for identifier schemes, string inputs for identifiers and chromosome labels.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched against regex patterns; functions format or infer namespaces based on matches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Regex patterns are standard for domain-specific validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward regex matching, string formatting, and namespace inference for biological data. No external system interactions or malicious code are present. Regex patterns are domain-specific and do not pose security risks. Functions are well-structured and readable, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal security risk arises from regex complexity, but it is negligible given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, domain-specific utility module for biological identifier handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
