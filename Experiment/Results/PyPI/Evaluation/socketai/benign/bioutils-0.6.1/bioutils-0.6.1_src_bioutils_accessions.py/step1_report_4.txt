{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling biological identifiers, chromosomes, and namespaces, primarily for data validation and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads string inputs for identifiers, chromosome labels, and namespace inference.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network or file operations; the code manipulates string data only.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through functions like coerce_namespace, infer_namespace, chr22XY, prepend_chr, and strip_chr, with regex matching for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The only potentially unusual aspect is the extensive use of regex patterns for namespace inference, which appears legitimate and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for validating biological accession identifiers across various namespaces, and functions for inferring and coercing these namespaces based on input. The chr22XY and related functions manipulate chromosome labels for consistency. There are no network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated code constructs. The regex patterns match known biological identifier formats and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward, focusing on string parsing and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for biological data processing. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and no security risks are evident. Its purpose is data validation and formatting within expected biological identifier schemas.",
