{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling biological identifiers, including inferring namespaces, formatting chromosome labels, and processing accession strings.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for identifying accession namespaces; input parameters for functions such as accession strings and chromosome identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or process untrusted data directly to sensitive locations or network interfaces; primarily processes strings and regex matching.",
  "flows": "Input data (accession strings, chromosome labels) are processed through regex matching and string manipulation functions without data transmission or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code mainly performs pattern matching and string formatting using regex and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for common biological identifiers and functions to infer or prepend namespace and chromosome prefixes. It uses regex matching to identify accession types and to infer their namespaces. The functions are straightforward, with no apparent data leaks, network access, or malicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious side effects. The only notable aspect is the detailed regex patterns, which are consistent with identifier formats and do not pose security concerns. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for biological identifier processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs pattern matching, string formatting, and namespace inference, which are common and safe operations. No malware or security issues are evident.",
