  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for biological identifiers, no external data or system calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String manipulations and regex matching, no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. Regex patterns are standard for biological data.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured utility code with no malware or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, mainly regex-based classification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission, just string processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard regex for biological identifiers.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, domain-specific utility functions, no malware or security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—identifier parsing and formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String manipulations, regex matching, no external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, regex patterns are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, domain-appropriate utility code, no security concerns.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, regex-based inference.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String processing, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, regex is standard, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no malware or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 (slightly higher but still negligible).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, with regex for identifier validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String manipulations, no external effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard regex.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard bioinformatics utility functions, no malware or security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward utility functions for biological data handling—parsing, formatting, and inference.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The only slight concern is the regex-based inference, but these are standard patterns, and no external or insecure operations are performed.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The given scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: very low) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1-0.2 (minimal, due to regex complexity but no real security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the regex patterns, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a set of standard, domain-specific utility functions for biological data processing. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as such.",
