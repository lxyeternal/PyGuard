{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling biological identifiers, including parsing, inferring namespaces, and formatting chromosome labels.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments such as accession strings, chromosome identifiers, and other string inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the use of inputs in regex matching and string manipulation, but no direct data sinks (e.g., network, file, environment variable) are used with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data (accessions, chromosome identifiers) flow through functions like infer_namespace, coerce_namespace, chr22XY, prepend_chr, and strip_chr, with no dangerous operations like code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard regex matching and string formatting, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical bioinformatics utility operations such as inferring namespaces from accession strings, formatting chromosome identifiers, and validating input formats with regex. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or file operations involving untrusted data. The regex patterns are static, well-defined, and intended for pattern matching. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present. The functions are consistent with their documented purposes and do not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of safe utility functions for biological identifier processing. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, domain-specific code with no malicious payloads.",
