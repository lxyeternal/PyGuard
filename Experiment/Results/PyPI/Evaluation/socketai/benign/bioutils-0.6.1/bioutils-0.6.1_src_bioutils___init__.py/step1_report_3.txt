  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the current package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata functions, __package__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or external communications",
  "flows": "Calls to version(__package__) retrieve package version; exception handling sets __version__ to None",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No unusual code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the package version using importlib.metadata's version function with __package__ as input. If the package is not found, it catches PackageNotFoundError and sets __version__ to None. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard library functions with proper exception handling. No indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard method to determine a package's version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is clear and safe.",
