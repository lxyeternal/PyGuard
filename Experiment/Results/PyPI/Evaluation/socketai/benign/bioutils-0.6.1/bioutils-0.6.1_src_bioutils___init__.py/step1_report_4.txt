{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of __package__ to determine the package name, and calls version(__package__) to get its version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; the code only accesses package metadata.",
  "flows": "The source is __package__, which provides the package name; the flow leads to version(__package__) to obtain version info, handled within a try-except block.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward metadata query with minimal complexity; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports PackageNotFoundError and version from importlib.metadata. It attempts to retrieve the version of the current package using __package__ as the package name. If the package is not found, it sets __version__ to None. This is a standard pattern for obtaining package version info with proper error handling. No external data inputs, network communication, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code is minimal and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility to get the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
