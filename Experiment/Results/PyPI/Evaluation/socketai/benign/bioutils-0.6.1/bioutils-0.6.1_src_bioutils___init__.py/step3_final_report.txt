{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the current package's version number using importlib.metadata, handling the case where the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Reads __package__ to identify the package name; calls importlib.metadata.version() with __package__ as argument.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations involved.",
  "flows": "Source (__package__) -> version() -> exception handling -> __version__ assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard pattern for retrieving package version info, with proper exception handling for PackageNotFoundError. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The use of __package__ is typical in package modules; potential edge case if __package__ is None does not impact security. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure. It performs a simple task without any malicious intent or security risks. The previous reports correctly identified this, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
