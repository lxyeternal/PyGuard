  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package if installed.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata's version function, __package__ variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "version(__package__) retrieves package version; exceptions handle missing package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code structures, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the current package's version using importlib.metadata's version(). It handles PackageNotFoundError gracefully by setting __version__ to None. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The code is straightforward, standard practice for obtaining package version info, and does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe utility to retrieve package version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
