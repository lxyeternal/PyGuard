  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: retrieving the current package's version via `importlib.metadata.version(__package__)` with exception handling for `PackageNotFoundError`.\n- The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and handles the \"package not installed\" case gracefully.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n**Does the code contain any issues?**\n- No. The code is minimal, correct, and safe.\n- The use of `__package__` as input to `version()` is standard for package version retrieval.\n- Exception handling is appropriate.\n\n**Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**\n- No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The reasoning is consistent, and no false positives are evident.\n\n**Are the scores assigned reasonable?**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores Justification:\n- **Risk score (securityRisk):** 0 is appropriate; no security vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code relies on `__package__`, which is standard in package modules. If used outside a package context, `__package__` might be `None`, but that doesn't introduce security issues.\n- The code does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, standard pattern for retrieving package version info. It is free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports correctly reflect this, and no further action is necessary.",
