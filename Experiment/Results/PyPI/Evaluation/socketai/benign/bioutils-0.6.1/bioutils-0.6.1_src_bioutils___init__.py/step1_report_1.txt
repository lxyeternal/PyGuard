{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the current package if installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __package__ variable to get the package name, and calls version() from importlib.metadata to retrieve package version information.",
  "sinks": "The version() function accesses package metadata; no untrusted data handling or external outputs is directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input: __package__ variable -> Function: version(__package__) -> Output: __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code relies on standard library functions and handles the case where the package is not found gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the version of the current package using importlib.metadata. It handles the PackageNotFoundError exception if the package is not installed, setting __version__ to None. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions, and does not involve any external inputs, network activity, or suspicious operations. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The structure and content are simple and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of retrieving its own package version, with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or malicious anomalies.",
