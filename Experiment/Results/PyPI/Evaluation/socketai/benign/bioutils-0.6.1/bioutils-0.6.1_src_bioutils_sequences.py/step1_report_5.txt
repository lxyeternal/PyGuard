{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, including conversions, complementarity, reverse complement, normalization, and translation of coding sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequences for conversion, normalization, complement, reverse complement, and translation. Uses sequence strings as input in functions like aa_to_aa1, aa_to_aa3, complement, reverse_complement, normalize_sequence, and translate_cds.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed sequences such as amino acid sequences, complements, reverse complements, or normalized strings. No untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed via sequence manipulation functions. For translation, codons are looked up in predefined dictionaries. No flow of data from untrusted sources into dangerous sinks or external systems observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward sequence processing. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations identified. Functionality is consistent with sequence processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs sequence manipulations, including conversion between amino acid representations, sequence normalization, complementarity, reverse complement, and translation of codons. Uses dictionaries for lookup tables, which are standard and secure. No external data fetching, network operations, or dynamic code execution detected. Functions handle None inputs gracefully. No evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or sabotage. The translation functions are well-structured, relying on predefined lookup tables, and do not execute external commands or system calls. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, legitimate utility library for bioinformatics sequence handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sequence utility library with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles sequence transformations securely and transparently. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
