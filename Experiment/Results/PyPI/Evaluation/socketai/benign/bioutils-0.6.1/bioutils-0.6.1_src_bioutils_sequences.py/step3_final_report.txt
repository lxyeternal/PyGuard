{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, including translation, complement, reverse complement, normalization, and sequence conversions, primarily for bioinformatics applications.",
  "sources": "Sequence input strings provided to functions such as translate_cds, complement, reverse_complement, aa_to_aa1, aa_to_aa3, normalize_sequence, replace_t_to_u, replace_u_to_t.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sequence translation functions that process untrusted sequence data; however, they do not execute external code or perform network operations. No data leakage or system effect is evident.",
  "flows": "Sequence strings are input into functions; for translation, codons are read from the sequence and mapped via lookup tables; complement and reverse_complement functions process sequence strings directly; normalization and sequence conversion functions manipulate strings based on static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard bioinformatics utility library with functions for sequence translation, complement, normalization, and conversions. It uses static lookup tables and string operations, with input validation to handle None values. No external dependencies or dynamic code execution are present. The functions handle ambiguous codons gracefully, and the overall design aligns with common practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe bioinformatics utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
