{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for manipulating, translating, and analyzing nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, including conversions, complement, reverse complement, normalization, and translation from CDS to amino acids.",
  "sources": "Reads sequence input from function arguments, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, as well as configuration parameters such as translation table options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed sequences and translations; no direct data leaks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Sequence input (source) flows through functions like normalize_sequence, translate_cds, complement, reverse_complement, and amino acid conversions, leading to outputs; no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard translation tables and sequence manipulations are typical for bioinformatics; no unusual behavior or privacy violations observed. No hidden or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics sequence manipulations: amino acid conversions, sequence normalization, complement, reverse complement, and translation based on well-known codon tables. No external network calls, no file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The functions rely on typical sequence processing techniques with safe data handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate sequence processing library for bioinformatics applications. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions are designed for sequence manipulation and translation, consistent with their intended purpose. No security risks or malware identified.",
