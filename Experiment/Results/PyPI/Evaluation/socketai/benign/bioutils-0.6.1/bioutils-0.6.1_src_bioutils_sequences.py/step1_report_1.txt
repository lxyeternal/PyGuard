{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for converting, analyzing, and manipulating nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, including translation, complement, reverse complement, and sequence normalization.",
  "sources": "Sequence input via function parameters (e.g., seq in translate_cds, complement, reverse_complement, etc.). Sequence data is read within functions like normalize_sequence, translate_cds, and sequence transformation functions.",
  "sinks": "Sequence processing functions where untrusted sequence data could lead to incorrect results or errors. Notably, sequence translation and complement functions manipulate sequence data but do not execute or interpret code or external commands.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed through normalization, translation, or complement functions, transforming sequences within the code. No external or network interactions are performed. The main flow involves sequence transformations without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution observed. The code primarily performs sequence manipulations and conversions using static lookup tables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a sequence utility module with functions for sequence conversion, complement, reverse complement, normalization, and translation. It uses predefined lookup tables for amino acid and nucleotide translations, with options for different translation tables. No external data fetching, network connections, or code execution mechanisms are present. The functions handle untrusted input safely by not executing any code based on input sequences and only performing static transformations. The presence of standard logging and exception handling suggests attention to correctness but not malicious activity. No anomalies indicative of sabotage or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard sequence utility library focused on bioinformatics data manipulation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The functions perform sequence transformations using predefined data and simple string operations. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage within this code fragment.",
