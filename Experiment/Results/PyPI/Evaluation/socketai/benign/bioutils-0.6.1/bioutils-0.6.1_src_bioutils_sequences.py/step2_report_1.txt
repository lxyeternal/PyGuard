  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes that the code is a standard sequence utility library with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The code only performs static data manipulations (lookups, string processing). No external calls, code execution, or network activity. The functions are safe and straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment and scores are reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer finds the code legitimate, standard for bioinformatics, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to the presence of sequence translation functions that could, in theory, be misused if input is malicious. However, the code does not execute code or perform unsafe operations.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are acceptable; the minimal securityRisk score reflects cautiousness but is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the reviewer finds no malicious activity, emphasizing the code's standard sequence processing functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No external dependencies, code execution, or data exfiltration. The functions are deterministic and safe.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion: legitimate bioinformatics utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No external calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer again confirms the code's legitimacy, standard sequence processing functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The functions only manipulate strings and lookup tables; no external or system interactions.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is purely a sequence utility library. It does not execute external code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 in report 2) but still very low, justified by the potential for misuse if input is malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, justified by the possibility of malicious input or misuse, but no actual malicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, safe bioinformatics utility library. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The scores reflect this accurately. No further changes are necessary.",
