  "purpose": "Provides functions for handling nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, including translation, complement, normalization, and format conversion.",
  "sources": "Sequence input parameters in functions such as aa_to_aa1, aa_to_aa3, complement, normalize_sequence, reverse_complement, replace_t_to_u, replace_u_to_t, translate_cds.",
  "sinks": "Sequence processing functions that output transformed sequences; no direct data leaks or system effects detected.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed through normalization, complement, translation, and format conversion functions without any untrusted data reaching system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code contains only sequence manipulations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or external network calls. No signs of malicious privacy violations or data theft. The translation tables are static dictionaries, typical in bioinformatics tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard sequence manipulations such as conversion between amino acid formats, complement calculation, reverse complement, sequence normalization, and translation based on standard codon tables. All operations are deterministic, based on static data and straightforward string processing. The functions include helpful validation and error handling, but no external or untrusted code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The only potentially sensitive aspect is sequence handling, which is benign. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code's structure and content are typical for bioinformatics sequence processing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bioinformatics utility library with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs safe, deterministic sequence processing without external interactions or system modifications.",
