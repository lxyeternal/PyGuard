  "purpose": "Performs a runtime check of Python version and logs a warning if the version is below 3.6.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version info, logging.warning for output",
  "sinks": "logging.warning outputs warning message, no untrusted data flow",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> if condition -> logging.warning",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and warning",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (logging, sys), checks sys.version_info against (3, 6), and logs a warning if the version is lower. It functions as intended without obfuscation, malicious activity, or external data handling. The logic is simple, transparent, and uses standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose is solely informational, and the code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version check that logs a warning for Python versions below 3.6. It poses no security risk or malicious intent. The reports accurately describe its behavior, and the scoring is appropriate. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
