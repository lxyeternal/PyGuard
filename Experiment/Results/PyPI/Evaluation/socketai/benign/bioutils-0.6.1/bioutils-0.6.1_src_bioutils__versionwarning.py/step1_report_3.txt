  "purpose": "Emit a warning when the module is imported under Python versions earlier than 3.6 to inform users about supported Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python interpreter version)",
  "sinks": "Logger warning (logs a warning message)",
  "flows": "Reading sys.version_info -> Logging warning",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; standard version check and logging",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check using sys.version_info. If the Python version is less than 3.6, it logs a warning message via the logging module. No user input, environment variables, or external data are involved. The code is minimal, clear, and intended solely for environment notification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or complex logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply checks the Python version and logs a warning if it is below 3.6. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a version compatibility notice without side effects.",
