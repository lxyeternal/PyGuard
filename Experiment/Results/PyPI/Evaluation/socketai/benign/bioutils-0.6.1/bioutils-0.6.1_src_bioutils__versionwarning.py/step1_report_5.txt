  "purpose": "Issue a warning if the Python version is below 3.6, indicating incompatibility with supported biocommons packages.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version information), _logger.warning (outputs warning message)",
  "sinks": "_logger.warning (outputs to logging system, which could be configured elsewhere to log or transmit data)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → _logger.warning (triggered if version < 3.6)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a simple version check and logs a warning.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the current Python version at runtime. If the version is less than 3.6, it logs a warning message about compatibility. The logging setup appears standard, and no untrusted data input or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal, clear, and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check with a logging warning. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
