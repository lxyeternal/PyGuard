  "purpose": "Issue a warning if the Python version is less than 3.6 to inform users about compatibility limitations.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version information), logging.getLogger (access to logging system)",
  "sinks": "logging.warning (outputs warning message to logs)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> logging.warning (triggered if version < 3.6)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs a standard version check and logs a warning as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python interpreter version at runtime. If the version is below 3.6, it logs a warning message. It uses standard library modules 'logging' and 'sys' without any obfuscated or unusual code. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward and intended solely for compatibility notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, non-malicious, and serves a compatibility warning purpose. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
