  "flows": "sys.version_info check → logging.warning call to emit the warning message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward version check and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and sys modules, defines a warning message, and logs a warning if the Python version is less than 3.6. No user input or external data sources are involved. The code's intent is to notify about compatibility limitations. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. It uses standard library features appropriately for a version check and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version check with logging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It serves a compatibility warning function.",
