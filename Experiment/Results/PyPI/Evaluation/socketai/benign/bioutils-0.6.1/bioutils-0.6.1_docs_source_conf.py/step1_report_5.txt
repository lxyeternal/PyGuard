  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "Constants and list definitions such as project name, extensions list, path strings, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources; no data output or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code contains static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is standard configuration without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static configuration file for Sphinx, with well-known extension lists and path definitions. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code contains only static strings and lists, no external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for setting up documentation build parameters.",
