  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a static Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic or input handling.\n- No network operations, external data fetching, or code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets are visible.\n- All reports agree on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies static configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Same findings:** Static, benign configuration.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes, matching the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same reasoning, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Zero across malware, obfuscated, risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same consistent conclusion.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same analysis, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify the code as benign static configuration with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Any overlooked risks?**  \n  Given the code is purely static configuration, there are no hidden risks. The assessments are sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
