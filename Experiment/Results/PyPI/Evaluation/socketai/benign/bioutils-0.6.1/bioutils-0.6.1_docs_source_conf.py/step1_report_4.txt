  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures present",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation generation. It defines project info, extensions, paths, and themes with no input/output handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx with no malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks identified.",
