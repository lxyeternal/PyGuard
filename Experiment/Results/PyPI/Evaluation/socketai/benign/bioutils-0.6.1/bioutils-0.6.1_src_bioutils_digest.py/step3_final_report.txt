  "purpose": "A utility class for handling cryptographic digest encoding and decoding in base64, base64url, and hex formats, supporting slicing and conversions.",
  "sources": "Bytes input during Digest object creation; static methods accepting string inputs for decoding.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded strings; decoding functions accept untrusted input strings, which could be misused if fed malicious data.",
  "flows": "Bytes are encoded to strings (base64, base64url, hex); strings are decoded back to bytes and Digest objects, potentially from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Digest class for encoding/decoding digest bytes in multiple formats, with methods for conversion and slicing. It uses standard libraries (base64, binascii, hashlib). No external system calls or network activity are present. The decoding functions accept untrusted input, which could be misused but does not in itself constitute malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, clear, and typical for cryptographic utilities. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The test code in __main__ is benign and for demonstration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard digest utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is decoding untrusted input, which is inherent to such utilities but does not imply malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to the decoding of untrusted data. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
