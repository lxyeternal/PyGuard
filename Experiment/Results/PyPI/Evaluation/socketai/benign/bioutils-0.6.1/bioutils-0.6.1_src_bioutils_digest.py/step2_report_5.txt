  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of their claims, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class as a utility for digest encoding/decoding, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks; decoding functions accept untrusted input but do not execute or send data elsewhere.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate. The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (minimal, due to decoding untrusted input), obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class's role. The only dynamic source is the `hashlib.sha512()` in the `__main__` block.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decoding functions could be misused if untrusted input is provided, but the code does not execute or send data elsewhere.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code, just standard decoding. The presence of test code is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The reasoning is sound; the confidence is high (0.9). The securityRisk score of 0.1 reflects minimal risk from decoding untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the class handles digest data with standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or system-level sinks; decoding could be risky if input is malicious, but no harm occurs in the code itself.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns; standard library usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded. The securityRisk score of 0.1 is appropriate given potential decoding of untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class as a digest utility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction; decoding functions are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Usage is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis aligns with the code. The securityRisk of 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard encoding/decoding; no external effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; the securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering decoding untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting potential issues if untrusted input is decoded but no actual harm occurs.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is a standard digest utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — decoding untrusted input could pose minor risks, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The minor security risk score accounts for potential misuse of decoding functions with untrusted data but does not indicate an actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis of all reports.",
