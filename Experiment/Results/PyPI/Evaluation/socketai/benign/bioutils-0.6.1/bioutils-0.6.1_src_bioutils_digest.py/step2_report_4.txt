  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class as a utility for digest encoding/decoding, which matches the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that decoding functions accept untrusted input, but no malicious activity is present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns; standard cryptographic handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes benign nature with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class as handling cryptographic digests with encoding/decoding.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential risks in decoding untrusted strings, but emphasizes no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes the presence of test code in `__main__`, which is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk, with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, considering the decoding of untrusted input but no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly states decoding/encoding as potential sinks, but no external or malicious effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes safe utility.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class as a digest utility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes safe encoding/decoding, no external system effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately benign.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious actions, just encoding/decoding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is a standard digest encoding utility.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** While decoding untrusted input can be risky, the code itself does not perform any dangerous actions. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting potential misuse if the decoded data is used elsewhere.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risks.\n- The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or backdoor components.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — decoding untrusted input could pose a risk if used improperly, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard utility for digest encoding/decoding, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current report scores are reasonable and accurate.",
