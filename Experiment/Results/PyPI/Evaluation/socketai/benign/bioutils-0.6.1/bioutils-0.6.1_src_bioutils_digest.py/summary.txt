  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard digest utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is decoding untrusted input, which is inherent to such utilities but does not imply malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to the decoding of untrusted data. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low."
