{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for handling binary digests with encoding and decoding functionalities, supporting base64, base64url, and hex formats.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings for encoding schemes and digest representations; reads input data during static methods for decoding from base64, base64url, and hex.",
  "sinks": "Uses base64 and hex decoding functions which process input strings; no other significant sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input strings (base64, base64url, hex) are decoded into bytes; bytes are wrapped into Digest objects; string representations are generated from Digest objects. No untrusted data flows into system or external resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses standard cryptographic and encoding libraries without any obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'Digest' class that handles binary data with multiple encoding and decoding methods, relying solely on standard Python libraries (base64, binascii). It supports safe and common cryptographic data handling practices, with no external or untrusted data processing beyond decoding functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The main block performs simple integrity checks using standard hashing functions. Overall, the code appears to be a utility module for digest encoding with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for digest encoding and decoding, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It utilizes standard libraries and functions without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
