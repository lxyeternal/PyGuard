  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific utility for allele normalization with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.0-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."
