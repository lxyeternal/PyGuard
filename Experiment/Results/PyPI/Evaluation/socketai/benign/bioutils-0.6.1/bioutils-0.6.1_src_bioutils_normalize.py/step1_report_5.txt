{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for normalizing genetic allele sequences, including trimming, shuffling, and anchoring to achieve comparable representations.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequences (sequence string), interval bounds, and allele sequences; uses internal functions to process alleles; reads configuration parameters such as mode and anchor lengths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs modified interval positions and allele sequences; no direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Reads input data (sequence, alleles, bounds, mode) -> performs trimming/shuffling/anchoring -> returns normalized alleles and updated interval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors; no obfuscated code present. Debug functions are purely for tracing internal state. No external network or file operations are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements allele normalization procedures with various modes (EXPAND, LEFTSHUFFLE, RIGHTSHUFFLE, VCF). It includes detailed trimming and shifting operations based on sequence analysis, with safeguards such as validation of input values and modes. Debugging functions output internal states but do not execute external commands or network calls. The code relies on standard Python features and libraries, with no signs of malicious activity. No data leakage, external communication, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate sequence normalization for genetic data without any malicious intent. It contains no malware, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. Its security risk is negligible, and it appears to be a standard implementation of allele normalization algorithms.",
