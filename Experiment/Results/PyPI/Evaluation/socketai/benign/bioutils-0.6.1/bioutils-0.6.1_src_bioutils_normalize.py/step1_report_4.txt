{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing alleles in genetic sequences, including trimming, shuffling, and anchoring for comparison.",
  "sources": "Sequence input (sequence parameter), allele data (alleles parameter), interval (interval parameter), environment variables are not used here.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code does not send data over networks, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sequence and alleles into normalization functions; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a sequence normalization process for genetic data, including trimming common prefixes/suffixes and circularly shifting allele sequences for normalization. The code is well-structured with clear functions and debugging tools. It does not perform any network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious patterns are present. The only dynamic parts are sequence processing functions, which are standard for bioinformatics tasks. The debugging code is straightforward and used solely for visualization. Overall, the code appears benign, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of allele normalization functions used in bioinformatics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely manipulates sequence data internally without external side effects.",
