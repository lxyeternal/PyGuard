{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for normalizing allele sequences in genomic data, including trimming, shuffling, and anchoring, for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: sequence (reference sequence), interval (genomic position), alleles (list of sequences). Also reads sequence data for internal functions like roll_left and roll_right.",
  "sinks": "Modifies and returns allele sequences and interval positions; no direct data leakage or external output functions; no network, file, or system command calls.",
  "flows": "Sequence input is used to normalize alleles; normalization processes manipulate allele sequences and positional intervals; no external untrusted data flow beyond parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; functions perform sequence manipulations consistent with their purpose; no suspicious data handling, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics sequence normalization involving trimming common prefixes/suffixes, circular shifting (rolling), and anchoring with flanking sequences. It utilizes safe string operations, avoids executing external commands, and does not handle external input/output beyond parameters. The internal functions like trim_left, trim_right, roll_left, and roll_right perform sequence manipulations in a straightforward manner. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, file access, or system commands are present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. It appears to be a legitimate sequence normalization module for genomic data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of allele normalization routines for genomic data. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified. It operates solely on provided sequence data with no external data leaks or harmful actions.",
