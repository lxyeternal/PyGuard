{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing genetic alleles by trimming, shuffling, and anchoring sequences to ensure comparable representations within a specified sequence interval.",
  "sources": "The code reads input sequences (reference sequence), interval bounds, and allele strings; primarily from function parameters and internal sequence slicing.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs; all processing is internal, with optional debug print statements controlled by a flag.",
  "flows": "Sequence data flows from input parameters into trimming, shuffling, and anchoring functions, resulting in normalized alleles and updated interval bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; debug statements are controlled via a flag.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics sequence normalization operations, including trimming common prefixes/suffixes, circular shuffling, and anchoring with flanking sequences. Validation checks prevent misuse, and no external communication or malicious activity is present. Debug print statements are safe and optional. The functions are straightforward, domain-specific, and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific utility for allele normalization with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.0-0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
