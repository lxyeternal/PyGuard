  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, read-only utility for accessing local static data files containing genome assembly information.\n- They consistently identify no suspicious code, obfuscation, external data flows, or malicious activity.\n- The data sources are internal package resources, and functions perform simple data retrieval, mapping, and filtering.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution is observed.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 to 1.0), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to correctly implement its described functionality. The functions are well-structured, and their logic aligns with their purposes.\n- **Potential issues:** No actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - **Security risk:** Very low (0.2 to 0), justified by the static, local data access.\n- **Flow and data handling:** All data flows are internal and read-only, with no external inputs or outputs that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports conclude that the code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent, thorough, and justified. The high confidence levels support this.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate. The security risk scores are also reasonable, given the static data source and read-only operations.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No such claims are made; the reports are cautious and based on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores align well with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive reviews, the data sources, and the code's behavior, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, justified by static data access, but considering the possibility of static data being compromised in rare cases, a minimal score is acceptable.\n\n**Overall, I see no security concerns.** The code is a safe, standard utility for genome data management.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
