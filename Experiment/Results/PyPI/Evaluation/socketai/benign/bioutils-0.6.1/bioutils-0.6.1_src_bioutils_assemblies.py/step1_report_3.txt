{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to access, list, and process genome assembly data stored in compressed JSON files for biological research purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads assembly data files from the '_data/assemblies' directory using the importlib.resources module and gzip to open and parse JSON data.",
  "sinks": "The code loads data into Python dictionaries; no data is sent to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The functions retrieve data from local resource files; there are no flows from untrusted input to sensitive operations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears standard for data access and mapping functions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles reading and parsing static, local JSON files containing genome assembly data, constructing mappings between sequence names and accessions, and filtering primary sequences. The functions use standard library modules for file handling and JSON parsing without executing any untrusted input or performing network operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed, and the functions align with expected data processing workflows in bioinformatics. Internal functions such as '_is_primary' are straightforward and only perform simple equality checks. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious code behavior within the scope of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation for managing local genomic assembly data. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code’s purpose is purely data retrieval and mapping, with no external communication or suspicious logic.",
