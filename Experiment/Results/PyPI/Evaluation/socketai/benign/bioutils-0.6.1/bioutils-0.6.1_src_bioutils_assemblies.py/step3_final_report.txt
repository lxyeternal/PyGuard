{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to list, retrieve, and map genome assembly data stored in static, packaged JSON.gz files, facilitating access to assembly sequences and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads local gzipped JSON files from the '_data/assemblies' directory within the package using 'resources.files()'.",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded into memory as dictionaries; no external data transmission or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads static files into Python dictionaries; no external network or dynamic code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; straightforward data access functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static, read-only access to internal data files containing genome assembly information. It uses standard libraries ('json', 'gzip', 'importlib.resources') safely, with no external inputs or outputs. Functions for listing assemblies, retrieving specific assembly data, and creating mappings are implemented cleanly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data source is internal and trusted, minimizing risk. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static data retrieval utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. It only accesses internal, packaged data files and performs read-only operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
