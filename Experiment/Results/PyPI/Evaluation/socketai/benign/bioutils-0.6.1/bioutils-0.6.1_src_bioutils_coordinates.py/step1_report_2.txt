{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for converting between different coordinate systems used in genomic annotations and for converting strand orientation indicators between symbols and integers.",
  "sources": "Input comes from function arguments (`s`, `i`) in `strand_pm_to_int` and `strand_int_to_pm` functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted input is used improperly elsewhere, but within this code, there are no such sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments are validated and converted to standard representations; no external data flows or network communication are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The license block is standard and unrelated to malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining constants for strand orientation and providing simple conversion functions between '+'/'-' and 1/-1. These functions include basic input validation returning None for unrecognized inputs. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent. It serves utility purposes for coordinate and strand conversions with standard, safe implementations. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
