  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between different genomic coordinate systems and strand representations.",
  "sources": "Constants defining strand directions, input arguments to functions for strand conversion.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strand character or integer flows through conversion functions returning standardized representations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward functions to convert strand symbols ('+'/'-') to integers (1/-1) and vice versa. No external data sources, no network calls, no file I/O, no suspicious logic. The functions are well-documented and simple. The module primarily provides coordinate system documentation and basic utility functions. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves as a utility module for coordinate conversions, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
