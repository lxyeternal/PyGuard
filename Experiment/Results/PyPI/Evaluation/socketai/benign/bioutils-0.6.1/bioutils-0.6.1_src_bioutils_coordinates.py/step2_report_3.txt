  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the provided reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of simple, well-documented functions for converting strand symbols ('+', '-') to integers (1, -1) and vice versa.\n- There are no external data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The license block is standard and unrelated to security concerns.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The functions handle input validation appropriately, returning None for unrecognized inputs.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and intended as a utility module for bioinformatics coordinate conversions.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for coordinate conversions.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no external I/O, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Conversion utilities for strand orientation.\n- Findings: Input validation present; no external data handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Coordinate and strand conversions.\n- Findings: Straightforward functions, no external data or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for genomic coordinate systems.\n- Findings: No external dependencies, no obfuscation, no malicious signs.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Coordinate and strand conversion utilities.\n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious activity, securityRisk=0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.\n- No adjustments needed; the scoring aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and well-documented.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All functions are simple, safe, and serve a clear purpose in bioinformatics workflows.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
