{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between different nucleotide coordinate systems and strand representations used in genomics, specifically for the HGVS nomenclature.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function arguments 's' (string) and 'i' (integer).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; functions simply return conversion results based on input.",
  "flows": "Input variables are passed directly into functions; no complex data flow or external data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no obfuscated parts. It is straightforward and well-commented.",
  "analysis": "The module provides basic conversion functions for strand symbols and coordinate systems. It uses simple conditional logic without external dependencies or side effects. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a utility library intended for genomic coordinate conversions, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for coordinate conversions in genomics, with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
