  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between different nucleotide coordinate systems and strand representations.",
  "sources": "Function definitions, variable assignments, and string literals used for documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data output, no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions process input parameters and return values without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and consists of coordinate conversion utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides strand conversion functions (+/- to 1/-1 and vice versa) with clear, documented examples. It only handles string and integer conversions related to biological data representation, with no external I/O, network access, or dynamic code execution. The license information is standard and non-malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for coordinate conversions in bioinformatics. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. It is safe to use.",
