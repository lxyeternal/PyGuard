  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between different nucleotide coordinate systems and strand representations in bioinformatics contexts.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines functions for input transformation and includes documentation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the functions operate on given parameters and do not process external input or produce external output beyond returning conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward, well-documented functions for coordinate and strand conversions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two main functions: strand_pm_to_int and strand_int_to_pm, which convert strand symbols ('+', '-') to integers (1, -1) and vice versa. These functions include input validation and return None for unrecognized inputs, which is appropriate. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The license comments are standard and do not affect security. Overall, the code appears to be a utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for coordinate and strand conversions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate coordinate system interconversion in bioinformatics workflows.",
