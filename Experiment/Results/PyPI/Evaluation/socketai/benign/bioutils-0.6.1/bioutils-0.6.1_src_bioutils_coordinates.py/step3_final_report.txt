  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between different genomic coordinate systems and strand representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions `strand_pm_to_int` and `strand_int_to_pm`.",
  "sinks": "Return values of the functions; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input strand symbol ('+', '-') flows to integer (1, -1) via `strand_pm_to_int`; integer flows back to symbol via `strand_int_to_pm`.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, well-documented utility functions for coordinate conversions. It handles invalid inputs gracefully by returning None. There are no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The license and comments are standard. The functions are static and serve a specific purpose in bioinformatics workflows. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for coordinate and strand conversions with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
