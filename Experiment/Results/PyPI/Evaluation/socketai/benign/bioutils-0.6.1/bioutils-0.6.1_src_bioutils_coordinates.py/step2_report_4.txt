  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a simple utility module for coordinate system conversions and strand orientation representations.\n- It contains functions that convert '+'/'-' to 1/-1 and vice versa.\n- The code is well-documented, straightforward, and free of external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The license block is standard and unrelated to malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for coordinate conversions.\n- Analysis: No external data flow, no anomalies, straightforward functions.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Conversion between strand symbols and integers.\n- Analysis: Input validation present; no external data handling.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, coordinate and strand conversions.\n- Analysis: Simple functions, no external I/O, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Strand and coordinate conversions.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no external dependencies, straightforward.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for coordinate and strand conversions.\n- Analysis: Same as above, no issues.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as provided; no hidden or malicious code snippets are present.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 in all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear and well-documented.\n- **Security risk:** The code is purely utility functions with no external interactions, so a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Justification\n\nGiven the code's simplicity, clarity, and lack of suspicious behavior, **all scores are reasonable**. The malware score should remain at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0, with a security risk score of 0.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard utility module with no security concerns. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and appropriate for use in bioinformatics workflows. The scoring in all reports accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
