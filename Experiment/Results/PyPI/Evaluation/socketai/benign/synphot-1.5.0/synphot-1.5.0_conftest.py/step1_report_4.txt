{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure testing environment, importing necessary modules, and managing version information for dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`pytest_astropy_header`, `synphot`, `astropy.utils`), reads environment conditions (try-except blocks for imports), and sets configuration data in dictionaries (`PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`, `TESTED_VERSIONS`).",
  "sinks": "Data stored in dictionaries (`PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`, `TESTED_VERSIONS`) used for reporting; no direct sink for untrusted data; no external data or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imports (source) into configuration dictionaries (sink), with no user input or untrusted data processing. No flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns observed. Commented-out code is harmless placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs safe setup: importing modules with fallback error handling, setting configuration options for testing, and managing version info. The import of `synphot` and `astropy.utils` functions appears benign. Use of try-except blocks avoids crashing if modules are missing. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The commented lines are configuration placeholders and do not contain malicious code. Overall, the code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for testing environment configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages module imports, configuration data, and version settings.",
