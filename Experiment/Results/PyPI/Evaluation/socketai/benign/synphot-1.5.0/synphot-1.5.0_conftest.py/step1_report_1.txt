{
  "purpose": "This code configures environment variables, imports specific modules for testing and version management, and sets display options for numpy and testing headers for a scientific Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest_astropy_header.display', 'synphot', 'astropy.utils', and potential environment conditions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling found that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional module initializations, setting test configuration parameters and numpy options based on version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs typical environment setup tasks with standard library and package imports.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages import exceptions, sets package version information for testing, and adjusts numpy print options based on version comparisons. It manipulates dictionaries related to testing headers without executing any untrusted or suspicious operations. No network activity, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard setup/configuration code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for testing and configuration purposes in a scientific Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
