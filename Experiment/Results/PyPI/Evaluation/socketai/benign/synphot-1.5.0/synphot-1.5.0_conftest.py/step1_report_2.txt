  "purpose": "Configure testing environment and display modules and their versions for the astropy-based project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (pytest_astropy_header, synphot, astropy.utils), variable assignments, and modifications to PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES and TESTED_VERSIONS dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> check for ImportError -> assign default values if import fails -> set numpy print options based on version check -> modify header modules and tested versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious code behavior. The code modifies module display settings and version tracking, which are typical for testing setups. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific modules and assigns default values if imports fail, which is standard practice for optional dependencies. It conditionally modifies numpy print options based on version checks, which is benign. The code then customizes module display lists for testing output. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful side effects. The code only interacts with testing and version management routines, with no network activity or system modifications beyond standard library calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration script for testing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
