  "purpose": "Configure testing environment and display settings for various astronomy-related Python packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pytest_astropy_header', 'synphot', 'astropy.utils', and package version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> check and assign package versions -> set numpy print options -> modify display settings for package versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Commented-out code is benign. The version check and numpy options are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules for testing and version management, conditionally sets numpy options, and manipulates a configuration dictionary for package display settings. It handles ImportError gracefully, with no dynamic or unsafe behavior. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or processed in a suspicious manner. The code appears to be configuration/setup code typical in scientific Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for testing environments with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply manages package imports, version info, and display settings.",
