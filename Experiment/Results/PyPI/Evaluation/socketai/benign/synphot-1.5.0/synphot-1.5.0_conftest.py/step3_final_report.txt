  "purpose": "Configure import dependencies, version checks, and display options for testing in a scientific Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest_astropy_header.display, synphot, astropy.utils, and in-memory dictionary modifications.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; only in-memory configuration.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version checks influence configuration dictionaries and numpy print options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import fallback patterns, version checks, and dictionary manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe, standard setup routines: handling optional imports with try-except, checking numpy version to set print options, and modifying dictionaries for test headers and version info. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical testing environment setup in scientific Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a standard configuration script, and all assessments and scores are appropriate.",
