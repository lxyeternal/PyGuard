{
  "purpose": "This code configures test environment settings and package version reporting for a Python project, mainly related to astropy and associated packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements for optional dependencies (pytest_astropy_header, synphot, astropy), and local configuration code that modifies package version display settings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing, no output or network operations, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads package versions and modifies in-memory configuration objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules, sets configuration parameters based on availability, and updates a package version dictionary. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs safe, common setup tasks without external data handling or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for testing configurations, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only manages package version info and display options, without performing any unsafe operations.",
