  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with C extension configuration and command-line help handling.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv), module imports, configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard setup process.",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence control flow for help messages; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that defines extension modules, handles command-line arguments to display help, and invokes setup(). It performs no network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is typical for package configuration scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup utility with no malicious or security concerns. The code structure and behavior are typical, and no anomalies are present.",
