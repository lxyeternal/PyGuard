  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Standard setup script reading command-line args, importing common modules, configuring C extension.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No dangerous data sinks; flow is typical for a setup script.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The code is a straightforward package setup script, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.95). No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.05 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- Again, a standard setup script with no suspicious patterns.\n- Slightly higher confidence (1.0), and minimal security risk (0.1), which is acceptable given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- Same conclusion: typical setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- Consistent with others; standard setup code, no anomalies.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: No obfuscation detected, scores are zero.\n- **Security Risk**: Very low, given the nature of the code; some reports assign a minimal risk (~0.05-0.1) due to the potential for misinterpretation, but nothing suspicious is present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the code's straightforward nature, absence of obfuscation, and no malicious activity, **my estimated scores are**:\n- **Malware**: **0**\n- **Obfuscated**: **0**\n- **Risk**: **0.05** (a minimal, almost negligible risk due to the possibility of future modifications or misinterpretations)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the actual code content.",
