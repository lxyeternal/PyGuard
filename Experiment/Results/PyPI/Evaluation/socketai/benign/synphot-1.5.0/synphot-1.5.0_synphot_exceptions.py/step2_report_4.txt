  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. They note the absence of input/output handling, data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The code defines custom exception classes, including a specialized constructor in `TableFormatError` that formats error messages and stores optional row information. This is standard practice in Python for error handling and does not introduce any security risks.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**  \n   - The only notable logic is in `TableFormatError.__init__`, which appends additional context to the exception message. This is safe and typical.\n   - No external data is processed, no code is executed dynamically, and no external inputs are handled insecurely.\n   - No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, the code is straightforward and readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Inconsistencies:**  \n   The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature. They correctly identify the code as non-malicious and safe.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a scientific library. It does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign, straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for error handling in a synthetic photometry context. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
