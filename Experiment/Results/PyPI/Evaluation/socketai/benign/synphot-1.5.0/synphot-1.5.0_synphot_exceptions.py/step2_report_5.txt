  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the underlying code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Summary:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to synthetic photometry.\n   - The classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - `TableFormatError` has a custom constructor that accepts a message and optional row indices, storing additional context and formatting the error message.\n   - All classes are purely structural, with no dynamic code, I/O, network operations, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code is static class definitions for error handling.\n   - No input/output handling, data processing, or external communication.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The only slightly complex part is in `TableFormatError.__init__`, which formats error messages and stores context, but this is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and readable; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external dependencies, the security risk is minimal. The report assigns a score of 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, as the code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions.\n   - The detailed formatting in `TableFormatError` does not introduce security issues; it is a common pattern for error reporting.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The reports are consistent with the code.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
