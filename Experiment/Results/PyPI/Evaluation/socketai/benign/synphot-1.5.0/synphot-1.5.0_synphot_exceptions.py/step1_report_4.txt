{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in synthetic photometry, particularly related to table formatting, wavelength issues, overlaps, and source compatibility.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no processing of untrusted data occurs within these classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; these are exception class definitions without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code follows standard Python class inheritance and exception handling conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes to handle specific error scenarios in a synthetic photometry context. The only notable logic is in the constructor of TableFormatError, where additional error information is stored and formatted for display. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code appears purely for error handling and does not perform network communication, file operations, or data processing beyond exception message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a structured error management system for a scientific application, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
