{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to synthetic photometry processing.",
  "sources": "Input data is not directly read; the code primarily defines exception classes. The only data input-related aspect is in the constructor of TableFormatError which accepts error messages and optional row indices.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or interact with external systems; it only constructs exception objects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception messages are constructed internally without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is standard exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of exception classes for use in a larger package. The TableFormatError class captures specific error context (rows) and formats messages accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to standard Python exception handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exceptions related to synthetic photometry. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard, safe component for error handling within a larger codebase.",
