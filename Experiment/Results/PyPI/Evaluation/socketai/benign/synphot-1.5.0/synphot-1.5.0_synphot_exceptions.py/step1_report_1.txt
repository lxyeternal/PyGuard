  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in synthetic photometry processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data; it defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data or output to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to output are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, including an extended constructor in TableFormatError. It does not execute any input/output, network operations, or system modifications. The classes are standard Python exception subclasses with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is purely structural and intended for error handling within a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions for a Python library related to synthetic photometry. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and standard in nature.",
