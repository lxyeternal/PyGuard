  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to synthetic photometry.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or input/output operations are present.\n   - The only notable logic is in the `TableFormatError` constructor, which formats error messages and stores optional row information.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n   - They accurately note the absence of malicious behavior, data flow, or security risks.\n   - The detailed reasoning about the constructor of `TableFormatError` is accurate, emphasizing its role in error context.\n   - No significant flaws or logical errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which seems justified.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align well with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes with no dynamic or external interactions, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 or very low are appropriate.\n   - No higher scores are warranted here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - They do not infer vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what the code demonstrates.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no security concerns.\n   - This consistency is appropriate given the code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note**:\nThis code is a standard, safe component of a scientific library, with no signs of security issues or malicious intent.",
