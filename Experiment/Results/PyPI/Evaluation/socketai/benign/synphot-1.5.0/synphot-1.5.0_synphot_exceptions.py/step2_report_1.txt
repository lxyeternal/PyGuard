  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes for a synthetic photometry library.\n- The only non-trivial logic is in `TableFormatError`, which formats an error message and stores optional row information.\n- The code is purely structural, with no input/output, network, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with minimal logic. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and straightforward.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. The security risk is 0, also appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and standard; obfuscation score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores and conclusions across reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
