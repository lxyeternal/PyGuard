{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for synthetic photometry error handling, with minimal logic primarily for error message formatting.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; exception classes are static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with standard constructor logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with only the TableFormatError class containing additional logic to format error messages and store optional row information. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The implementation is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a scientific library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0.",
