{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in synthetic photometry operations.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code defines exception classes and their initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely class definitions and error handling structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error signaling within the larger application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code adheres to standard Python exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class, with no dynamic execution, network operations, or data manipulation. The implementation of TableFormatError includes an attribute assignment and message formatting, which are standard practices. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection points, and no suspicious data flows. The code is straightforward and focused on error handling for a specific domain, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides custom exception classes for synthetic photometry errors without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation of error classes with no security risks.",
