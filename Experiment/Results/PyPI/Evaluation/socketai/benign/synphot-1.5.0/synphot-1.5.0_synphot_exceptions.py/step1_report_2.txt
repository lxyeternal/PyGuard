  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions related to synthetic photometry operations and error handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and their initializations.",
  "sinks": "No data flow, input, or output handling present; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data pathways; solely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes for handling specific error cases in synthetic photometry computations. It includes class inheritance, custom messages, and optional attributes. There are no data inputs, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. All classes are standard Python exception subclasses, with minimal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is safe and typical for a scientific codebase to include such error definitions. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
