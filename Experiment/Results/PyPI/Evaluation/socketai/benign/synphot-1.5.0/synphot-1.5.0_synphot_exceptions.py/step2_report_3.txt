  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes for use in a synthetic photometry library.\n   - The only non-trivial logic is in `TableFormatError`, which manages an optional `rows` attribute and formats an error message accordingly.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data streams.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, it doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n   - The only minor concern could be the handling of the `rows` attribute in `TableFormatError`, but it is straightforward and does not pose a security risk.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n   \n   The reports consistently assign high confidence (1.0) and zero to malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the actual content.\n\n5. **Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions, with no security concerns.",
