  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard spectral data I/O functions, no suspicious sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Use of deprecated arguments is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis:** Functions perform expected data handling with proper validation. No network, code injection, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, likely due to deprecated argument warning).\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. The malware score is correctly zero given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar standard spectral data handling, including remote file access.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard use of trusted libraries.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate spectral data module, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 (no security concern).\n\n**Assessment:** The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with FITS and ASCII handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, only standard data processing and a warning about file overwrite.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to potential overwrite, but not malicious).\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar spectral data I/O functions, including remote access.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard warnings and deprecation notices.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard library usage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly higher but still low).\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same purpose, standard data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no suspicious behavior, only deprecated argument warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for data I/O, with no network, injection, or sabotage logic.  \n  **Estimated malware score:** **0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation, minified code, or hidden logic detected. The code is straightforward and readable.  \n  **Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the use of deprecated arguments and potential file overwrite capabilities, which are standard in data handling but could pose minor risks if misused. However, these are not malicious or security-critical issues.  \n  **Estimated risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-maintained module for reading and writing spectral data.\n- No malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage patterns are present.\n- The deprecated arguments do not introduce security vulnerabilities, only potential future compatibility issues.\n- The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**             | No malicious activity detected; purely data I/O functions.                                |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**             | Code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns.                              |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1 - 0.2**     | Minor concerns due to deprecated arguments and overwrite capability, but no real threat. |\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall security posture of this code is very high; it is safe and free from malicious or obfuscated content.",
