{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for reading and writing spectral data in ASCII and FITS formats, including remote access capabilities.",
  "sources": "File input/output functions, get_readable_fileobj for remote data retrieval, data columns in ASCII and FITS tables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to file overwrite if not handled carefully; no untrusted data sinks or malicious code detected.",
  "flows": "Read functions take filename or file object, validate units, parse data, and output quantities; write functions convert quantities to arrays, validate, and save to FITS.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated arguments in read_fits_spec; no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs trusted libraries (astropy, numpy), performs standard data validation, and handles spectral data without network activity or malicious logic. Deprecated arguments are noted but benign. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected. Risk primarily from file overwrite capability and deprecated args, but these are operational concerns, not security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for spectral data I/O with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and overall, the code can be considered secure for supply chain purposes.",
