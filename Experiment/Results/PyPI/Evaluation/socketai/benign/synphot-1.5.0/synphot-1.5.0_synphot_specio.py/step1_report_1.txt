{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to read and write astronomical spectral data in FITS and ASCII formats, facilitating data handling for spectral analysis.",
  "sources": "File input via filename or file pointer, data read through astropy.io and astropy.utils.data.get_readable_fileobj",
  "sinks": "Data output to FITS files, with headers and spectral data stored in tables",
  "flows": "File reading functions process input data from disk or remote sources, convert to astropy Quantity objects; write functions convert data to FITS format and write to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of deprecated argument 'wave_unit' and 'flux_unit' is noted but not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious code structures found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and astropy modules, handles file I/O for spectral data, converts units, manages data precision, and writes FITS files. All functions perform expected data processing with proper validation. No indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic are present. The code does not execute external commands, nor does it handle untrusted input in a way that would lead to code injection. Usage of warnings and exception handling appears standard. There is no evidence of hidden or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the use of deprecated arguments which could lead to misuse but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for spectral data I/O in astronomy, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It operates solely within the expected domain of data handling, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
