{
  "purpose": "The code handles reading and writing spectral data in FITS and ASCII formats for astronomical data processing, providing functions for remote access and file I/O.",
  "sources": "get_readable_fileobj (reads remote files), ascii.read (reads ASCII tables), fits.open (reads FITS files), user input filenames and file pointers",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, system commands, or sensitive data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Input filenames or file objects -> file reading functions -> data parsing and processing -> output data structures or file writing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of warnings and deprecated arguments appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file input/output operations for spectral data, with functions to read remote or local files, parse ASCII and FITS formats, and write FITS spectra. It uses well-known libraries like astropy and numpy, with proper unit validation and data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden network activities. The deprecated argument handling aligns with typical library evolution. The code relies on trusted libraries and standard file operations, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spectral data handling module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to standard practices for reading/writing astronomical data files. No malicious behavior or security threats are evident.",
