{
  "purpose": "This module handles reading and writing of synthetic photometry data formats, specifically FITS and ASCII spectra, for astronomical applications.",
  "sources": "File input/output functions, data reading functions, get_readable_fileobj (downloads or opens remote files), ascii.read (reads ASCII tables), fits.open (opens FITS files).",
  "sinks": "Writing FITS files via fits.HDUList.writeto, potentially overwriting existing files, and data conversions in read/write functions.",
  "flows": "Input filenames or file pointers are read via get_readable_fileobj or directly. Data is processed and converted into quantities with units. Wavelengths and fluxes are processed, possibly with unit conversions or zero-flux filtering. When writing, data is converted to specific precisions, and FITS files are created with headers and tables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard data I/O, unit validation, and array manipulation. The deprecation warning is related to standards compliance, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard file I/O, data validation, unit handling, and data processing for spectrum data. It uses well-known libraries (astropy, numpy) for these operations. No network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is detected. The use of warnings and exception handling is typical for robust code. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are identified. The only potential concern is file overwrite capability, which is standard for data writing functions but should be used cautiously; however, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for reading and writing spectral data with no signs of malicious behavior. It safely handles data conversions and file operations without suspicious patterns or embedded malicious actions.",
