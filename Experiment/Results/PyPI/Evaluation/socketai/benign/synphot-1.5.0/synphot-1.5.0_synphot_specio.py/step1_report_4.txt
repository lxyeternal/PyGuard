{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for reading and writing spectral data in FITS and ASCII formats, primarily for astronomical applications, including remote data access.",
  "sources": "Input filenames or file-like objects, and environment variables indirectly through dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes files to disk; no direct network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input filenames → file reading functions (get_readable_fileobj, fits.open, ascii.read) → data processing and output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of deprecated arguments is noted but not malicious. No obfuscated code present. Warnings and error handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard open-source libraries for file handling, data parsing, and FITS file operations with proper error handling and deprecation warnings. It reads spectral data from files or remote sources, processes units safely, and writes FITS files with metadata. No indicators of malicious activities such as network communications, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code adheres to typical patterns used in astronomical data processing, and there are no suspicious operations or anomalies beyond standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured astronomical data handling functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs data input/output and processing tasks without any malicious side effects.",
