{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a package related to astrophysics data analysis, setting up imports, version handling, and test runner configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path via os.path.dirname(__file__) and attempts to import version information from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, database operations, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and setting up a test runner; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard package initialization and cleanup routines. The import and deletion of variables are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script, importing necessary modules and creating a test runner. It includes a try-except block for version import, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of 'del' to clean up namespace is benign. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are identified. The imports are from local modules, which is typical for package initialization. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward, benign setup script for a scientific package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs imports, version handling, and cleanup routines, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
