  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard package setup, no malicious behavior, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code indeed performs standard imports, handles import errors gracefully, creates a test runner, and cleans up namespace. No suspicious activity, no external network calls, no data leaks. The conclusion is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package initialization, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with safe practices like try-except for version import and namespace cleanup. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. No network activity, no untrusted data, no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the code is standard, the report notes that the use of dynamic imports and namespace cleanup could be misused for obfuscation or hiding malicious imports. However, in this context, these are common practices in package setup. The small securityRisk score reflects a cautious stance but isn't strongly justified by the code.\n\n**Justification for scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation evident)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to namespace cleanup, but not malicious)  \n- Confidence: 0.9 (high confidence in benign nature)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard package setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code. No external calls, no data leaks, no suspicious constructs.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; set to 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in Report 4 due to cautious interpretation, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical package initialization script, with safe practices like error handling and namespace cleanup.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The minor securityRisk in Report 4 is justified as very low, considering the namespace cleanup could, in theory, be misused, but in this context, it is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to namespace cleanup, but negligible)  \n\nThe overall risk is minimal, and the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
