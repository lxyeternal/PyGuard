{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an Astropy affiliated package, imports necessary modules, and initializes a test runner for self-testing the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, astropy.tests.runner, and local modules like .version, .config, .utils, .models, .observation, .reddening, .thermal, and .spectrum.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points where untrusted input affects sensitive operations or leaks data.",
  "flows": "The flow is mainly initialization: importing modules, creating a test runner, and cleaning up namespace. There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be standard package setup and testing configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and internal package components, handles import errors gracefully, and creates a test runner object. It also deletes temporary references. There are no indications of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and typical for an open-source scientific package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies. It is safe based on the provided content.",
