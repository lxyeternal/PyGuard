{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an Astropy-affiliated package, handling version info, setting up a test runner, importing package modules, and cleaning up the namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, astropy.tests.runner, and local modules; version import with try-except.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Importing version and modules, creating test runner, then deleting temporary references.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import handling and namespace cleanup with 'del' statements; standard practice but could be misused for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of try-except for optional version import and namespace cleanup are common in package initialization. No external network activity or untrusted input processing is present. The code structure is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious content. The minor security risk score assigned in one report (0.1) can be lowered to 0 for consistency, as there is no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
