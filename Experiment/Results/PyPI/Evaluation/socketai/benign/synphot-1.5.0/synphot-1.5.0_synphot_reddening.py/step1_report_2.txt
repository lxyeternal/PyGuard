  "anomalies": [
    "Use of numpy functions and spectral data reading functions appears standard, no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
    "The code contains standard scientific calculations with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
    "Commented TODO regarding magic numbers, but no actual obfuscated or malicious code present.",
    "No suspicious network activity or system modifications detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for handling astrophysical reddening and extinction models, including methods for reading/writing spectral data and applying extinction formulas. It performs typical scientific computations using numpy and astropy, with standard file I/O. The functions include typical error handling for invalid input, and no suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors is evident. No hardcoded secrets, network communications, or system modifications are present. The logic appears consistent with its scientific purpose. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard scientific module for astrophysical modeling with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected calculations, file I/O, and data validation without suspicious side effects.",
