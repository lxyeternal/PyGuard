{
  "purpose": "This module defines astrophysical extinction and reddening laws, provides methods for generating extinction curves, reading/writing spectral data, and applying models such as Madau (1995) for galaxy extinction. It facilitates scientific modeling of interstellar dust effects.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (e.g., wavelengths, E(B-V), redshift), external spectral data files (FITS or ASCII), configuration files for extinction models, and model attributes.",
  "sinks": "Writes spectral data and extinction curves to FITS files, outputs data structures representing extinction models and curves.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and external data are validated and processed through class methods to generate extinction curves, which can be saved or used in further modeling; data flows from file reading to model computation to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. External data files are standard in scientific software; no network activity or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard astrophysical calculations using well-known libraries (numpy, astropy, synphot). It includes data validation, file I/O, and model generation consistent with scientific modeling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation identified. External configuration and data files are used as intended. Input validation and data handling are appropriate, with no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific module for modeling interstellar extinction and reddening. It contains no malicious or sabotage behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling, which is standard in such applications.",
