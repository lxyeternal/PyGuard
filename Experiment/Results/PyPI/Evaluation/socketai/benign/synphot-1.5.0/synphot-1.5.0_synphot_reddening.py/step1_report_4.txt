{
  "purpose": "Define and handle various extinction and reddening laws, including generating extinction curves, reading/writing data, and applying astrophysical models.",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters (e.g., ebv, wavelengths, filename), reading files via specio.read_spec/read_remote_spec, and user-provided inputs.",
  "sinks": "Generated extinction curves, FITS files, and data arrays. No data is sent over network or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., ebv, wavelengths) are processed to produce extinction curves; data is read from files and converted into spectra; functions generate extinction models and curves.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors; no obfuscated code or suspicious variable names; no signs of data leakage or hidden malicious logic; functions are standard astrophysical models.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of astrophysical extinction and reddening models using external libraries like astropy and synphot. It reads input data, performs mathematical modeling, and outputs extinction curves or files. There are no indications of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The presence of file reading and writing is typical for scientific software. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code structure and comments suggest clear, purpose-driven scientific computation without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate astrophysical modeling module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs data processing and file I/O related to extinction laws without any signs of malware or security risks.",
