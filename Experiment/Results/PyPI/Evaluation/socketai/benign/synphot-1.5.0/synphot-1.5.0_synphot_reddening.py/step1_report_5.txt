{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for handling reddening laws, extinction curves, and related astrophysical spectral models, including reading/writing data and applying extinction models.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and external files (via specio.read_spec, specio.read_remote_spec).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to FITS files via specio.write_fits_spec. No explicit untrusted data sinks like network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, external files) flows into class methods (extinction_curve, from_file, from_extinction_model) and functions (etau_madau), with calculations producing extinction curves returned as objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code. The code relies on external libraries and configuration files but does not contain hidden backdoors or malicious logic. The only notable hardcoded constants are scientific parameters related to astrophysics, which are appropriate for the context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of astrophysical spectral modeling classes with methods for generating and saving extinction curves, reading from files, and computing extinction models based on redshift. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated features, or suspicious network/system calls are present. External dependencies are used as intended for scientific purposes. No signs of malware, credential theft, or privacy violations are detected. The functions and classes perform scientifically valid operations and handle input validation appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured astrophysical spectral modeling library with no malicious intent or security risks. It strictly performs data processing and I/O relevant to its domain, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
