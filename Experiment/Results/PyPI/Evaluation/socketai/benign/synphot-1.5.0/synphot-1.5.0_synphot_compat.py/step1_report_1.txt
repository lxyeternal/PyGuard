{
  "purpose": "The module manages backward-compatibility by dynamically checking for optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own attribute names (__all__) to determine which dependencies to check for.",
  "sinks": "The code imports modules dynamically using importlib.import_module, which could potentially load malicious modules if the module names are manipulated.",
  "flows": "When an attribute like HAS_SPECUTILS or HAS_DUST_EXTINCTION is accessed, the code attempts to import the corresponding module and returns True if successful, False otherwise.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import based on attribute access is a potential concern if attribute names can be manipulated externally, but as a self-contained module, it appears controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines optional dependencies and dynamically checks their availability by importing them when specific attributes are accessed. The use of __getattr__ allows for lazy evaluation. The importlib.import_module call can import modules at runtime, which is a normal pattern for optional dependencies. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation is evident. The code's purpose is benign and standard for handling optional dependencies with lazy import checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a legitimate purpose for backward compatibility and optional dependency management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The dynamic import mechanism is controlled and predictable in this context.",
