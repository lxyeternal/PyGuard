{
  "purpose": "This module manages backward compatibility by checking the availability of optional dependencies at runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of optional dependencies ('specutils', 'dust_extinction') during import and when __getattr__ is called.",
  "sinks": "The importlib.import_module function dynamically loads modules based on the dependency names, which could be a potential sink if the module name is influenced maliciously.",
  "flows": "When an attribute like HAS_SPECUTILS is accessed, __getattr__ attempts to import the corresponding module; if successful, it returns True, otherwise False.",
  "anomalies": "The use of dynamic attribute creation (__getattr__) to load modules based on attribute access could be exploited if attribute names are manipulated to include malicious input, though this is limited by the controlled __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of optional dependencies and creates corresponding attribute names. When these attributes are accessed, __getattr__ dynamically imports the modules to verify their presence. This dynamic import is standard for optional dependencies management and does not inherently execute untrusted code. The design appears safe and straightforward. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The only potential concern is the dynamic import based on attribute names, but given the controlled __all__ list, this risk is minimal. The code does not perform any network communication or data leakage activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, controlled mechanism for backward compatibility handling. It uses dynamic attribute access to check for optional dependencies without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
