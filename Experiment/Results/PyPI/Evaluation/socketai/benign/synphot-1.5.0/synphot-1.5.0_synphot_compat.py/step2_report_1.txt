  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- It defines optional dependencies in `_optional_deps`.\n- It creates attribute names like `HAS_SPECUTILS`.\n- When such an attribute is accessed, `__getattr__` attempts to import the corresponding module via `importlib.import_module`.\n- If import succeeds, returns `True`; if not, `False`.\n- The module names are controlled and hardcoded in `_deps`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The dynamic import is a common pattern for optional dependencies management.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code manages backward compatibility via self-referential attribute names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies `importlib.import_module` as the dynamic import.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes potential concern if attribute names are manipulated, but as the module controls `__all__`, this is minimal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, security risk is zero, confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues found.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes `importlib.import_module` and dynamic import.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the potential exploitation if attribute names are manipulated, but the controlled `__all__` minimizes this.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, security risk is very low (0.1), confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- Similar to previous reports, correctly states the pattern.\n- Emphasizes the controlled nature of the module names.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence high, security risk minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Correctly identifies the pattern.\n- Notes that module names are static in `_deps`.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk is marked as 0, which aligns with the controlled import.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Also accurate, emphasizes the static nature of `_optional_deps`.\n- Correctly states that the import is controlled and standard.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — fitting.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code only performs safe, controlled dynamic imports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1) in some reports for security risk, which is acceptable given the dynamic import pattern, but overall, the risk is minimal.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the pattern is standard, controlled, and safe.\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code performs a controlled check for optional dependencies using static module names and dynamic import, which is a common pattern. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for the theoretical concern about dynamic import, but given the controlled environment, this is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and the code is safe from a security perspective. The overall risk is negligible, malware is absent, and obfuscation is not present.",
