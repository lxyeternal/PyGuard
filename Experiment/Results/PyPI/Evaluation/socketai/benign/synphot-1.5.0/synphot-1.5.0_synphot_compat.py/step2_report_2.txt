  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the described concerns, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The dynamic import is controlled via the _deps dictionary and __all__, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, and the import process is controlled. No issues are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, but notes a minimal securityRisk=0.1 due to the dynamic import mechanism, which could be a concern if attribute names are manipulated.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Given the controlled environment, the risk is minimal. The code relies on __all__ to limit attribute access, reducing the attack surface.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score is slightly elevated but justified, considering the potential for manipulation if attribute names are externally influenced. Still, the overall risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the importlib.import_module is used with static module names, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The code is safe, and the pattern is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that the module imports modules based on static names in _deps, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) possibly due to the inherent risk in dynamic imports, but given the static list, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirms that the pattern is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, and the import process is controlled.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0 or 0.1), justified by the controlled nature of the dynamic import.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency checking, with no evident security flaws.\n- The minor securityRisk=0.1 in one report is justified due to the nature of dynamic import, but given the static module list and controlled attribute access, the actual risk remains negligible.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, due to the dynamic import pattern, but controlled)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate. No further action needed.",
