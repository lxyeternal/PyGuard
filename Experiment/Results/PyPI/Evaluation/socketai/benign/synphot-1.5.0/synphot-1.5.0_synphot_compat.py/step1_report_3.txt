{
  "purpose": "The module handles backward compatibility by dynamically checking for the presence of optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module() invoked within __getattr__ to load optional dependencies based on attribute access.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "Accessing a module attribute triggers __getattr__, which attempts to import a module dynamically and returns a boolean indicating its availability.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic attribute access and importlib to load modules on demand, which is standard but can be exploited if attribute names are manipulated. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of optional dependencies and creates a mapping of their uppercase names. It dynamically constructs attribute names like HAS_SPECUTILS and checks for their existence by importing the modules. If the module cannot be imported, it returns False; otherwise, True. The __getattr__ method is used for lazy evaluation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The dynamic import logic is safe within this context and serves a compatibility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for handling optional dependencies with lazy loading. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The design is typical for compatibility modules and poses no evident security threat.",
