  "purpose": "This module handles backward compatibility by dynamically checking for the presence of optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of optional dependencies (_optional_deps) and attempts to import modules based on attribute access (__getattr__).",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the importlib.import_module call, which loads modules dynamically based on attribute names.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (e.g., HAS_SPECUTILS) triggers __getattr__, which attempts to import corresponding modules. If successful, returns True; otherwise, False.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The dynamic import based on attribute names is standard for optional dependency handling; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of optional dependencies and provides a dynamic attribute getter (__getattr__) to check if these dependencies are available. When an attribute like HAS_SPECUTILS is accessed, it extracts the module name, attempts to import it, and returns True or False accordingly. This pattern is common for managing optional dependencies in Python packages. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for backward compatibility handling via optional dependencies, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply dynamically checks for module availability.",
