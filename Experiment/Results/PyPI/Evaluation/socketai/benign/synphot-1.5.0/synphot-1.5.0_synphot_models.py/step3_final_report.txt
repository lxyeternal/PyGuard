  "purpose": "The code provides astrophysical spectral models (e.g., blackbody, Gaussian, Lorentzian, power-law, empirical) built with astropy, synphot, and numpy, intended for scientific spectral analysis and modeling.",
  "sources": "Input wavelengths, model parameters, and constants; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Computed spectral fluxes returned as model outputs; no data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input wavelengths and parameters through model evaluation functions to spectral flux outputs; no external data or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of standard scientific libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple spectral models for astrophysics, utilizing standard libraries and constants. It performs calculations based solely on input parameters and constants, with no network or file system operations. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The models accept untrusted inputs but this is typical for scientific modeling; proper validation is the responsibility of the caller. The malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting code clarity. Security risk scores are minimal, justified by the code's domain and lack of external system interaction. Overall, the code is legitimate, transparent, and safe for scientific use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate collection of astrophysical spectral models with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No further security concerns are warranted.",
