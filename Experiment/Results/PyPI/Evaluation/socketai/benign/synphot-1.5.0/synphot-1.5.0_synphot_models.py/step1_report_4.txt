{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of spectral models, mostly related to blackbody spectra, Gaussian functions, and other astrophysical models, for use in astrophysical data analysis within the synphot and astropy frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as temperature, wavelength arrays, model parameters, and possibly external data for empirical models. It also accesses class attributes and method parameters, and imports data from external libraries like astropy, synphot, and numpy.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include the evaluate methods which perform calculations on input data, but there are no external data transmissions or writes to disk, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and data arrays into evaluation functions, with transformations and calculations performed within these functions. No external or untrusted data sources are directly accessed or transmitted outside the program scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets. It utilizes standard astrophysical models, and all data processing appears legitimate. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No suspicious network activity, system access, or privacy-invasive operations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several astrophysical models such as BlackBody1D, Gaussian functions, and other spectral models. All functions perform calculations related to physics, using parameters, and return modeled spectra. The code adheres to typical conventions, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system sabotage. It imports widely used scientific libraries and employs them in straightforward ways. No indications of obfuscated or hidden code are present. The functions and class methods perform mathematical operations and data handling consistent with scientific modeling, without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate scientific modeling library intended for astrophysical data analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries appropriately, and performs expected computations without any suspicious activity.",
