  "purpose": "Standard configuration for Sphinx documentation build setup.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries, external modules, reads setup.cfg, retrieves version info.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or code execution from untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration files and package info; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with typical error handling and dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script for documentation, importing standard modules, handling missing dependencies gracefully, reading configuration files, and setting documentation parameters. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The high security risk scores in some reports (up to 0.9 or 1) are unjustified given the benign nature of the code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The risk scores should be lowered to reflect the safe, standard configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. The high risk scores assigned are overestimations and should be adjusted to zero or near-zero.",
