  "purpose": "Configuration script for building and documenting the Astropy project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (datetime, os, sys), package metadata via pkg_resources, configuration files (setup.cfg), and external modules (sphinx_astropy.conf).",
  "sinks": "Print statements for error handling, sys.exit() for termination, package version retrieval, and configuration variables used for documentation generation.",
  "flows": "Import and configuration setup lead to retrieval of package info and configuration data; error handling can terminate execution if dependencies are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; no network activity or malicious payloads; primarily standard configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data, handles missing dependencies gracefully, retrieves package version info, and sets documentation options. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute code beyond standard configuration. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident. The code is well-structured and serves its purpose as a configuration file without anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for project documentation with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks with proper error handling and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
