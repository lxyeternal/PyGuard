{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing thermal spectral elements with associated temperature and beam filling factor, including methods to generate a thermal source spectrum and to load such an element from a FITS file.",
  "sources": "Reads header information from FITS files (`fits.getheader`), and reads spectral data from files via `specio.read_spec`.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that handle untrusted data; no network communication, no file writing, no system commands.",
  "flows": "Header data from FITS files → stored in class attributes; spectral data from files → used to instantiate class; no external data flow leading to untrusted system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Uses `is_fits` with an empty string as the first argument, which is a non-standard usage, but does not perform any dangerous actions. The code validates quantities and manages spectral data in a typical manner. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for thermal spectral modeling, with methods to construct spectra from physical parameters or from FITS files. It uses well-known libraries (`astropy`, `synphot`) for scientific data handling, and performs validation of input quantities. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration code observed. The `is_fits` check is peculiar but does not pose a malicious threat. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific module for spectral modeling. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It securely reads data, validates inputs, and performs expected calculations. No signs of malware or security risks.",
