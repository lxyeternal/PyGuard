{
  "purpose": "Defines a thermal spectral element class for handling spectra with thermal properties, including loading from FITS files and applying blackbody emissivity.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'temperature', 'beam_fill_factor', and filename in 'from_file' method; external FITS files for data loading.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; data flows from input parameters and FITS file headers into object properties and spectra.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class properties -> 'thermal_source' method creates spectrum; 'from_file' reads FITS file header and data into class instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity; usage of external libraries appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for thermal spectrum modeling with methods for property validation, spectrum creation, and file input. It uses standard astrophysical data processing libraries and handles data securely by validating inputs and only reading from specified FITS files. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident. The code lacks network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only external interactions involve reading FITS headers and data, which is typical in scientific software.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a scientific spectral modeling library with no signs of malicious behavior. It securely reads input data, applies well-defined transformations, and does not exhibit any malware-like activity.",
