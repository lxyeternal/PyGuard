  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific module with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minimal security risk stems from external data loading, which is standard in scientific workflows. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and context."
