  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a class for thermal spectral elements, reading header info via `fits.getheader` and spectral data via `specio.read_spec`.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows; uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; code is a typical scientific utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, securityRisk=0. Overall consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose; reads FITS headers and spectral data.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows; standard library usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate astrophysical data handling; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, securityRisk=0.9 (slightly higher but justified given data handling). But since no malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 might be more appropriate, but 0.9 is somewhat overstated.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines class, reads header info, spectral data.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, securityRisk=0.1. This seems appropriate; the slight securityRisk is justified by reading external data but is minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose; loads data from FITS.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate spectral modeling code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, securityRisk=0.0. Slightly more confident, but consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; reads FITS, manages thermal parameters.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, securityRisk=0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. **Consensus: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation detected. **Consensus: 0.0**\n- **Risk Score:** The code performs data reading and processing typical for scientific software. No security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Slightly elevated securityRisk in some reports (0.1), justified by reading external data, but overall very low.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal security risk due to external data loading, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The slightly higher securityRisk scores (0.1) are justified given external data handling, but overall, the code does not pose a real security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0            |\n| Risk           | 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review: the code is a legitimate scientific utility with no malicious or security concerns.",
