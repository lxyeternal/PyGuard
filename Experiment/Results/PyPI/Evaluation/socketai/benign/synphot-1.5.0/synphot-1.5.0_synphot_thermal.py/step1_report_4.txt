{
  "purpose": "Defines a thermal spectral element class for spectral modeling with thermal properties, including methods for creating a spectrum based on blackbody radiation and loading from FITS files.",
  "sources": "Reads header data from FITS files (`fits.getheader`) and spectral data from `specio.read_spec` which reads spectral tables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or sent over network, nor is there any code executing external commands or writing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Header info (temperature, beam fill factor) flows from FITS file to object creation; spectral data points flow from `specio.read_spec` into the class, and then used in `thermal_source` method to generate spectrum.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are evident. The only potential anomaly is reliance on external spectral data files, which is standard for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for thermal spectral elements, with properties for temperature and beam filling factor. It includes methods to generate a spectrum and to load parameters from FITS files. The data flow involves reading header information and spectral data from external FITS files, which is typical for spectral modeling modules. No suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors is evident. The code relies on standard libraries and functions, with proper validation of input quantities. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate part of a spectral analysis library for astrophysical data, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs expected operations related to spectral modeling and data loading without any suspicious activity.",
