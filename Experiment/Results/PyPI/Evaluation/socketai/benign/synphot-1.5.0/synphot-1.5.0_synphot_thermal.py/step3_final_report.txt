{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for thermal spectral elements, enabling creation and manipulation of spectra with associated temperature and beam filling factor parameters, including loading from FITS files.",
  "sources": "Reads FITS headers via fits.getheader and spectral data via specio.read_spec, accessing external FITS files specified by filename.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data flows are limited to reading files and creating spectrum objects; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Header info and spectral data are read from FITS files, then used to instantiate and configure the spectral element object.",
  "anomalies": "Uses is_fits with an empty string as the first argument, which is unconventional; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard astrophysical utility for modeling thermal spectra, performing input validation, reading data from trusted sources, and constructing spectrum objects. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of is_fits with an empty string is unusual but not harmful. The spectral data handling and validation are appropriate for scientific software. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to external data files, which are typical in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific module with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minimal security risk stems from external data loading, which is standard in scientific workflows. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and context.",
