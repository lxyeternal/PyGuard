{
  "purpose": "Define a thermal spectral element class with methods for creating and applying thermal source spectra, loading from FITS files, and managing thermal parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from FITS files via astropy.io.fits and specio.read_spec; parameters are set via class initialization and property setters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code does not send data externally or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from FITS file headers into class attributes; the thermal_source method generates a spectrum object from internal parameters; no external or untrusted data flow beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code uses standard library functions and typical class design. No hidden backdoors or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for thermal spectral elements with properties for temperature and beam fill factor, including input validation. It reads configuration from FITS files with specified headers and constructs spectrum objects. No external data is sent over the network or manipulated in suspicious ways. Usage of astropy and synphot libraries appears standard. No malicious patterns or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for spectral modeling with no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It safely loads data from FITS files, manages thermal parameters, and generates spectra. No suspicious behaviors are evident.",
