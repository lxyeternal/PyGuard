{
  "purpose": "The code provides user authentication, password management, and session handling functionalities for a Django REST framework-based application.",
  "sources": "Input data from POST requests (e.g., username, password, token, email), request objects, and imported settings or models.",
  "sinks": "Token generation, cookie setting/deletion, user login/logout, and serializer validation.",
  "flows": "User input flows through serializer validation to token generation or password reset functions, then affects cookies, user sessions, or responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of JWT tokens, session cookies, and standard Django authentication appears typical. No unusual data leaks, code injections, or privacy violations identified. Sensitive parameters are properly decorated, reducing risk of accidental exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to standard Django REST framework patterns for authentication workflows. It handles token-based and session-based login/logout, password resets, and user detail management. Sensitive POST parameters are decorated to prevent logging exposure. No code indicates malicious behavior or sabotage. External dependencies (e.g., jwt_encode, serializers, models) are used appropriately. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks observed. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of authentication endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard authentication workflows without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs common security practices, including parameter decoration, token handling, and session management. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this review.",
