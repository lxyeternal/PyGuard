  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, scoring, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Django REST framework authentication implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code follows best practices. The use of `jwt_encode`, token creation, cookie handling, and sensitive parameter decoration are all standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard authentication workflows, no malicious code, proper handling of tokens and passwords.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code's structure. No issues or suspicious activity detected. The malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard login, logout, password reset, user detail retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No anomalies or obfuscation. The malware score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard authentication and user management, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard workflows, proper handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (lower than others, indicating higher confidence)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-implemented authentication module. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard security practices without known vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure, practices, and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscation and Malware:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  Given the consistent and thorough analysis, I agree with the scores assigned in all reports:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: approximately 0.1-0.2\n\n- **My Own Estimate:**  \n  I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard, secure implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should remain at **0, 0, and ~0.1-0.2** respectively.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is secure, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. No changes needed.",
