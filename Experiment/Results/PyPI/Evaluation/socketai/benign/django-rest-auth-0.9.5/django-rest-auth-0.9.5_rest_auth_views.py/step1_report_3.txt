{
  "purpose": "This code provides user authentication, session management, and password handling functionalities for a Django REST Framework-based API, including login, logout, user detail retrieval, and password reset/change.",
  "sources": "Input data from POST requests (username, password, email, token, uid, new_passwords), request object for user context, and request cookies.",
  "sinks": "JWT tokens and session cookies (setting/deleting), token objects stored in database, and response data serialization.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request data to serializer validation; validated data then triggers login, token creation, or password reset; tokens are stored or sent via cookies; logout deletes tokens and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Usage of JWT cookies and token management appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution identified. No suspicious backdoors or hidden data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard authentication workflows: login with token or JWT, logout removing tokens and cookies, user detail retrieval, and password management. It uses Django and DRF conventions properly. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code practices are visible. The JWT cookie handling aligns with best practices, and sensitive parameters are decorated to prevent logging. Overall, the logic and flow appear legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical user authentication module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to best practices and does not contain hidden malicious behaviors or obfuscation. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
