{
  "purpose": "The code provides user authentication, session management, password reset, and user details update functionalities for a Django REST framework-based API.",
  "sources": "Input data from request.data in login, password reset, password change, and password reset confirm endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Response serialization; setting and deleting cookies for JWT tokens; user authentication and logout functions.",
  "flows": "User input flows from request.data to serializers, then to login or password reset functions; token generation and cookie setting; user data retrieval and update.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; use of standard Django and DRF functions; token handling appears typical. No unusual or suspicious network activity, file operations, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard user authentication workflows using Django and DRF conventions. Sensitive post parameters are correctly decorated, reducing risk of accidental logging. Token management utilizes JWT or token models, with cookies handled securely if configured. Logout clears tokens and cookies appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No signs of malicious code or behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The code’s structure and logic follow common authentication patterns and do not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of user authentication and management endpoints. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. It follows standard practices and does not contain signs of malware or intentional security flaws.",
