{
  "purpose": "This code provides user authentication, session management, password reset, and user details endpoints for a Django REST Framework application, facilitating login, logout, user info retrieval/update, and password management.",
  "sources": "Input data from request.data for login, password reset, password change, and password reset confirmation; user data from request.user.",
  "sinks": "JWT token generation (jwt_encode), setting cookies for JWT tokens, deleting auth tokens, and saving password updates.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request.data to serializers; validated data leads to token creation or password update; tokens are set in responses or cookies; logout deletes tokens and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation. No unusual network activity, code injections, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard user authentication workflows using Django and DRF, with optional JWT support. Sensitive parameters like passwords are decorated to prevent logging. Tokens are generated securely, and cookies are set with appropriate security flags. Logout clears tokens and cookies properly. User details are fetched from the authenticated user object. No hidden or malicious code paths or suspicious behaviors are identified. Usage of external JWT settings and token creation functions appears standard. Overall, the code adheres to common security practices and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements typical authentication and user management functions with proper handling of sensitive data, session tokens, and cookies. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation.",
