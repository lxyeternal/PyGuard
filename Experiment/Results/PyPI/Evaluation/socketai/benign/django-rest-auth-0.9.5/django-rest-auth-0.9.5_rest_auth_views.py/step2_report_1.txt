  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is standard Django REST framework authentication code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors/flaws?**  \n  None identified. The reasoning aligns with best practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — appropriate, no malicious behavior detected.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — code appears clear and standard.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.2 — low, given the standard implementation.\n\n- **Justification for scores:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code follows typical patterns, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors/flaws?**  \n  None apparent. The reasoning correctly dismisses malicious concerns.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — code is clear.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.2 — low, standard implementation.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The implementation is standard for Django REST framework authentication.\n\n- **Errors/flaws?**  \n  None identified.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.2 — low, standard practices.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious or suspicious activity observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is typical for user auth flows.\n\n- **Errors/flaws?**  \n  None detected.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malware suspected.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.2 — low.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code handles authentication securely and normally.\n\n- **Errors/flaws?**  \n  None apparent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malicious code.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — clear code.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.1 — very low, standard implementation.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, indicating clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, justified by the standard, secure implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, as code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** Could be marginally lowered to 0.1 for some reports, given the absence of any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity, but 0.2 remains acceptable for conservative assessment.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with current scores)",
