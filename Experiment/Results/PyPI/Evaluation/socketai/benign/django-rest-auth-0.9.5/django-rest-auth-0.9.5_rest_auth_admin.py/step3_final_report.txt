  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code is inert and non-executable.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of comments; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is entirely commented out, containing no executable statements or logic. All reports correctly identify this inactivity, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's inert state. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a placeholder or template with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inert, commented-out placeholder code with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the inactive state.",
