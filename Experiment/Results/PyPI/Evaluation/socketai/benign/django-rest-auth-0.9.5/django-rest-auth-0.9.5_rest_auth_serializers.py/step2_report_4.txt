  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard authentication, no obfuscation, and low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, overall risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's logic. The code uses standard Django patterns, proper validation, and no suspicious external calls. The only minor concern could be the dynamic import via `import_callable`, but within this scope, it appears legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard serializers, no malicious activity, uses dynamic import (`import_callable`) but appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, overall risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is typical for Django REST Framework auth modules. The mention of `import_callable` is noted but not suspicious here. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard login, password reset, token validation, no malicious behavior, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe logic is consistent with standard practices. No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The risk score reflects a low but present potential for misconfiguration, which is acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Typical authentication, password reset, token validation, no malicious activity, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The use of `import_callable` is standard for dynamic serializer selection, not suspicious here.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard serializers, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, uses `import_callable`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's logic. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, reflecting the potential for misconfiguration, especially regarding `import_callable`, but overall low.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of Django REST Framework authentication serializers.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity is evident.\n- The dynamic import utility (`import_callable`) is a common pattern for extensibility, not inherently malicious.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the potential for misconfiguration but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's logic and structure.",
