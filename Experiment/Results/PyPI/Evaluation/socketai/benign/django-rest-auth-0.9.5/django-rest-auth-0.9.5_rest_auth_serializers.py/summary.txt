  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of authentication and user management serializers in Django REST Framework. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score reflects standard practices with minimal concerns. The use of dynamic import utilities is common and not inherently dangerous. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use."
