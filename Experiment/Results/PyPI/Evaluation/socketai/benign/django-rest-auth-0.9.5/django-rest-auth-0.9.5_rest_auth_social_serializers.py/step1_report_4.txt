  "sources": "Input data from request (access_token, token_secret), request object, view attributes.",
  "sinks": "complete_social_login function call, session assignment, social login lookup/save, user assignment.",
  "flows": "Input tokens -> get_social_login -> complete_social_login -> login.lookup() -> login.save() -> user assigned in attrs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code. Uses standard Django and DRF practices.",
  "analysis": "The code handles OAuth1 login flow for Twitter, retrieving tokens from validated input, associating them with social app data, and completing login process. It saves tokens to session, invokes a standard library method to complete login, and assigns user object. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. No external network calls or data exfiltration observed. All functions used are standard and properly scoped. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard implementation of social login with Django Allauth and DRF. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks beyond normal operation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
