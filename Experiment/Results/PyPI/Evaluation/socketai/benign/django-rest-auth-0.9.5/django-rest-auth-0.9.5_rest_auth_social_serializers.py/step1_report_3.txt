  "purpose": "Serializer classes to handle Twitter social login and connection via OAuth in a Django REST Framework context.",
  "sources": "Input data from serializer fields ('access_token', 'token_secret'), request object from context, environment settings for installed apps.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted OAuth tokens and session data stored in request.session, social login completion functions, and external provider interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'access_token' and 'token_secret' flow into SocialToken object, used in 'get_social_login'. The OAuth tokens are stored in session, then used in 'complete_social_login' which finalizes authentication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. Usage of social login flow is standard, but storing OAuth tokens directly in session is a potential security concern if session storage is insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard social login handling using Django Allauth and REST Framework serializers. It retrieves tokens from input, stores them in session, and completes login via OAuth adapter. The OAuth process and token handling follow typical patterns. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. It properly handles exceptions during OAuth operations. The code's security depends on proper session management and secure transport. No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard social login flow with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It handles OAuth tokens responsibly within expected patterns. Minor security note: ensure session storage is secure. Overall, it appears safe.",
