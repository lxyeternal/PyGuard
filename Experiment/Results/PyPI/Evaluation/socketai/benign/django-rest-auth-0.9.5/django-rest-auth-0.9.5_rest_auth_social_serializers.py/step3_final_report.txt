{
  "purpose": "Implements Twitter OAuth1 social login using Django REST Framework and django-allauth, handling token exchange and user login completion.",
  "sources": "Reads 'access_token' and 'token_secret' from serializer input; accesses request object via context; stores tokens temporarily in session.",
  "sinks": "Stores OAuth tokens in session; calls external adapter methods for login completion; invokes complete_social_login which may trigger user creation or update.",
  "flows": "Input tokens -> stored in session -> used to create SocialToken -> passed to adapter.complete_login -> social login processed -> user assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls. Session storage of tokens is standard but warrants secure session management.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth1 login flow with django-allauth, with proper error handling and clear structure. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The session storage of tokens is typical but should be secured properly in deployment. No external network calls or data exfiltration are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Twitter OAuth1 login, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming proper session security. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
