  "purpose": "Serializer classes for handling Twitter social login and connection in a Django application, managing OAuth tokens and social login workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'request' object, session data ('request.session'), and input data ('attrs' for access_token and token_secret).",
  "sinks": "Assignment to 'request.session', creation of SocialToken with potentially unvalidated input, calling 'complete_social_login' with possibly unverified social data, and setting 'attrs['user']' from social login.",
  "flows": "Input data ('access_token' and 'token_secret') flow into session storage and SocialToken creation, then through 'get_social_login' which calls 'complete_login' and 'complete_social_login', leading to setting the 'user' in 'attrs'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Use of 'request.session' to store OAuth tokens is standard but can be risky if session management is insecure. No suspicious code structures or obfuscated code observed. No evident backdoors or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth social login flow: receiving tokens, storing them temporarily in session, and invoking social login completion functions. It uses 'get_social_login' to handle OAuth completion, which internally calls 'complete_login' and 'complete_social_login'. No external data is directly fetched or used insecurely. The code relies on well-known libraries (django-allauth, rest_framework). No suspicious data handling, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be a typical social login implementation without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard social login logic with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages OAuth tokens and social login flow correctly. There are no signs of malware or security risks beyond typical session handling, which should be secured properly in deployment. Overall, it appears safe.",
