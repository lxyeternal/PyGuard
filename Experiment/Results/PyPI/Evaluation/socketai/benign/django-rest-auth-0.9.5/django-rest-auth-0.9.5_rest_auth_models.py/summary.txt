  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe pattern for configurable models, with no inherent malicious intent. The primary concern is ensuring the configuration setting is secured against malicious manipulation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to reliance on external configuration."
