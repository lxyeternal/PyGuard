{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports a token model class for authentication, based on Django settings or defaults to a predefined token model.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' via getattr, which may be user-configurable.",
  "sinks": "The imported model class could be used for token creation, storage, and authentication operations.",
  "flows": "The setting value (if provided) flows into 'import_callable', which loads the token model class for subsequent use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import_callable' with a potentially user-defined setting introduces some flexibility but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and REST framework modules and then dynamically imports a token model class based on a setting. This pattern allows customizable token models, which is standard practice for flexible authentication implementations. The default token model is used if the setting is absent. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or have suspicious side-effects. The only concern is reliance on external configuration, which could be misconfigured, but this is typical for such dynamic import patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and safe pattern for dynamically importing a configurable token model in a Django project. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
