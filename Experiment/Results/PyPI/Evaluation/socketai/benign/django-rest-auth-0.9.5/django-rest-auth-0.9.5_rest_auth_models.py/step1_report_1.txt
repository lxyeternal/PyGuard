{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports a token model class based on Django settings, defaulting to a standard token model if not specified.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' via getattr on 'settings'.",
  "sinks": "The imported class (TokenModel) could potentially be used in ways that involve database operations or authentication mechanisms, but the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "flows": "The source 'settings' value is used to determine which token model class to import via import_callable, establishing a dynamic class import flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_callable to dynamically import a model class based on configuration could be misused if the configuration is maliciously altered, but in this context, it's a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and a utility function for dynamic import. It retrieves a setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' and uses 'import_callable' to import the specified class, defaulting to 'DefaultTokenModel'. The code itself is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious intent. It follows common patterns for configurable model imports in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for configurable model import in Django projects. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the code provided. The dynamic import mechanism relies on external configuration, which could pose a risk if misconfigured, but the code itself is safe.",
