  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Correctly identifies that the code dynamically imports a token model based on Django settings, defaulting to `DefaultTokenModel`.  \n- **Analysis**: The code is straightforward, safe, and follows common patterns.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - *Malware*: 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  - *SecurityRisk*: 0.2 — minimal, considering the dynamic import, but the code itself is safe.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid. No issues.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Emphasizes that using `import_callable` with a setting could be exploited if the setting is maliciously crafted.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly notes that dynamic import based on external configuration can be risky.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - *Malware*: 0 — no malicious code observed.  \n  - *SecurityRisk*: 0.3 — justified, given the potential for misconfiguration leading to malicious imports.  \n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate. The risk is acknowledged but no actual malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is balanced and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Highlights that if the setting `REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL` is compromised, malicious classes could be imported.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly identifies the supply chain risk inherent in dynamic imports based on external configuration.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - *Malware*: 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - *SecurityRisk*: 0.3 — reasonable, given the potential for configuration tampering.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid, with proper caution.\n\n**Assessment**: Well-founded and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the potential risk if the setting is maliciously altered, but notes that the pattern is common and not inherently malicious.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly recognizes the risk introduced by dynamic import but also notes the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - *Malware*: 0 — aligns with no malware present.  \n  - *SecurityRisk*: 0.4 — slightly higher, considering the potential risk if configuration is compromised.  \n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment**: Reasonable and balanced.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Considers the pattern standard and safe, with minimal risk.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly states that the code is a common pattern, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores**:  \n  - *Malware*: 0 — accurate.  \n  - *SecurityRisk*: 0.1 — low, given the controlled nature of the import.  \n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment**: Correct and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.4, reflecting the potential risk introduced by dynamic import based on external configuration.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is transparent and straightforward.  \n- **Risk**: 0.2 — moderate, considering the reliance on external configuration and the use of dynamic import, which could be exploited if misconfigured.\n\n**Final notes**: The core concern is supply chain risk due to dynamic import, but the code itself is safe and standard. Proper configuration management mitigates the risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the actual security posture of the code snippet. The primary concern is configuration integrity, not malicious code.",
