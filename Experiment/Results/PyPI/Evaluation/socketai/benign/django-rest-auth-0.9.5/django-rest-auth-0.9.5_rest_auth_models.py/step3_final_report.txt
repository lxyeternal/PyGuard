{
  "purpose": "Dynamically imports a token model class based on Django settings, defaulting to a safe model if unspecified.",
  "sources": "The setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' retrieved from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "The import_callable function executes the import based on the setting, potentially executing arbitrary code if the setting is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code reads the setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL', then passes it to import_callable, which imports the specified class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dynamic import pattern. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for configurable models in Django. The main risk arises if the 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' setting is manipulated maliciously, leading to potential code execution during import. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score reflects the supply chain risk inherent in dynamic imports based on external configuration, estimated at approximately 0.3. The code itself is safe if configuration management is secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe pattern for configurable models, with no inherent malicious intent. The primary concern is ensuring the configuration setting is secured against malicious manipulation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to reliance on external configuration.",
