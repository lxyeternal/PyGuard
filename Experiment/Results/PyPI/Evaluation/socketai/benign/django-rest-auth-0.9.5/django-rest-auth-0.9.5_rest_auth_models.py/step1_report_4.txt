  "purpose": "Configure the token model used for authentication by importing a custom model if specified, otherwise falling back to the default token model.",
  "sources": "Reading Django settings with 'getattr(settings, ...)' to determine the token model.",
  "sinks": "The 'import_callable' function potentially imports and executes code based on the setting value.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the model path from settings, then imports and assigns it to 'TokenModel'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import_callable' on a setting value introduces risk if the setting is maliciously altered; reliance on dynamic import is a potential vector for malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing Django settings and a default token model. It then imports a utility 'import_callable'. The key operation is fetching a setting 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' with a default value and dynamically importing it. If an attacker controls this setting, they could specify a malicious module or code to execute during import. This pattern is common in configurable frameworks but could be exploited if the setting is not properly secured. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code itself does not perform any network operations or file modifications. The security concern is primarily the dynamic import based on user-controlled settings, which could lead to execution of malicious code if compromised.",
  "conclusion": "This code dynamically imports a token model based on configuration, which introduces potential risk if the setting is manipulated maliciously. The overall code is not inherently malicious but relies on safe configuration practices to prevent exploitation.",
