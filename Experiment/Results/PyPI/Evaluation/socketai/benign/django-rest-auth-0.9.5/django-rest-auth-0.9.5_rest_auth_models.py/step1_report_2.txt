  "purpose": "Configure and import a customizable token model for authentication in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings via 'getattr(settings, ...)' to determine which token model to use.",
  "sinks": "The 'import_callable' function is used to dynamically import the token model, potentially executing untrusted code if the setting is manipulated maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code reads the 'REST_AUTH_TOKEN_MODEL' setting, then dynamically imports the specified model class via 'import_callable', which could execute arbitrary code if the setting is maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import_callable' with a setting value introduces a dynamic import that could be exploited if the setting value is maliciously crafted. The default fallback to 'DefaultTokenModel' appears safe if the setting is absent or controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and then attempts to dynamically import a token model based on a configuration setting. The setting value is retrieved using 'getattr', which defaults to a known safe class. The dynamic import is performed via 'import_callable', which can execute arbitrary code if the setting is maliciously configured. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior are observed. The pattern is common for customizable models but relies on safe configuration. No evidence of malware or malicious code is present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a configurable token model import, which is standard practice. While the use of 'import_callable' introduces some risk if configuration is compromised, there is no inherent malicious behavior in this code snippet itself. It is generally safe if configuration settings are properly secured.",
