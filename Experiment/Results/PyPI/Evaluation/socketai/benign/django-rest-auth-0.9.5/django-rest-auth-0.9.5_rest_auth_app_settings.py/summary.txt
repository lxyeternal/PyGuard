  "conclusion": "The code is standard for configurable Django applications, with no inherent malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that external settings are securely managed and validated to prevent malicious code execution. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are appropriate given the analysis. Overall, the code is safe when proper configuration management is enforced."
