  "obfuscated": 0.4,

  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with Report 5 presenting moderate suspicion due to described obfuscation and dynamic code features. Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made if actual code confirms or denies suspicion. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with some caution warranted for Report 5."
