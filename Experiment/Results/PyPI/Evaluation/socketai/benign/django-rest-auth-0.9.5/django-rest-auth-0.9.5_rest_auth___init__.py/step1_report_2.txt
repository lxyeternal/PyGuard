  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but the exact function is unclear without additional context. It may involve data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external data fetched via network or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write operations, or system commands that could lead to data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network calls, file operations, or system commands, possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual features include the use of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval or exec), hardcoded secrets or credentials, obfuscated or complex code structures, and any use of network communications to suspicious domains. No such anomalies are evident in the provided snippet due to the absence of actual code.",
  "analysis": "The review process indicates that the provided code is either empty or lacks executable logic. Without specific code snippets, there are no identifiable sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are apparent, but the absence of code prevents a thorough analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the lack of actual code limits confidence. Further review of the complete code is recommended if available.",
