  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided descriptions.",
  "sources": "Descriptions of code features such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, and code presence; no actual code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include eval()/exec() with untrusted data, network or file operations, and environment variable access, inferred from descriptions.",
  "flows": "Source (e.g., eval()/exec() with untrusted input) to sinks (e.g., network, file, environment variables), especially in Report 5; other reports lack explicit flows.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious features such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and use of eval()/exec() without code confirmation.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on descriptions rather than actual code snippets. Reports 1 and 5 highlight potential red flags; others suggest benign or absent code. Scores are consistent with suspicion levels, with Report 5 showing the highest concern due to eval()/exec() and obfuscation. The reasoning aligns with the described features, and scores reflect the evidence. Without concrete code, assessments are cautious, emphasizing suspicion rather than confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with Report 5 presenting moderate suspicion due to described obfuscation and dynamic code features. Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made if actual code confirms or denies suspicion. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with some caution warranted for Report 5.",
