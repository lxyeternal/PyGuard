  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading static README and defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static data read from file and passed directly to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static file reading and package configuration. It does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or suspicious code. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
