  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'django-rest-auth' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static package configuration with no dynamic or external inputs influencing runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure with no unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for long_description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no user inputs, network calls, or execution of code based on external data. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious code segments are present. The script appears safe and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies, which are common in open-source projects.",
