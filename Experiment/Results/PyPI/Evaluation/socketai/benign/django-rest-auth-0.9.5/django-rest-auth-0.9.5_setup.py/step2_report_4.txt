  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, no external data sinks, and no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The code only reads a static README file and calls `setup()` with static data. No dynamic, network, or malicious behavior is present. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes that the script is a typical setup script with static data, no external or untrusted input, and no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no suspicious or malicious behavior, just standard packaging code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous analyses.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report confirms that the code is a typical setup script with static configuration, no external data, or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** All observations align with a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Given the nature of the code, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be **0** across the board. The reports' scores are appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, a score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.  \n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Security risk score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. |\n\n**Overall, all reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code.**",
