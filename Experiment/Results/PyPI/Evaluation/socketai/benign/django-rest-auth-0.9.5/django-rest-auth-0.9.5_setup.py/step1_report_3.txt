  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'django-rest-auth', used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long_description; imports standard libraries os, setuptools, and find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code executes with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to gather description; installs dependencies; defines package metadata. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Uses standard setup procedures without obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations. It reads a static README file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. No unusual code structures or malicious indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for package distribution without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
