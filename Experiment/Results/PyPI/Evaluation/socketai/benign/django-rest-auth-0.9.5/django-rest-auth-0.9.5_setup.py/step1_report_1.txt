  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description; uses static package data and dependencies specified in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data or command execution points",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file for description, specifying dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It does not execute any untrusted input, connect to external servers, or perform any suspicious operations. There is no obfuscated or malicious code present. The code strictly adheres to standard packaging procedures and does not contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for packaging a Python library.",
