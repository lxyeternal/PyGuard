{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'django-rest-auth' with specified dependencies and metadata for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long_description, imports modules os and setuptools, and uses them to define setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or system commands executed with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads external README file to obtain description, then passes static metadata and dependencies to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is a standard setup script with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All inputs are static, and no dynamic or user-supplied data is processed. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The script functions solely to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
