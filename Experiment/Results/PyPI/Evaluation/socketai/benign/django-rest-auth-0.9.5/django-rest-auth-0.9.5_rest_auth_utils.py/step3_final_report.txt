  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamic import, token creation, and JWT encoding in Django applications.",
  "sources": "The import_callable function reads the string path or callable; the default_create_token function reads from the database; jwt_encode accesses JWT settings and encodes payloads.",
  "sinks": "The import_callable function uses import_module and getattr, which could execute arbitrary code if given untrusted input; jwt_encode processes user data through JWT handlers.",
  "flows": "Input string to import_callable leads to import_module and getattr; user object passed to jwt_payload_handler and jwt_encode_handler via jwt_encode.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with potentially untrusted input; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The import_callable function's dynamic import pattern could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but in controlled environments, this is common. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The JWT encoding uses standard library calls. The overall security risk is low but warrants caution if inputs are not sanitized. Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0.2 due to dynamic import potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and uses common patterns. The only concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious activity is evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
