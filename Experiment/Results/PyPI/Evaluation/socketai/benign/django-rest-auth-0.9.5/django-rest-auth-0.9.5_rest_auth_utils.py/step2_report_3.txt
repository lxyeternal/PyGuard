  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens, and encoding JWTs in Django. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, and the lack of obfuscation or suspicious patterns aligns with the conclusion. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n- **Score justification:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, as the only potential concern is dynamic import, which could be risky if untrusted input is passed, but there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; interactions with database and JWT settings are standard. No suspicious behavior or malware detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The functions are typical for token management in Django, and no malicious patterns are observed.\n\n- **Score justification:** The low malware and risk scores are justified. The database interaction and dynamic import are standard but should be used carefully; still, no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code allows dynamic import via 'import_callable', which could be exploited if untrusted input is used. The rest is standard JWT and token creation code. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly points out that dynamic import can be risky if input isn't sanitized, but in the context of trusted inputs, it's standard. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting potential risk if inputs are untrusted, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on dynamic import pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The pattern is common but should be used with trusted inputs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic import is a potential vector if misused, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0; risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the utility functions, emphasizing standard patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation, and the dynamic import pattern is typical but should be used carefully.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0, risk 0.2, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** Uniformly 0.2, justified by the use of dynamic import which could be risky if inputs are untrusted. Given the code context, this is a cautious but reasonable score.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — potential risk if inputs are untrusted, but no active threat.\n\nThe scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is standard utility functions used in Django applications for token and JWT handling. No malware or obfuscation is present. The only potential concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
