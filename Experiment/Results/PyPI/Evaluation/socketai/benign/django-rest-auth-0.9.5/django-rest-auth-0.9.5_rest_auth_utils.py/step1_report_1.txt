  "sources": "import_callable reads data from a string or callable; jwt_encode imports settings and processes user data.",
  "sinks": "jwt_encode uses imported settings and user data to generate a JWT token.",
  "flows": "import_callable may import modules based on user input; jwt_encode processes user data with JWT settings to produce a token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No external network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens, and encoding JWTs in a Django context. It includes standard import checks and exception handling for missing dependencies. The JWT encoding function dynamically imports settings and generates tokens based on user data, which is typical in authentication workflows. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors identified. The code's structure and flow align with common secure practices for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of utility functions used for authentication purposes in Django applications. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
