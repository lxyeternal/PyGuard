  "purpose": "Utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens, and encoding JWTs within a Django application.",
  "sources": "User-provided string path for import_callable; user object for default_create_token; user object for jwt_encode.",
  "sinks": "get_or_create method (potential database access); JWT payload and encode handlers (potential token generation or external calls).",
  "flows": "Input string or user object → import_callable and default_create_token functions, then JWT encoding process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no anomalous data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens for users, and encoding JWTs. The import_callable function safely imports a callable based on a string path, with proper attribute checks. The default_create_token function interacts with the database via get_or_create, which is standard for token management. The jwt_encode function dynamically imports settings from 'rest_framework_jwt', raising an error if missing, and then encodes a JWT for the user. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears standard and secure in context, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility module for token handling and JWT encoding within a Django environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code's structure and purpose are clear and typical for a Django project using JWTs.",
