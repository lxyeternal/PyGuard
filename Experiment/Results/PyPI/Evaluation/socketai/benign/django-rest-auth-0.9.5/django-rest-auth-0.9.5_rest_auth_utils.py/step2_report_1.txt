  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scoring appropriateness, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens, and encoding JWTs in Django. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard token creation and JWT encoding. No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies standard practices. No issues with scoring or reasoning.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights that dynamic import via `import_module` and `getattr` could be exploited if untrusted input is provided, but in the current context, it seems controlled. No malicious code detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The caution about dynamic import is valid, but since no evidence of untrusted input or malicious intent is present, the low risk score is appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that dynamic import patterns could pose risks if misused, but in this context, they are standard and controlled. No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct reasoning; the scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard utility functions with minimal risk, assuming proper input control.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly set at 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Scores:** Uniformly at 0.2, reflecting a low but cautious stance due to dynamic import patterns, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted. Given the context, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The dynamic import pattern warrants a note that if `path_or_callable` is derived from untrusted sources, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. However, in controlled environments, this is a common pattern.\n- No changes needed to scores or reasoning based on the provided information.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — considering the dynamic import, but assuming inputs are sanitized, this is acceptable.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with minimal inherent risk related to dynamic import patterns, which are standard but should be used cautiously with untrusted input.",
