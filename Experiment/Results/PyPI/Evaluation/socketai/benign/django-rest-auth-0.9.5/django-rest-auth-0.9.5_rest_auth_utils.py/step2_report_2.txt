  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Utility functions for importing callables, creating user tokens, and encoding JWTs. No malicious code or obfuscation detected. High confidence (0.9), malware (0), security risk (0.2).\n\n- **Code confirmation**: The code matches the description. No issues found.\n\n- **Scores**: The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Security risk of 0.2 is reasonable given the dynamic import pattern, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The report's reasoning is sound. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar utility functions; interactions with database and JWT settings. No suspicious behavior, standard code.\n\n- **Code confirmation**: Matches the code snippet. No issues.\n\n- **Scores**: Malware score at 0 is appropriate. Security risk at 0.2 is acceptable, considering the dynamic import pattern.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Well-reasoned, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Emphasizes that 'import_callable' allows dynamic import, which could be exploited if untrusted input is passed, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n- **Code confirmation**: The function does perform dynamic import via 'import_module' and 'getattr' based on user input.\n\n- **Analysis**: The key concern is that 'import_callable' can execute arbitrary code if 'path_or_callable' is untrusted. This is a common security consideration.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — no malware present.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — appropriate, given the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The report correctly identifies the potential risk but does not claim malicious activity. The dynamic import is a standard pattern but warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous, notes that dynamic import could be exploited if inputs are untrusted but is a common pattern.\n\n- **Code confirmation**: Confirmed.\n\n- **Scores**: Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2, consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Reiterates the standard utility functions, dynamic import pattern, and that no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Code confirmation**: Matches.\n\n- **Scores**: Malware 0, security risk 0.2, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score**: Uniformly 0.2 across reports, reflecting potential risk if untrusted input is passed to 'import_callable'. This is reasonable given the pattern.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The dynamic import pattern, while common, should be highlighted as a potential security concern if 'path_or_callable' is not sanitized or controlled. However, since no malicious activity is detected, the scores are appropriate.\n\n- The overall scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score**: **0.2** (potential risk with dynamic import if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments necessary. The code is standard utility code with a known pattern that could be risky if misused but is not malicious in itself.",
