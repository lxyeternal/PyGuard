  "purpose": "Utility functions for importing callables, creating tokens, and encoding JWT tokens in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters (path_or_callable, token_model, user).",
  "sinks": "import_module (dynamic import), getattr (attribute access), jwt_encode (JWT encoding).",
  "flows": "Input paths or objects to import_callable, user objects to default_create_token, user to jwt_encode, and JWT settings to encode tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with import_module and getattr could potentially be exploited if input is untrusted, but used here with controlled paths; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No evidence of obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'import_callable' dynamically imports a callable from a string, 'default_create_token' creates or retrieves a user token, and 'jwt_encode' encodes a user into a JWT using REST framework settings. The dynamic import uses 'import_module' and 'getattr' on a provided string, which is a common pattern but should only be used with trusted input. The JWT encoding relies on settings from 'rest_framework_jwt', which is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network or file operations, and no obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the dynamic import, which could be misused if inputs are not sanitized, but in typical usage, this is controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for a Django project involving token handling and JWT encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws in this snippet. The dynamic import pattern is common but should be used carefully with trusted inputs. Overall, the code is safe.",
