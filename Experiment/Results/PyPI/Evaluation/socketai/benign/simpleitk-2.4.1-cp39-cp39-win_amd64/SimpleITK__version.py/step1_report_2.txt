{
  "purpose": "Constructs a version string for the software based on predefined version components and conditions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version components (sitk_major, sitk_minor, etc.) within the function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only constructs and returns a version string.",
  "flows": "Variables are combined sequentially to form the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, dynamic input, or external data sources are used. The code appears straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The function _get_pep386version() combines hardcoded version components into a string following PEP 386 format. No external input, user data, or environment variables are read. The version components are statically defined within the function, and the logic strictly handles string concatenation for version formatting. The code appears to serve a versioning purpose only, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version string generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not interact with untrusted data, network, or system resources beyond string assembly.",
