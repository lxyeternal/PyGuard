  "purpose": "Constructs a PEP 386 compliant version string for the software based on various version components.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version components within the function (_get_pep386version). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Returns the constructed version string; no sink involving untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "The function builds a version string from hardcoded variables and returns it; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code is straightforward string concatenation with static variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version components and constructs a version string based on these values. It uses simple string concatenation without any external input, dynamic execution, or cryptographic operations. The conditional logic is static and does not incorporate user input or environment variables. The code includes licensing comments and standard documentation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for version string construction with no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks identified.",
