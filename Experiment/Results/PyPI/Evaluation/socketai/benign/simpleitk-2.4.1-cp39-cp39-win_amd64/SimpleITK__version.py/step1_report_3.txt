{
  "purpose": "Constructs a PEP 386 compliant version string based on preset version components.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded version component variables within the function _get_pep386version.",
  "sinks": "Returns the constructed version string; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Concatenates hardcoded version components into a version string; no external data flow or untrusted source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded hash and version components; no dynamic or external inputs. The condition 'if sitk_hash and \"ON\" not in ['1', 'ON']:' is redundant because 'sitk_hash' is a constant string, and the check is fixed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a version string from fixed, hardcoded variables. The version components are static and do not involve user input or external sources. The only conditional logic is straightforward and predictable. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is a simple version string builder used for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string generator based on hardcoded version components with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard, safe component for version management.",
