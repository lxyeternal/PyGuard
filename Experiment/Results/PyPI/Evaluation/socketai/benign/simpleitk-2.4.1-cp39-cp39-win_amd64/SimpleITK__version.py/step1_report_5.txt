  "purpose": "Constructs a version string based on configured version components for a Python package, adhering to PEP 386 standards.",
  "sources": "Variables defining version components (sitk_major, sitk_minor, sitk_patch, etc.).",
  "sinks": "String concatenation to form the version string; no external data input or output points identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version components -> Conditional concatenation of components -> Final version string returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and relies on hardcoded version components. The condition involving 'sitk_hash' and the string 'ON' is redundant, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as static strings, constructs a version string through conditional concatenation, and returns it. There are no inputs, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The check 'if sitk_hash and \"ON\" not in [\"1\", \"ON\"]' is always true unless 'sitk_hash' is empty or 'ON' is present, but it does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the logic is static and does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely constructs a version string from hardcoded components without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is benign and intended for version formatting.",
