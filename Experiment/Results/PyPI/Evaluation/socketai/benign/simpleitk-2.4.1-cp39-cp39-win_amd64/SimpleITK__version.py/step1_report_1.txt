  "purpose": "Constructs a version string for a software package based on predefined variables.",
  "sources": "Variables within the function (_get_pep386version) such as sitk_major, sitk_minor, sitk_patch, sitk_tweak, sitk_rc, sitk_post, sitk_dev, sitk_hash.",
  "sinks": "The return statement of _get_pep386version, which outputs the version string.",
  "flows": "Variables are concatenated sequentially within _get_pep386version() to form a version string, which is then assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded version component variables; no input validation or external data sources; the condition 'if sitk_hash and \"ON\" not in [\"1\", \"ON\"]' appears redundant since '\"ON\"' is not in ['1', 'ON'] unless explicitly set otherwise, but it's a benign check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a version string from hardcoded variables. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or user inputs. The logic involves simple string concatenation with conditional checks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The only concern could be the static nature of the version info, but this does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely generating a version string from static variables. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
