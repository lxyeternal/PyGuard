{
  "purpose": "Provides image processing utilities using SimpleITK, including functions for resampling, Gaussian smoothing, reading/writing images, and conversions with numpy.",
  "sources": "File input/output, numpy array conversions, internal function calls, image data flows from files or numpy arrays into SimpleITK Image objects and vice versa.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; data flows are confined within file I/O and in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "File/array input -> Image object -> processing functions -> output images or numpy arrays; no external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for image processing with well-known libraries (SimpleITK, numpy). It performs typical tasks such as reading/writing images, resampling, Gaussian filtering, and array conversions. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The functions rely on trusted libraries and follow common practices. Data flows are typical for image processing workflows, with no external network activity or data leaks. The numpy dependencies are optional and used solely for array conversions, which is standard in scientific computing. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe image processing utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its functionality and behavior.",
