{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for image processing tasks using SimpleITK, including resampling, reading, writing, and filtering images.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as file paths for image files, image objects passed to functions, and numpy arrays converted into images.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file writing functions (WriteImage), which could be used to write malicious data to disk, and network-related modules are not present. There are no direct network or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like file paths or numpy arrays through processing functions, such as ReadImage or GetImageFromArray, into image objects; these are then processed or saved via functions like WriteImage. There are no suspicious or unusual data flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code primarily relies on well-known libraries and standard image processing techniques. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted libraries such as SimpleITK and numpy, and provides clear, documented functions for image processing workflows. No evidence of malicious behavior like code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The functions perform standard operations: reading images, processing them, and saving results. No network operations or system commands are present. The code is well-structured and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image processing utility module using SimpleITK, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It solely provides functions for reading, processing, and writing medical or scientific images.",
