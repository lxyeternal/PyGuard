  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting limited or absent suspicious features. Minor adjustments to the security risk score (from 0.2 to 0.1) in reports with code presence could improve accuracy. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and justified given the available information."
