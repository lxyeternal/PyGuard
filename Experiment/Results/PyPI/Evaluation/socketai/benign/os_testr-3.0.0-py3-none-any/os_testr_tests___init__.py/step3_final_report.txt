  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided summaries.",
  "sources": "No specific code provided; analysis based on report descriptions and context.",
  "sinks": "Not explicitly detailed; potential data flows inferred from code behavior descriptions (e.g., environment variables, dynamic imports).",
  "flows": "No concrete source-to-sink paths available due to lack of code; inferred potential flows involve environment variables and dynamic imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports mention dynamic imports and environment variables but no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code content, with benign descriptions. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting no obfuscation. Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.3), with Report 3's slightly higher risk (0.3) justified by dynamic imports and environment variables, though no actual malicious activity is observed. Confidence levels are appropriate, higher where code clarity exists. Minor adjustment suggested for Report 3's risk score from 0.3 to 0.2 to better match the benign nature of the code, but current scores are generally reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with their descriptions, indicating no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Risk scores are appropriately low, with a slight conservative adjustment for dynamic features in Report 3 recommended. Overall, the dependency appears benign based on the summaries provided.",
