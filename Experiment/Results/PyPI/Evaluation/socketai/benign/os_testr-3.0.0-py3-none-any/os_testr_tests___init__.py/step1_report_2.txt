  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user input, environment variables, or external files, but no explicit source points are clearly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or file writes if present, but no suspicious or insecure operations are evident in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to processing functions, then potentially to output or external systems, but no malicious flow is apparent based on the current code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden network communications, or malicious payloads. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No dangerous functions or insecure data handling are visible. The code structure and content suggest routine functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks in this code snippet. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
