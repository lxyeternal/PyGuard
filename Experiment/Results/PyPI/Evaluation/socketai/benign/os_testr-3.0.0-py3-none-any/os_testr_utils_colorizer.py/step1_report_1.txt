  "purpose": "Provide classes to add color to terminal output, with support detection for platform capabilities.",
  "sources": "The 'stream' object passed during class instantiation; uses sys.stdout by default.",
  "sinks": "The stream's write() method, which outputs colored or plain text.",
  "flows": "Input (text and color) flows from method call to stream.write() either with added ANSI escape sequences or plain text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard platform detection methods and ANSI codes. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: AnsiColorizer and NullColorizer. AnsiColorizer determines if terminal supports color using curses and platform checks, then writes colored text using ANSI escape codes. NullColorizer outputs plain text without modifications. No external inputs or untrusted data handling; no suspicious code or behavior. The import of curses and platform checks are standard for terminal capability detection. The code only interacts with the provided stream object for output. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements terminal color support and fallback without any malicious behavior. It performs platform checks and outputs colored or plain text accordingly. No security risks or malware indications identified.",
