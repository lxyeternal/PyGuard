{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for colorizing terminal output, either with ANSI escape codes or as a null operation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, and uses sys.stdout as default stream; uses curses module to check terminal capabilities.",
  "sinks": "Writes colorized or plain text to the provided stream object.",
  "flows": "stream is passed into classes, then used in write() methods; supported() methods read stream properties and import curses to determine capabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Use of curses module is standard for terminal capabilities detection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for colorizing terminal output. AnsiColorizer uses ANSI escape codes for coloring, checking terminal capabilities via curses and stream properties. NullColorizer provides a no-op version that simply writes text. Both classes rely on standard libraries and perform expected operations without unusual behavior. No input/output data leaks, no external network activity, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for terminal color output handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security threats.",
