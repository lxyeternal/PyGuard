{
  "purpose": "Provide terminal text colorization support via stream wrappers, enabling colored output if supported.",
  "sources": "Input stream provided during class initialization; checks for terminal capabilities via sys.stdout or other streams.",
  "sinks": "Writes colored or plain text to the stream via the write method.",
  "flows": "The write method takes text and color input, then writes to the stream, potentially with color codes if supported.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard libraries with no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for colorizing terminal output based on stream capabilities. The AnsiColorizer checks for terminal support, imports curses, and conditionally applies color codes. NullColorizer provides plain output. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic for terminal coloring.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility module for terminal output coloring with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The implementation is standard, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious code present.",
