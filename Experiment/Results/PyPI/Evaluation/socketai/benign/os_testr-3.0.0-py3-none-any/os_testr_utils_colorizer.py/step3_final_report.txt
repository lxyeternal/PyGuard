{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal color support with environment detection for ANSI escape sequences, falling back to plain text if unsupported.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout (via stream parameter), checks stream.isatty(), imports curses for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to the provided stream; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Checks stream support -> determines if coloring is supported -> writes colored or plain text to stream.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a terminal colorizer with environment detection using isatty() and curses. It outputs ANSI escape sequences for supported terminals and plain text otherwise. No external inputs, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code is well-documented, uses standard libraries, and performs safe environment checks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of terminal coloring support with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
