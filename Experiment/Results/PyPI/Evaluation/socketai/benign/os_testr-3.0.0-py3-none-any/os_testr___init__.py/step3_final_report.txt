  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version string of the 'os_testr' package using pbr.version.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and creation of VersionInfo object for 'os_testr'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version string to __version__, no untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> create VersionInfo('os_testr') -> call version_string() -> assign to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard version management library, retrieves the version string for 'os_testr', and assigns it to __version__. It involves no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, clear, and follows common practices. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. Scores across reports consistently indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk. The code's benign nature is well-supported by the simplicity and standard pattern used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for package version retrieval with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its straightforward functionality.",
