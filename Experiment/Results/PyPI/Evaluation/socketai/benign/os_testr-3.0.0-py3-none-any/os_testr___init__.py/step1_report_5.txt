  "purpose": "Retrieve and define the version string for the package 'os_testr' using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pbr.version; usage of pbr.version.VersionInfo to get version info.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, which is a standard practice for package versioning; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> Create VersionInfo object -> Access version_string -> Assign to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard versioning library without suspicious manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pbr.version' module, which is a common package versioning utility. It then creates a VersionInfo object for 'os_testr' and assigns its version string to __version__. This is typical in Python packaging for version management. No untrusted input sources, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for version retrieval in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
