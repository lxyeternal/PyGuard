{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the subunit2html module, verifying class parsing, result sorting, and report generation, including handling non-ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "Imports, test data, exception info via sys.exc_info()",
  "sinks": "None; internal data handling only, no external sinks or data leaks",
  "flows": "Data flows internally within test functions; no external data flow or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is standard test code that exercises class parsing, sorting, and report generation. It captures exception info for testing purposes but does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The use of exception info is typical for tests. Overall, the code is benign and intended solely for testing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
