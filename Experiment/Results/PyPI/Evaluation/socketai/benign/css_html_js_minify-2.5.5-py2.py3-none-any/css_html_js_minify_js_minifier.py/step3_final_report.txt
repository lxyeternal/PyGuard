  "purpose": "JavaScript minification by removing comments and whitespace to optimize code size.",
  "sources": "Input JavaScript string, read via StringIO; comment patterns and code strings within functions.",
  "sinks": "Output stream where minified code is written; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source: raw JS string; through comment removal and string manipulations; sink: minified JS output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a benign print statement about future support; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard minification routines with regex-based comment removal and string processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external interactions are present. The print statement is informational and not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward JavaScript minifier with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing security risk scores of approximately 0.1 are overly conservative; they should be adjusted to 0, reflecting the benign nature. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
