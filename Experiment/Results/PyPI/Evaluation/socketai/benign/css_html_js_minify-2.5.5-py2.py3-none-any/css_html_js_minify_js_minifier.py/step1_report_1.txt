  "purpose": "This code provides functions and a class to minify JavaScript code by removing comments, unnecessary spaces, and line breaks.",
  "sources": "Input JavaScript code passed to functions such as remove_commented_lines, js_minify_keep_comments, js_minify_keep_comments, and the class methods.",
  "sinks": "The code writes minified JavaScript output via StringIO's write method; no direct data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input JavaScript data flows through removal of comments and whitespace, resulting in compressed JavaScript string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior present. The print statement indicates deprecated or unsupported future support, which is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs code minification tasks, including removing comments and whitespace, and does not interact with external systems, network, or sensitive data. It processes strings and streams within controlled functions. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate JavaScript minification utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes JavaScript code for size reduction. The print statement about future support is informational, not malicious.",
