  "purpose": "Provides functions and a class for minifying JavaScript code, including removing comments and whitespace for optimized delivery.",
  "sources": "Reads input JavaScript code through string inputs and file-like objects (StringIO). No external input sources are directly used within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Outputs minified JavaScript code via StringIO streams or return values; no unsafe data sinks like network connections, file writes, or external system calls are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input JS strings are processed through comment removal, simple replacements, and minification functions, then returned or written to streams. No external data or untrusted inputs are explicitly handled or propagated to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses regex for comment removal and basic string manipulation, which are standard. The only notable message is a print statement warning about future support, which is harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to minify JavaScript code by removing comments, condensing semicolons, and converting multi-line scripts into single lines. The main class handles stream-based minification with attention to comment blocks, quotes, and whitespace. No network operations, code injection, or credential handling is present. The print statement about unsupported features is benign and does not influence security. Overall, the code performs standard minification without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate JavaScript minifier with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely processes JavaScript code for minification purposes without engaging in any dangerous operations.",
