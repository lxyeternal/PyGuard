  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class for minifying JavaScript code, including removing comments, condensing code, and formatting it into a single line.",
  "sources": "The code reads input JavaScript strings via function parameters, particularly in functions like js_minify and class methods like minify, which read from input streams.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs minified JavaScript to string buffers and standard output; no external data sinks are present that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input JavaScript strings are processed through removal of comments and minification functions, with flow from input functions through cleaning, minification, and output functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated language features, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The print statement indicates a deprecated support for future features, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to minify JavaScript code, removing comments, condensing code, and formatting it into a single line. It includes functions to strip comment lines, replace simple patterns, and a class for more comprehensive minification, including handling of quotes, comments, whitespace, and regex literals. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The print statement about future support appears informational and does not influence functionality. Overall, the code performs its stated purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JavaScript minifier with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It processes input JavaScript strings for minification purposes only, with no external or hidden malicious actions.",
