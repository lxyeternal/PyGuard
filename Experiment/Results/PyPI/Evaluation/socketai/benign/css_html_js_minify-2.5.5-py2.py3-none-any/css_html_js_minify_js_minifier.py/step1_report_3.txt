  "purpose": "Provides functions to minify and process JavaScript code, including comment removal and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input JavaScript code passed as strings to functions such as js_minify and js_minify_keep_comments.",
  "sinks": "Processed JavaScript output; no direct sinks for untrusted data in this code itself.",
  "flows": "Input JavaScript -> remove_commented_lines -> js_minify_keep_comments -> js_minify -> output JavaScript string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard regex for comment removal and standard minification techniques. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed. Debug print statements are present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a JavaScript minifier with functions to remove comments, replace certain patterns, and minify code into a single line. It uses regex for comment removal, StringIO for string manipulation, and a class to process minification with attention to quotes, comments, and whitespace. No obfuscated code, no network calls, no suspicious data handling. The only notable activity is a print statement indicating future support limitations, which is benign. Overall, the code performs a standard minification process with no malicious or maliciously intended behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign JavaScript minifier with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It processes input JavaScript code for size reduction and formatting, with no suspicious activities or security risks detected.",
