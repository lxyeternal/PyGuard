{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for minifying and cleaning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content, mainly for improving webpage performance and size reduction.",
  "sources": "Input HTML content passed to functions such as html_minify, condense_html_whitespace, remove_html_comments, unquote_html_attributes.",
  "sinks": "The functions manipulate strings and do not write data to external sources or perform network operations. No sinks involve untrusted data affecting system security directly.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data is processed through multiple transformation functions that modify and clean the content; there are no external data flows or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses regex-based string processing which appears standard for minification purposes. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of HTML/CSS/JS minification and cleaning functions. It performs regex-based replacements and cleanup, with some validation for HTML tags. The removal of comments, unquoting attributes, and whitespace condensing are typical optimization steps. No external data connections, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The functions are designed for safe text manipulation, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of HTML/CSS/JS minification functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malware or suspicious behaviors and functions purely as a text processing utility.",
