{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to minify and clean HTML content, including condensing whitespace, removing comments, and simplifying tags for CSS and JS.",
  "sources": "Input HTML string passed to functions such as html_minify, condense_html_whitespace, remove_html_comments, unquote_html_attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe modifications to HTML that could affect rendering or security if the HTML content is maliciously crafted, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are performed.",
  "flows": "Input HTML is processed through various transformations, including comment removal, tag cleaning, whitespace condensing, and attribute unquoting; no external data or untrusted sources are directly fetched or sent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains functions that modify HTML markup in ways that could potentially be exploited if the input HTML is maliciously crafted, such as removing quotes or comments, but these are standard minification practices. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The function remove_html_comments can leave conditional comments for IE intact if needed, but currently, it strips all comments. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of utility functions for minifying HTML, including whitespace condensing, comment removal, and attribute unquoting. The code uses regex-based parsing and replacements, which are common in minification tools. There are no network operations, no external dependencies beyond standard libraries, and no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only concern is that some transformations may alter HTML behavior if input is maliciously crafted, but these are typical for minification. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard HTML minification utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manipulates HTML content safely for its intended purpose. No malware or suspicious anomalies detected.",
