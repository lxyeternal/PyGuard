{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for minifying and cleaning HTML content by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant tags, as well as condensing style and script tags for HTML optimization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, primarily 'html' strings passed to functions such as 'html_minify', 'condense_html_whitespace', 'remove_html_comments', and 'unquote_html_attributes'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform any network operations; it solely processes and returns modified HTML strings. No sinks are evident for untrusted data leading to external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('html' strings) through various processing functions that manipulate the string content and ultimately return the minified or cleaned HTML. There are no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The functions perform straightforward regex-based and string replacement operations. The regex patterns are standard for HTML processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple HTML processing functions aimed at minifying or cleaning HTML code, including whitespace condensation, comment removal, tag simplification, and attribute unquoting. All operations are string manipulations using regex and replacements. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to HTML optimization without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No suspicious external calls or hidden logic are present. The code structure and functions are consistent with a utility module for HTML minification.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for HTML minification and cleanup, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on string input and output, with no external system interactions or suspicious patterns.",
