{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for minifying and cleaning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets, primarily aimed at reducing size and improving readability.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML string passed to functions like html_minify, condense_html_whitespace, remove_html_comments, unquote_html_attributes.",
  "sinks": "Processes the HTML string to produce a cleaned, minified version; no direct data sinks are evident for malicious data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows through multiple cleaning functions; no untrusted data flow leads to potentially dangerous actions or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; the functions perform straightforward regex replacements and string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script employs regex-based transformations to condense whitespace, remove comments, and adjust HTML attributes. It manages HTML tags and comments carefully, ensuring structure is maintained. No code indicates external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The functions are typical for HTML minification with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard HTML/CSS/JS minification utility with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe from supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage based on the provided content.",
