  "purpose": "Provides functions for minifying HTML content by condensing whitespace, removing comments, cleaning unneeded tags, and unquoting attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML input strings, processes via regex and string replacements.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network interactions; string manipulations only.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> regex/string operations -> minified HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML minification tasks using regex and string replacements. It does not execute external code, connect to networks, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The functions are straightforward and typical for such utilities. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The regex-based modifications could, in theory, affect HTML rendering if input is maliciously crafted, but this is expected for minifiers and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTML/CSS/JS minification utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects minimal potential for misuse, consistent with the code's functionality.",
