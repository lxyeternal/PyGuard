{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to minify and clean HTML content by condensing whitespace, removing comments, and simplifying tags.",
  "sources": "The functions read HTML input from function arguments, such as 'html' parameter in 'html_minify' and other functions; regex patterns compile and match content within the HTML.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and modifies the HTML string; potential sinks include regex substitutions that could be manipulated with malicious HTML or embedded scripts, though no direct network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows through various transformation functions—removal of comments, whitespace condensing, tag simplification, and attribute unquoting—culminating in the 'html_minify' output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code structures detected. The code uses standard regex for HTML processing and basic string replacements without obfuscation or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external communication found.",
  "analysis": "The script performs HTML minification through regex-based manipulations, which are straightforward and typical for such tools. The functions are designed for cleaning and compressing HTML content, with no evidence of malicious intent. The use of regex patterns appears safe, and there are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code might be part of a larger build or optimization process but alone does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML minification utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes HTML content safely, with no network interactions or obfuscated code. Overall, the script appears safe and benign.",
