{
  "purpose": "This module defines CSS color constants and a text block of CSS properties, likely used for CSS processing or minification.",
  "sources": "Constants for color definitions (EXTENDED_NAMED_COLORS), static string containing CSS properties (CSS_PROPS_TEXT)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not interact with external input or perform any data processing that could lead to leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data is statically defined within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The data structures and string constants are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a dictionary defining color names mapped to RGB tuples and a large string of CSS properties. There are no functions, dynamic executions, input/output operations, or external data handling. It does not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulate data. The code appears to be static data used for CSS processing purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign collection of CSS-related constants and strings without any malicious or security-compromising features. It poses no threat and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
