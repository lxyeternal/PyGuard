  "purpose": "Defines CSS color variables and properties for CSS processing and minification.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static data structures and string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions: a dictionary of named colors with RGB tuples and a large string listing CSS properties. There are no input operations, dynamic code execution, network activities, or external dependencies. No obfuscated code, no use of eval or exec, no apparent malicious behavior. The content appears to be standard for a CSS minification utility. The code does not perform any operations beyond data definition, and all elements are benign.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely static data for CSS processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and contains no malware or security vulnerabilities.",
