  "purpose": "Static definitions of extended named colors and CSS properties for CSS processing.",
  "sources": "Dictionary 'EXTENDED_NAMED_COLORS' and string 'CSS_PROPS_TEXT' containing CSS property names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data used as constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static data without dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures: a dictionary of color names to RGB tuples and a large string of CSS property names. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the static, benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code is a resource module for CSS processing, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe for inclusion in a supply chain. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
