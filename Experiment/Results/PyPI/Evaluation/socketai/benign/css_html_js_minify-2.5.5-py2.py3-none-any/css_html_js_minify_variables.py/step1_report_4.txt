{
  "purpose": "The code defines CSS color constants and a large set of CSS property names for CSS processing and minification.",
  "sources": "Constants for color definitions (EXTENDED_NAMED_COLORS) and CSS property list string (CSS_PROPS_TEXT). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions; no external data handling, user input, or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares static data structures and strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of data declarations: a dictionary of color names mapped to RGB tuples and a large string of CSS property names. There are no functions, user inputs, environment variable accesses, or external interactions. The data appears static and intended for CSS processing. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code does not perform any operations or contain logic that could be exploited or that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration or resource module for CSS processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a static data declaration with no dynamic or harmful behavior.",
