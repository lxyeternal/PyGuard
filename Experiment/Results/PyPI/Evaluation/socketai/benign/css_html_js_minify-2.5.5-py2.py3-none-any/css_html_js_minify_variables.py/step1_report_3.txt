  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded color mappings and CSS property string to potential consumers of this module, but no untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code consists solely of static data definitions and a large string of CSS properties.",
