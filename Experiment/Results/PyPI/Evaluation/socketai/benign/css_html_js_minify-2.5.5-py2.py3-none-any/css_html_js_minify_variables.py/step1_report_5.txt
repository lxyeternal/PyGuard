  "purpose": "Defines color constants and CSS property text for CSS processing, minification, or related tasks.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries and string literals; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data processing or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code purely contains data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a dictionary of color names mapped to RGB tuples and a large string of CSS properties. There are no dynamic or input-dependent components. No network, file I/O, or executable code is present. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with configuration or resource data files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data module defining color constants and CSS properties for legitimate processing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
