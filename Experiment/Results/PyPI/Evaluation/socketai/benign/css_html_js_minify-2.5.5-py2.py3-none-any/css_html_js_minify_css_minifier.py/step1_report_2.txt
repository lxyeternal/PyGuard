  "purpose": "This code provides functions to minify and optimize CSS code by removing comments, whitespace, shortening colors, and sorting properties.",
  "sources": "Functions receive CSS code as input, either as strings passed directly to functions like 'css_minify' or as data read from CSS files.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that send untrusted data to external systems, network, or file writes. The functions modify CSS strings internally.",
  "flows": "Input CSS data flows through various transformation functions for minification and optimization; no external data flows or outputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. All functions perform standard CSS processing without hidden or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive CSS minification utility, employing regex-based pattern matching and string manipulations. No code injection, dynamic execution, or external network interactions are present. It uses standard Python modules (re, itertools) and processes CSS content safely. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The functions operate purely on string data, focusing on CSS formatting and optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CSS minification utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code appears safe for inclusion in projects. Confidence is high due to the straightforward and standard nature of functions.",
