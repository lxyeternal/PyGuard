{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to minify and optimize CSS code by removing comments, whitespace, and condensing colors and properties.",
  "sources": "Functions like remove_comments, remove_unnecessary_whitespace, remove_unnecessary_semicolons, remove_empty_rules, normalize_rgb_colors_to_hex, condense_* functions, and regex patterns that process CSS strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data modification points include regex replacements and string concatenations, but none are inherently unsafe or lead to data leaks. No sinks process untrusted external inputs directly or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The code reads CSS input strings, processes them through various functions (e.g., remove_comments, condense_hex_colors), and outputs optimized CSS strings. There are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, such as network calls, file access, or dynamic code execution, is present. Comment preservation for /*!...*/ and CSS property sorting are standard minification practices.",
  "analysis": "The script thoroughly implements CSS minification techniques, including comment removal, whitespace condensing, color normalization, and property sorting. All regex patterns and string manipulations are consistent with standard CSS processing. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Functions do not perform network operations, file I/O, or dynamic execution that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a CSS minifier library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It adheres to standard minification practices and does not contain malware or security risks beyond typical CSS processing functions.",
