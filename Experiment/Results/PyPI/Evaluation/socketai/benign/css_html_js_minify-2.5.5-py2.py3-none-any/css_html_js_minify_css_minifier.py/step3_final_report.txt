  "purpose": "CSS minification and optimization through string manipulation, regex parsing, and property sorting functions.",
  "sources": "Input CSS string; internal variables for color and property lists; regex patterns for parsing CSS blocks and properties.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all operations are string-based transformations without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Source CSS input -> regex parsing and string modifications -> output minified CSS string.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional addition of '@charset \"utf-8\";' in add_encoding function; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CSS minification tasks: comment removal, whitespace condensing, color normalization, property sorting, and other CSS string transformations. It uses regex and string operations exclusively, with no external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The presence of external variables for colors and properties does not introduce malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward and purpose-specific, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The only minor point is the unconditional addition of charset declaration, which is benign in the context of CSS minification. Overall, the code is a clean, standard utility for CSS optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSS minifier with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
