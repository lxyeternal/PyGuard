  "purpose": "CSS minification and optimization functions for CSS-HTML-JS-Minify.",
  "sources": "Functions and regex operations that read CSS strings, patterns, and variables for color names.",
  "sinks": "Regex replacements, string concatenations, and modifications that process CSS content, but no untrusted input sources or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings are processed through multiple transformation functions, including comment removal, whitespace normalization, color conversions, and minification steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code is solely for CSS minification.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically performs CSS minification, including comment removal, whitespace trimming, color shortening, and property sorting. All functions manipulate CSS strings through regex and string operations. There are no input sources that could be untrusted; the data is assumed to be CSS content. No network calls, credential handling, or suspicious data flows are identified. The code appears to be a standard CSS minification utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSS minification module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes CSS content purely for optimization purposes, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
