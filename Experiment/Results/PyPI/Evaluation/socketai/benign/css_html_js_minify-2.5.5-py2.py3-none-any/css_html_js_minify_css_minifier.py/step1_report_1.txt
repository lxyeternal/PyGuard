{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for CSS minification, including comment removal, whitespace condensing, color normalization, and property sorting.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS input string, particularly in functions like remove_comments, sort_properties, and css_minify.",
  "sinks": "Modifies and returns CSS strings; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "CSS input flows through various transformation functions, culminating in minification. No external data or untrusted inputs are forwarded to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly processes CSS strings for minification purposes, with functions dedicated to comment removal, whitespace condensing, color normalization, property sorting, and other CSS optimizations. It uses regex patterns for parsing and transforming CSS. No indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or network activity. All operations are strictly string manipulations related to CSS processing. The use of external variables like EXTENDED_NAMED_COLORS and CSS_PROPS_TEXT appears to be for color and property lists, not malicious data. The functions are standard for CSS minification and do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a CSS minification utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It purely manipulates CSS strings for optimization. It is safe from a security perspective based on the provided content.",
