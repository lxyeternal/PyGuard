      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate minification tool with a notable security risk stemming from executing external commands with unvalidated user input. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should reflect the potential for command injection if inputs are not sanitized. A risk score of approximately 0.6 is appropriate, considering the supply chain implications of unvalidated external command execution."

The existing security risk scores of approximately 0.1 are overly conservative; they should be adjusted to 0, reflecting the benign nature. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1)."
