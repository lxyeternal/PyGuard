  "purpose": "A module for minifying CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files to optimize web content.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a relative 'minify' module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code defines imports and exposes functions, with no data flow or processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only import statements and metadata; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface or facade, importing minification functions from a local module and exposing them for external use. It contains no logic, data processing, or external communication, minimizing security concerns. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or data leaks are present. The module appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package interface for minification functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
