{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a web minification tool for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, intended to optimize and reduce the size of web assets.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.minify', which likely contains the implementation details of the minification functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be the functions like html_minify, js_minify, css_minify if they process untrusted input, but there is no direct handling of data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow would be: external input (files or data to be minified) → calls to minify functions → output of minified code, but no data handling is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are apparent; the code is straightforward and primarily imports functions and sets version metadata.",
  "analysis": "This script serves as a module initializer or interface for a minification library. It imports specific functions for processing HTML, JS, and CSS files and defines metadata such as version and exported symbols. There are no data processing, input handling, or security-critical operations present. The code does not perform any file I/O, network communication, or data processing directly, reducing risk. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for a web asset minifier with no malicious intent. It mainly exports functions and metadata, with no evidence of security risks or malicious behavior in this snippet.",
