  "purpose": "A module for minifying CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files, intended for web optimization.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module named .minify, which likely contains processing functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports various minification functions from a local module. It defines versioning and exports symbols for use elsewhere. There are no input or output handling, no dynamic code execution, or network activities. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks detected. It functions solely to organize and expose minification functions.",
