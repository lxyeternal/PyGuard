  "purpose": "Module initializer for a web minification library, importing functions from a local 'minify' module and setting version and export symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local '.minify' module, setting __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export setup with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module (likely __init__.py) that imports functions from a local 'minify' module, sets version info, and defines exported symbols. It contains no data handling, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
