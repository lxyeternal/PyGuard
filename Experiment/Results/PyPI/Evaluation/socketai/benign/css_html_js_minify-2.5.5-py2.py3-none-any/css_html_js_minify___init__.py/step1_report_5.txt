  "purpose": "To provide a set of functions for minifying CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files, enhancing web performance.",
  "sources": "Import from a local or relative module named 'minify' ('.minify'). No external input sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code mainly imports functions and sets module attributes; no data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a module initializer, importing various minification functions from a local 'minify' module and defining module metadata. No input handling, no data processing, and no external interactions are visible. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initializer for a minification library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
