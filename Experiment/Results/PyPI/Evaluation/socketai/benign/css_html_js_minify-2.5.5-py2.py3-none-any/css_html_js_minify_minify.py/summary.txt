  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate minification tool with a notable security risk stemming from executing external commands with unvalidated user input. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should reflect the potential for command injection if inputs are not sanitized. A risk score of approximately 0.6 is appropriate, considering the supply chain implications of unvalidated external command execution."
