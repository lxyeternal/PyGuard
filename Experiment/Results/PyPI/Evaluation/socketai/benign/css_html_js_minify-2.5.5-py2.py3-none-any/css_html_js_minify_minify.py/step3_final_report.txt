  "purpose": "A minification utility for CSS, HTML, and JS files, processing local files or directories with optional features like timestamping, hashing, gzipping, and watching for changes.",
  "sources": "File reads for CSS, HTML, JS files; command-line arguments for '--after' and '--before' for executing external commands.",
  "sinks": "Writes minified files, gzipped files, and potentially executes external commands via subprocess.getoutput().",
  "flows": "Reads input files, processes/minifies content, optionally executes external commands, writes output files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.getoutput() with user-controlled arguments ('--after', '--before') without validation, which could lead to command injection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate minification tasks with straightforward file I/O. The main security concern is the execution of external commands via subprocess.getoutput() with arguments that may be supplied by users. This could allow command injection if inputs are not sanitized. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate risk score (around 0.3 to 0.6) due to potential command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate minification tool with a notable security risk stemming from executing external commands with unvalidated user input. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should reflect the potential for command injection if inputs are not sanitized. A risk score of approximately 0.6 is appropriate, considering the supply chain implications of unvalidated external command execution.",
