  "purpose": "A script for minifying CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files, supporting file processing, watching for changes, and batch processing via multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "File reads from open() calls, os.stat() for modification times, and getoutput() for executing external commands.",
  "sinks": "File writes for minified outputs, gzip compression files, and potential execution of external commands via getoutput().",
  "flows": "Sources (file reads, modification time checks) lead to minification functions; outputs are written to files; getoutput() can execute commands after processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getoutput() to run external commands specified by user input without sanitization; potential for executing arbitrary shell commands if 'after' or 'before' arguments are supplied. No input validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files for minification, which is typical; however, the use of getoutput() with user-supplied commands poses a security risk if those commands are not validated or sanitized, potentially allowing command injection. The script does not sanitize the 'after' command, so an attacker could supply malicious commands. File operations and external command execution are the primary points of concern. No embedded malicious payloads or backdoors are evident in the code; the core functions perform standard minification and file handling. The code structure appears normal, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The external command execution is the main anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file processing and minification tasks with no embedded malware or backdoors. However, it contains a security risk through the unsanitized execution of external commands via getoutput(), which could be exploited if user input is maliciously crafted. This is a potential supply chain risk if user inputs are not properly validated before being passed to the system shell.",
