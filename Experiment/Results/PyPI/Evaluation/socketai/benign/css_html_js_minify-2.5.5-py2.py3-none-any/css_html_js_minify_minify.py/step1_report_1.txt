{
  "purpose": "The script is a minification tool for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files, with options for processing individual files or entire directories, including features like watching for file changes, adding timestamps, and compressing output.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided file paths or directory paths via command-line arguments, reading files from disk using open() calls.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations where minified and processed files are saved back to disk. Also, gzip compression outputs files. No network operations or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (sources) through minification functions, optional timestamping, filename modification, and finally writing to output files or gzipped files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious variable names. It performs standard file I/O operations and subprocess calls for getoutput, which is expected for running commands. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a file minification utility. It processes files and directories, applies minification functions, optionally adds timestamps and hashes, and handles output file naming. The use of subprocess.getoutput is for executing optional commands post-processing, which is common in build tools. No network communication, system manipulation, or hidden behaviors are detected. The design is typical for CLI-based file processing tools, with no indications of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured minification utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It operates solely on local files, with standard libraries and no hidden or malicious code. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
