  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs conditional imports based on environment, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no anomalies, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the fallback import pattern and the absence of suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis correctly states that the code handles imports with fallback mechanisms, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sound evaluation.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Identifies the standard pattern of conditional imports, no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly describes the import logic, fallback handling, and lack of suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Malware concerns:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; all code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, the risk score remains at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.  \n- **Risk score:** Should stay at 0, as the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be changed.",
