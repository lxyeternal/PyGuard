{
  "purpose": "The code performs conditional imports to support either a compiled or source version of bencode encoding/decoding modules, setting a flag accordingly.",
  "sources": "The import statements from either __bencode, __decoder, or __encoder modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import from __bencode; if that fails, it imports from __decoder and __encoder; then sets COMPILED flag.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for optional compiled module support.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a try-except block to attempt importing from a compiled module, falling back to source modules if necessary. It sets a boolean flag based on success and defines __all__ for exports. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or code obfuscation. The pattern is common and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import fallback pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
