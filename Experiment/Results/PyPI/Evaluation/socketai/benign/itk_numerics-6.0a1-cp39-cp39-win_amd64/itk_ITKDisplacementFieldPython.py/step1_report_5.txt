{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily for importing various modules related to ITK (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit) and setting up SWIG wrappers for C++ classes in Python, used for medical image processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for built-in modules, system version info, and multiple ITK-related Python modules and SWIG-generated wrappers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Module imports and class decorators flow from the top-level import statements into class definitions and module initializations, with no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated by SWIG, with standard boilerplate and no unusual logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The import of multiple ITK modules is typical for a medical imaging library setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily auto-generated boilerplate for setting up SWIG wrappers for C++ classes used in ITK. It imports system modules, defines helper functions for attribute setting, and imports a series of ITK Python modules. The structure and content are consistent with standard SWIG-generated interface code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The absence of any data processing or I/O beyond module imports reduces the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate auto-generated wrapper code for ITK modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is standard setup code for a medical imaging toolkit in Python, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
