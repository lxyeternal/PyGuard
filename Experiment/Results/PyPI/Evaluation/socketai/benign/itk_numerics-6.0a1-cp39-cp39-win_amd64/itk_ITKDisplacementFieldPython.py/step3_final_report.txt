  "purpose": "Auto-generated SWIG wrapper code for ITK C++ modules, facilitating Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, attribute management functions, class decorators, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import flows, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is boilerplate generated by SWIG for Python bindings of ITK C++ classes. It includes import statements, attribute setters, class decorators, and module imports. There are no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or external data flows. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe, auto-generated Python binding layer for ITK modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its benign purpose.",
