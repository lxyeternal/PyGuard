{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated Python wrapper for C++ ITK image processing libraries, primarily used for image analysis and filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports system modules (sys, builtins), and several ITK Python extension modules (e.g., itk.ITKPyBasePython, itk.ITKTransformPython, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected; no untrusted data sinks like network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points are present",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or malicious payloads are identifiable in this static code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears to be auto-generated wrapper code with standard import statements and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script is auto-generated by SWIG for wrapping C++ ITK modules into Python. It includes import statements for various ITK-related modules and defines utility functions for attribute setting and representation. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. The code structure is typical for SWIG-generated bindings and contains no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard auto-generated wrapper for image processing libraries with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe based on static analysis; however, it does not include runtime behavior inspection.",
