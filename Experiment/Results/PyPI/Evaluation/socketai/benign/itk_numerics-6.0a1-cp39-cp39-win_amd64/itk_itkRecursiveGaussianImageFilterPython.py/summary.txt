  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated binding for ITK's Recursive Gaussian filters. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only minor security concern relates to untrusted input influencing filter parameters, which is a common and expected scenario in open-source API wrappers. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1)."
