{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated Python bindings for ITK Recursive Gaussian filters, providing access to C++ classes and methods for image processing.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters via method calls such as SetSigma, SetOrder, and constructor functions; no external untrusted data sources or network/file reads are present.",
  "sinks": "Parameters like sigma and order are set via public methods; no data leaks, network connections, or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into setter methods which configure the underlying C++ objects; no external data flows directly into the code beyond method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is boilerplate, auto-generated binding code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SWIG-generated wrapper for ITK Gaussian filter classes. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is that untrusted input passed into setter methods (e.g., SetSigma, SetOrder) could influence behavior, but this is typical for such API wrappers and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be low, reflecting standard usage and potential misuse if inputs are not validated externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated binding for ITK's Recursive Gaussian filters. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only minor security concern relates to untrusted input influencing filter parameters, which is a common and expected scenario in open-source API wrappers. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1).",
