{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python bindings for ITK image filters, specifically projection and mean projection filters, enabling their configuration and instantiation via user arguments.",
  "sources": "Arguments (*args, **kwargs) passed into functions that instantiate or clone filters, flowing into underlying C++ functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or file operations; data flows into C++ filter creation functions.",
  "flows": "User arguments flow into filter creation functions, configuring filters without handling raw untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated SWIG binding code with no secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Constructor raising errors is a standard pattern to prevent misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Python wrapper for ITK image filters, accepting user arguments to instantiate and configure filters. No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The use of *args/**kwargs is standard for flexible APIs. The code does not handle raw untrusted data directly; it merely passes arguments into underlying C++ functions. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The high confidence scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and typical for auto-generated binding layers for ITK filters. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on downstream use of user inputs, but the code itself is clean and trustworthy.",
