  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Python binding for ITK spatial objects. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The data flows are internal and controlled, with no external untrusted data sinks. The previous reports' scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk are justified and consistent with the analysis."
