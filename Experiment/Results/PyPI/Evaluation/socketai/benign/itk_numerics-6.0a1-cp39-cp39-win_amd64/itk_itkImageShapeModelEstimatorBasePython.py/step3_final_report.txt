{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated SWIG wrapper classes for C++ ITK image filter and estimator base classes, serving as Python proxies and registration functions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, casting functions, registration calls; no data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Structural class proxies and registration, no data or control flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard binding code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of auto-generated proxy classes for abstract C++ classes, with no data processing, external communication, or malicious behavior. All classes are abstract, with constructor errors on instantiation, typical for binding layers. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, infrastructural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, infrastructural binding layer for ITK classes, with no malicious intent or activity. The scores are appropriate; the code can be considered secure and non-suspicious.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
