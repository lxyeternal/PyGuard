{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated Python bindings for ITK contour extraction classes, facilitating image processing workflows via SWIG wrappers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class methods, function arguments, and internal class attributes; no external data sources or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that process data within the Python layer and invoke underlying C++ functions; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into class methods, which invoke C++ functions; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard SWIG-generated binding structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class wrappers, factory functions, and method definitions typical of SWIG-generated bindings for ITK classes. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is confined within the scope of image processing parameters, with no external data handling. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Python binding for ITK contour extraction classes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe for use in image processing workflows, presenting minimal security risk.",
