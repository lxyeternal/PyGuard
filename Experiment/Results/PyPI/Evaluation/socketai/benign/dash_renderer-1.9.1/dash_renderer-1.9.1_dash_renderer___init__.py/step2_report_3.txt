  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static configuration for dependencies; no malicious activity, no dynamic code execution, no input flows. URLs are standard CDN links.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code is purely declarative, referencing well-known CDN URLs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious content. The use of __file__ is benign. The scoring seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; static dependency definitions, no dynamic code, no untrusted input, URLs from reputable sources. __file__ is unused but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is solid. The small securityRisk score (0.1) accounts for potential external dependency issues, but no actual malicious activity is evident. The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static dependency listing, no dynamic code, no user input, URLs from CDN. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent and accurate. The code is standard dependency configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; static dependency definitions, CDN links, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is correct. The slight securityRisk score is appropriate given the external dependencies, but no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static dependency references, no dynamic execution, no untrusted input, URLs from CDN, safe use of __name__.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code only contains static data definitions and references to known CDN URLs. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable. The code itself does not perform any risky operations; the only concern might be external dependencies, but these are standard CDN links.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the static and benign nature of the code.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.05** — very low; mainly dependency trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign static configuration for JavaScript dependencies, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context in which such dependency lists are used. If these URLs were compromised or if the dependencies were tampered with, risks could arise, but based solely on this static code snippet, the security posture appears sound.",
