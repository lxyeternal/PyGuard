{
  "purpose": "The code defines external dependencies and resource paths for JavaScript assets used in a Python package, likely related to a web framework or dashboard rendering.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or user data; it only defines static data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or involve data leakage or code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely declares static resource URLs and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. All URLs are from reputable CDN sources (unpkg.com).",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static lists and dictionaries specifying URLs and local paths for JavaScript dependencies, with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network communication logic. No signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior are observed. The URLs point to well-known CDN resources, and the structure appears standard for asset management. No potential vulnerabilities or malicious intents are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of static dependencies for a Python package, with no malicious or security-risk indicators. It appears to be legitimate resource configuration code.",
