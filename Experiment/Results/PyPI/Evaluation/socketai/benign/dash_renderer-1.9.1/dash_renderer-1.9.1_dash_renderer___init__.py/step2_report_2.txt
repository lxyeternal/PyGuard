  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is static, defines dependency URLs, no dynamic or user input involved, no network activity, URLs are standard CDN links, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign configuration data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Overall justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the use of __file__ (unused), static data, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The use of __file__ is benign here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The small securityRisk is justified due to the presence of external URLs, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Static dependency definitions, CDN URLs, no dynamic code or input, standard structure.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Static dependency lists, CDN links, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, justified due to external URLs.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar static configuration, no dynamic code, safe URLs, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, static nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by reliance on external CDN URLs, which are standard for dependency management.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for external URL reliance, but no actual risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is straightforward dependency configuration with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- The references to __file__ are benign and unused.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment aligns with the reports. The code is safe, with negligible security risk primarily due to external dependencies, which is common in such configurations.",
