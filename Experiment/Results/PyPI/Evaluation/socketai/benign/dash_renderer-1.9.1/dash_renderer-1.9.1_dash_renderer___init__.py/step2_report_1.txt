  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is static configuration, no dynamic or malicious behavior, URLs are standard CDN links.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code indeed only defines static data structures with no execution, input, or network activity.\n  - The URLs are from reputable CDNs hosting well-known libraries.\n  - The use of `__file__` is benign and unused.\n- **Verdict**: The report's conclusions and scores are accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, defines dependencies with static data; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The slight securityRisk score (0.1) might be justified due to the presence of external URLs, but since these are standard CDN links, the risk is minimal.\n  - No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Verdict**: The low securityRisk score is reasonable. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Static dependency declaration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Assessment**:\n  - Consistent with previous reports; no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n  - URLs are from reputable sources.\n- **Verdict**: Correct and reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Static dependency list, potential concern about external URLs but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n- **Assessment**:\n  - External CDN links could be a vector if compromised, but as-is, they are standard.\n  - No dynamic code or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict**: The slight securityRisk score is appropriate; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar static configuration, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Assessment**:\n  - All dependency URLs are from reputable sources.\n  - No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict**: Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Thoughts\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, scoring 0.\n- **Obfuscated**: All are 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Scores**:\n  - Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the fact that external URLs can be a minor risk but are standard CDN links.\n  - The small securityRisk of 0.1 in some reports is reasonable given the external dependencies, but no active threat exists.\n\n### Overall Estimate\n\nGiven the static nature of the code, the reputable CDN sources, and the absence of dynamic or malicious behavior, **the scores across all reports are appropriate**.\n\n**My final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.05–0.1 (minimal risk due to external dependencies, but generally safe)\n\n**Note**: No evidence suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities. The code is standard dependency configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent and accurate. The low risk scores are justified, and there are no discrepancies or overlooked issues.",
