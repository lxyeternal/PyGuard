  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic, code, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Declares dependency URLs and paths; no dynamic code, no user input, no network operations.\n- **Findings:** The code is static, referencing CDN URLs for well-known libraries. The `__file__` attribute is unused but harmless.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0.\n- **Risk:** No security risk; configuration code with no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** The report's scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defining dependencies with static URLs and paths; no dynamic code.\n- **Findings:** URLs are from reputable sources, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Risk:** Very low; no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Static dependency declarations; no dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; CDN URLs are standard.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** 0 scores are justified.\n- **Risk:** No security issues.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Dependency references with URLs and paths; no dynamic code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static dependency configuration.\n- **Findings:** External URLs are from CDN, no obfuscation, no user input.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** 0 scores are appropriate.\n- **Risk:** No security concern.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), justified given the static, dependency listing nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication beyond referencing external URLs, or handle untrusted input.\n- The URLs are from reputable CDNs hosting well-known libraries.\n- The `__file__` attribute is unused, which is benign.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- Since no malicious or obfuscated activity is present, I would assign the following estimated scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal potential for external resource dependency issues, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign static configuration for dependencies with no security risks or malicious behavior. The existing report scores are justified and should stand as they are.",
