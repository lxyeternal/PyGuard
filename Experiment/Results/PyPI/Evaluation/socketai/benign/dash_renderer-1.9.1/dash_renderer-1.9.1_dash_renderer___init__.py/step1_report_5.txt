{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define dependencies and URLs for JavaScript assets used in a web application, likely for a dashboard or renderer component.",
  "sources": "The code reads from static lists and dictionaries containing URLs and file paths, and references the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections or data output are evident; the URLs are used as external resource links.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static URL strings and file path definitions; no dynamic or untrusted input flows into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The URLs are standard CDN links, and no dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines data structures (lists and dictionaries) that specify external JavaScript dependencies and their locations, including CDN links and local paths. There is no user input processing, no network communication code, nor any code execution based on untrusted data. The references to external URLs are benign CDN links for known libraries. The use of __name__ to generate filenames appears safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration for JavaScript dependencies, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues detected. It solely references external and local resource paths for asset management.",
