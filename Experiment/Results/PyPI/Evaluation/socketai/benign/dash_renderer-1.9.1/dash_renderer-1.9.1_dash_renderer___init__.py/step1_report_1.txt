{
  "purpose": "Define external JavaScript dependencies and package paths for a Python project related to dash_renderer.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__), hardcoded URLs, and static strings defining dependencies and paths.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted input or data sinks; no network communication or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment from constants and module attributes; no dynamic or user input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __file__ without any subsequent operation; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; URLs appear standard for CDN resources.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines data structures for dependency URLs and package paths. No code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The URLs point to well-known CDNs hosting JavaScript libraries, and no suspicious or malicious content is evident. The __file__ attribute is referenced but not used further, which is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a configuration or resource listing for front-end assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of dependency URLs and paths with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a static configuration for dependencies and does not contain any security risks.",
