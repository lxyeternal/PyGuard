  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is purely static configuration: lists and dictionaries defining external URLs and local paths.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity is present.\n- URLs point to well-known CDN sources (unpkg.com), hosting standard JavaScript libraries.\n- The __file__ attribute is referenced but not used; this is benign.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Claims:** No malicious behavior; static configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Claims:** Similar to Report 1; defines dependencies with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Notes:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to the external URLs, but these are from reputable CDNs.\n- **Verdict:** The low securityRisk score seems reasonable given the static, well-known URLs. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Claims:** Same as above; static dependency declarations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Claims:** Dependency configuration with external URLs and local paths.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Notes:** Slight concern about external URLs, but they are from reputable sources.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Claims:** Similar static dependency listing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. All URLs are standard CDN links for common libraries.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mostly a static configuration referencing trusted sources.\n- **Code behavior:** No dynamic execution, input handling, or network communication beyond referencing URLs.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, trusted nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The slight securityRisk scores of 0.1 in some reports are reasonable but do not indicate actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, serving as a static dependency configuration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
