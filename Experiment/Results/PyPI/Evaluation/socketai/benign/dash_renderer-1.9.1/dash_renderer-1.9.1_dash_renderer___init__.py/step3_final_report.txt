  "purpose": "Static configuration of external JavaScript dependencies for a Python project, defining CDN URLs and local paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input; defines static data structures with URLs and paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static data is used solely for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The __file__ variable is referenced but not used; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining dependency URLs and paths with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. URLs are from reputable CDNs hosting standard libraries. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The __file__ attribute is unused and benign. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. External URLs pose minimal risk given their reputable sources. Overall, the code is a safe, standard dependency configuration with negligible security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration data with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores across all reports are accurate and justified based on the static, reputable nature of the dependencies. No modifications are necessary.",
