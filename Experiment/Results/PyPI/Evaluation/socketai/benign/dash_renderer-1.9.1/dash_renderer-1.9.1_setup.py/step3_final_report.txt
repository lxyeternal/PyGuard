  "purpose": "Load package version information from 'package.json' and pass it to setuptools.setup() for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reading 'package.json' file to extract version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is used internally for package setup.",
  "flows": "File read from 'package.json' to variable 'package', then version used in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of 'package.json' instead of standard Python packaging files; no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads 'package.json' to obtain version info and uses it in the setup() function. It does not perform any code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of an external JSON file for versioning is unusual but benign. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code, with a minor concern about external JSON integrity but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script that loads version info from an external JSON file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
