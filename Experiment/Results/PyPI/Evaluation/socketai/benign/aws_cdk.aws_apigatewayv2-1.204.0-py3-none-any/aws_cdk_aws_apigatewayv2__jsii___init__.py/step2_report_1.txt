  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard AWS CDK setup script: importing libraries, loading a JSII assembly, and publishing.\n- No report indicates any dynamic data processing, untrusted input handling, or network activity.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for infrastructure as code modules.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n- The code matches the descriptions: import statements, assembly load, and publish call.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reasoning in each report is accurate: the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), justified by the code's nature as infrastructure setup, not executing untrusted data.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is justified given the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports uniformly rate the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior, which is consistent with the code provided.\n- No adjustments are necessary for the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the code's purpose and static nature.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the analysis:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard AWS CDK module setup with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Continue monitoring for any dynamic behaviors in related code, but this snippet is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such.",
