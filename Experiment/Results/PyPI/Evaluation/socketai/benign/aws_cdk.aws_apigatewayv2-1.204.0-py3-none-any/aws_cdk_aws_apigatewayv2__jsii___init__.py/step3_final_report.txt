{
  "purpose": "This code loads an AWS CDK JSII assembly for @aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2 and publishes the module, serving as part of infrastructure setup.",
  "sources": "The assembly load via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() and the publication.publish() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static module loading and publishing only.",
  "flows": "Assembly is loaded, then published; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library imports and assembly loading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script for AWS CDK, importing necessary modules, loading a specific JSII assembly, and publishing it. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The assembly load is a common pattern in CDK modules, and the publish call registers the module. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the assembly load but standard in CDK workflows. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS CDK module setup with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
