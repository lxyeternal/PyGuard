  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'cymem' Python library, including title, version, summary, URI, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments providing package metadata; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code solely consists of variable assignments for package information. No obfuscated code, hidden functions, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static package metadata without any dynamic or executable content. It does not read external input, handle sensitive data, or execute code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is typical for Python package setup or metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata declaration for the package 'cymem' with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It is standard boilerplate code used in Python packaging.",
