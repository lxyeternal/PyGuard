  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'cymem' library, including version, description, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables such as __title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that handle untrusted input or output",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths observed in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets; code consists solely of metadata variable definitions",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of string assignments that define metadata attributes for the package. There are no functions, data handling, or executable code that could introduce security risks. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident. This appears to be a standard module initialization or metadata declaration block.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only package metadata and presents no security threat or malicious intent. It is a standard declaration of package information with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious elements.",
