  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow or external interaction",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static metadata with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative metadata with no functions, executable logic, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The source URL and author details are standard for open-source packages and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
