{
  "purpose": "Metadata definition for the cymem Python package, describing its name, version, summary, URL, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only metadata variables are defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, input, or output occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward metadata assignment with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata such as title, version, summary, URL, author, email, and license. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external data sources, and no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern could be the source URL or author details, but these are typical for package metadata and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata for the cymem package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python package setup files.",
