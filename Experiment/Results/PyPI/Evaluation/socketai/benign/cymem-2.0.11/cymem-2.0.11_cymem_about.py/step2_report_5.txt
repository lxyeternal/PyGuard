  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata (`__title__`, `__version__`, `__summary__`, `__uri__`, `__author__`, `__email__`, `__license__`).\n   - There are no functions, no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing.\n   - The code is typical for Python package setup or metadata declaration.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious constructs, hidden functions, or obfuscated code.\n   - No external system interactions, network calls, or data handling that could pose security risks.\n   - The URLs and author details are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Correct, the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — Correct, no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — Appropriate, as there's no security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The only possible concern could be the source URL or author details, but these are standard and do not suggest malicious activity.\n   - Since all reports confirm the code is just metadata, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is benign, standard package metadata, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
