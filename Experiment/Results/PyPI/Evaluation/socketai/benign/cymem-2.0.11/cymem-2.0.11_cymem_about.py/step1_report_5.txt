  "purpose": "Metadata definition for the 'cymem' Python package, describing its name, version, summary, URL, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only static metadata variables are defined.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially harmful data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as the code only assigns metadata strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present in this metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets string variables containing package metadata such as title, version, summary, URL, author, email, and license. It does not execute any logic, read external input, or perform any operations beyond static assignments. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard metadata declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and typical for Python package setup files.",
