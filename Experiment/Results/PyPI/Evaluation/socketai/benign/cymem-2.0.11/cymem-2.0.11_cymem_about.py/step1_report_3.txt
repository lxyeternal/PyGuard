{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'cymem' Python package, including version, description, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Static metadata assignments (e.g., __title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__). No input reading present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks, as this is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments that set package metadata. There are no functions, no external calls, no data processing, and no code execution mechanisms. Given the absence of executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The metadata appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static metadata declarations for the package 'cymem' with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign fragment serving informational purposes.",
