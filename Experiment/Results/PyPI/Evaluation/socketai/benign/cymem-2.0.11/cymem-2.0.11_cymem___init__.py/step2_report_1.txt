  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a simple import statement.\n- No data flow, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms a standard relative import.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), noting the minimal nature.\n- No malware or security risk.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (a small risk due to minimal concern about the import pattern), confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minor security risk score is justified given the import pattern's potential stylistic issues, not maliciousness.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights the use of wildcard import ('*') as a stylistic concern.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.8).\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Wildcard import can cause namespace pollution but is not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, standard import pattern.\n- Notes namespace pollution concern but no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, confirms standard import.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward import statement.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor security risk scores (0.1) are justified due to the use of wildcard imports and the general caution around namespace pollution, not actual malicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the minimal, benign nature of the code, a risk score of 0.1 seems acceptable but perhaps slightly conservative. Since the import pattern itself is not inherently risky, I would suggest a risk score of **0** for all reports, unless there are contextual concerns not present here.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or risky behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code snippet itself is benign and standard in Python packages.",
