  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'about' module in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from the 'about' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink identified; import statement itself does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements are static and do not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .about import *' can be considered a bad practice, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, importing all definitions from the 'about' module within the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The use of wildcard import can be a maintenance concern but is not inherently malicious. No external data sources, environment variables, or network activity are involved. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard relative import with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not include any obfuscated or malicious code components.",
