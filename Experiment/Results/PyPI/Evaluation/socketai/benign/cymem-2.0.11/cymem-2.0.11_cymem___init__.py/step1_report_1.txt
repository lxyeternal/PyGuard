  "anomalies": "Single line import statement; no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing everything from the 'about' module. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no suspicious operations. This pattern is common in package __init__.py files or modular code structures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
