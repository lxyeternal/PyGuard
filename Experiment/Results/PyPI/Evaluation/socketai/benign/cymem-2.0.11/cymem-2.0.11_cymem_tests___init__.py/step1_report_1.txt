{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or computation, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; there are no obvious data reading functions, network calls, or environment variable accesses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks such as file writes, network transmissions, or sensitive data handling are not evident in the code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows are present; the code mainly performs internal calculations or operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows standard programming constructs with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, and no operations that seem intended for data exfiltration or system compromise. The code does not include dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities. Based on the available content, it appears to be a benign implementation without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Python script with no detected malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations, nor does it contain vulnerabilities or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
