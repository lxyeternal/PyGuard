  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or sinks identified; code is either absent or minimal, with potential external interactions implied but not confirmed.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows to network, files, or environment variables, but no concrete evidence of untrusted data handling or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Likely source-to-sink paths involve input data to processing functions and potential external communication, but no explicit flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious API calls detected; code appears straightforward or absent.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security issues. Scores are consistent with the lack of evidence: malware=0, obfuscated=0. Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting limited context but no concrete threats. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and very low where code is absent. The assessments are cautious and justified based on the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation suggests the dependency is benign with minimal security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
