  "purpose": "Minimal test code for creating instances of cymem's Pool and Address classes.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of Pool() and Address(1, 2).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Object creation from known classes without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from cymem, creates objects, and performs simple assertions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The library used is a known NLP memory management library, not associated with malicious activity. Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a simple test script with no malicious intent. The scoring remains at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
