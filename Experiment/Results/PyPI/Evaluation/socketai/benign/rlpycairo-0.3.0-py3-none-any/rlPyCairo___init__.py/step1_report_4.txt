  "purpose": "The code provides a package description, version, and imports modules related to graphics rendering and image processing, specifically using pycairo, gstate, and pil2pict.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data directly; it only defines metadata and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or system effects are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The comments and structure are standard for a Python package init file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization script. It specifies version info, exports specific symbols, and imports modules gstate and pil2pict. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. No external data handling or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Python package initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It solely sets up the module's public interface and metadata.",
