  "purpose": "Provide bitmap rendering capabilities using pycairo, including gstate and pil2pict functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (. gstate and . pil2pict). No external input sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code appears straightforward with standard module imports and definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports two modules (. gstate and . pil2pict) from the local package. There are no suspicious patterns, code injections, or obfuscated elements. The purpose is clearly documented, and the code structure is simple and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization fragment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely sets up module exports and imports local components.",
