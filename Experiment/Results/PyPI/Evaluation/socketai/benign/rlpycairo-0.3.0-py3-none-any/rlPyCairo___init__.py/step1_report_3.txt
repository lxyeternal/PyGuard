  "purpose": "Define a Python package that facilitates bitmap rendering using pycairo, exposing certain classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (. gstate and . pil2pict)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing present",
  "flows": "Imports source code from local modules, but no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs is evident",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level documentation, versioning, and explicit import statements. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. The imported modules might contain additional functionality, but this snippet alone appears benign. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple package initializer, exporting selected classes and functions. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns are detected in this fragment.",
