No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The only caveat is the external URL fetching capability, which should be used carefully in untrusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential external URL fetch risks but no active malicious behavior."

It performs expected validation tasks, including reference resolution, with standard libraries and practices. The minimal risk associated with external resource fetching is typical for such tools and does not indicate malicious activity."
