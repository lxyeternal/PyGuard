  "purpose": "This code defines an interface for importing specific components from the 'swagger_spec_validator' library, likely to be used for validation of Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'swagger_spec_validator.common' and 'swagger_spec_validator.util' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code only imports and exposes certain objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a third-party library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input reading, data processing, or execution behaviors. The code structure is minimal and standard for module interfaces. It does not perform any operations that could lead to security risks or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and export setup for a module, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be safe.",
