  "purpose": "Module that re-exports specific components from the swagger_spec_validator library for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from swagger_spec_validator.common and swagger_spec_validator.util",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Imports directly from third-party modules; no data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a re-export module. It does not process data, execute logic, or handle untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, minimal module for re-exporting components from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The current assessment scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
