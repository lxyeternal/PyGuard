  "purpose": "Re-exports specific classes and functions from the swagger_spec_validator library for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from external library modules: swagger_spec_validator.common and swagger_spec_validator.util.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no processing or data handling beyond imports and module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows within the code; just import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from a known validation library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no data processing, user input, or untrusted data handling. The code is straightforward and typical for a module that re-exports functionality. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple module to re-export selected components from a dependency without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
