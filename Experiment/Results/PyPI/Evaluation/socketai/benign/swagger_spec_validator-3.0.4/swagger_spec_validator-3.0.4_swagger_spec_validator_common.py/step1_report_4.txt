  "sources": "os.path.abspath, pathname2url, urlopen, importlib_resources.files, sys.exc_info()",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data; it mainly reads files and URLs",
  "flows": "File path and URL inputs are processed and read; no untrusted data is passed to dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of exception wrapping is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for reading local files, URLs, and resources, with appropriate exception handling and caching. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious activity are present. The URL handling and resource reading are implemented securely. The exception wrapper correctly re-raises exceptions with additional context. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility module for handling file and URL reading, with standard exception handling and caching. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
