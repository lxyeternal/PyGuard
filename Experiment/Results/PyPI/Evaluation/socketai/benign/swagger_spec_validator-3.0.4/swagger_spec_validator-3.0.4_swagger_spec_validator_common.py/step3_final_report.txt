  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading YAML/JSON files, URLs, and package resources with exception handling and caching.",
  "sources": "File system paths, URLs, package resource references",
  "sinks": "yaml.load with SafeLoader, urlopen for URL data",
  "flows": "Reading files or URLs, decoding content, passing to yaml.load with SafeLoader",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; safe YAML loader usage",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe practices for YAML parsing by using SafeLoader, mitigating YAML injection risks. Exception handling is properly wrapped, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code is present. The functions are straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior. External data parsing is controlled via safe loaders, minimizing security concerns. No backdoors or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for reading configuration data, with appropriate security measures. All signals indicate low risk and no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
