  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the security assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code provides utility functions: reading files, URLs, and resources, with exception handling and caching.\n- Uses `yaml.load` with `SafeLoader`, which is considered safe against YAML-based exploits.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- Exception wrapper correctly raises custom validation errors.\n- No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Assessment:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for reading and processing YAML/JSON files and URLs.\n- **Sources:** Files, URLs, resources.\n- **Sinks:** External data parsing with `yaml.load`.\n- **Analysis:** Uses `SafeLoader`, mitigates YAML risks. No malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security concern, minimal risk.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given external data parsing, but safe loader minimizes risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions with safe practices.\n- Uses `yaml.load` with safe loader, no malicious code.\n- No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Assessment:**\n- Utility functions for reading YAML/JSON from files, URLs, resources.\n- No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- Uses safe YAML loader, no suspicious network activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar utility functions, with standard exception handling.\n- No malicious behavior or suspicious activity.\n- Safe URL and resource handling.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar functions, with a note about `yaml.load` potentially being risky.\n- **However**, the code uses `SafeLoader`, which mitigates YAML risks.\n- No suspicious network activity or malicious code.\n\n**Concern:**\n- The report points out that `yaml.load` can be risky if used improperly, but in this code, `SafeLoader` is used, which is secure.\n- The overall conclusion is that the code is benign, with minimal security risk.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (possibly slightly high, but acceptable considering external data parsing)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but generally low, around 0.1-0.2, which is appropriate given the external data handling but safe YAML parsing.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to external data parsing, mitigated by safe loader)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and reasonable. The code is a standard utility module with safe practices in place. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed. The assessments are appropriate and well justified based on the code.",
