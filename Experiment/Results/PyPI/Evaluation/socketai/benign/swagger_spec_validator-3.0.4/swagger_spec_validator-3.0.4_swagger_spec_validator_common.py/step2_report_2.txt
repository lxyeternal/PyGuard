  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for reading YAML/JSON files, URLs, and package resources.\n- Exception handling is wrapped via `wrap_exception`.\n- YAML loading uses `SafeLoader` or `CSafeLoader` when available, which is appropriate for mitigating YAML deserialization risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution observed.\n- No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration evident.\n- Use of caching (`lru_cache`) for resource files improves efficiency but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- **YAML loading with `yaml.load(fh.read().decode(\"utf-8\"), Loader=SafeLoader)`**: This is safe assuming `SafeLoader` is used, which the code correctly implements.\n- **External data parsing**: Reading from URLs and files is inherently risky if the data is malicious, but the code uses `SafeLoader`, which minimizes YAML-specific risks.\n- **No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation**.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary**: Utility functions, safe exception handling, minimal security concerns.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — appropriate, given the safe YAML loading.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n- **Assessment**: Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary**: Similar utility functions, safe practices, low security risk.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n- **Assessment**: Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary**: Utility functions, safe practices, minimal risk.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n- **Assessment**: Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary**: Utility functions, safe exception handling, low risk.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n- **Assessment**: Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary**: Utility functions, potential YAML risk due to untrusted data, but uses `SafeLoader`.\n- **Key concern**: The report notes that `yaml.load` is used with a loader, which mitigates risk. It correctly points out that if the loader was unsafe, it could be dangerous, but here it is safe.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — seems appropriate.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores and Claims:\n\n- All reports agree on low security risk and no malware.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `yaml.load`, but the code correctly uses `SafeLoader`, mitigating YAML deserialization risks.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- The exception wrapper correctly re-raises errors with context, which is good practice.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n\n- **Risk scores**: Given the code's nature—utility functions with safe YAML parsing, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution—the assigned scores (mostly 0.1-0.2) are justified.\n- **Malware scores**: Zero across all reports is appropriate; no malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score**: 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0.1-0.2 — minimal, primarily due to external data parsing, which is mitigated by safe loaders.\n\n**Estimated scores**:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | ------------ | ---- |\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented utility module for reading YAML/JSON files and URLs, with appropriate security measures (use of SafeLoader, exception handling). No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The assigned scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a low-security, benign utility codebase.",
