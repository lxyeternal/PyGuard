  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading and parsing YAML/JSON files, handling URLs, and exception wrapping in a Swagger validation context.",
  "sources": "File system via get_uri_from_file_path, URL via read_url, resource files via importlib_resources, environment variables indirectly through os.path.abspath.",
  "sinks": "Reading files (read_file), fetching URLs (read_url), loading YAML/JSON content, raising exceptions, and caching resources.",
  "flows": "File path is converted to URL (get_uri_from_file_path) -> URL is fetched (read_url) -> YAML/JSON loaded -> data returned. Resources are accessed via importlib_resources and then read.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; use of importlib_resources and yaml.load with a safe loader reduces risk. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for file and URL reading, with exception handling and caching mechanisms. It uses safe YAML loading (CSafeLoader or SafeLoader). The importlib_resources is used to access internal package resources. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are evident. The exception wrapper raises custom validation errors. No suspicious anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for reading and parsing YAML/JSON files and resources with safe practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. Overall security risk is low.",
