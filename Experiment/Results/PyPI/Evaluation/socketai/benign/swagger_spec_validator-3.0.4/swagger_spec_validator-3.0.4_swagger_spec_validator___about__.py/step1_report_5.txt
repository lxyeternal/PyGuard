  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'swagger-spec-validator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants assignments that assign metadata values to variables (__title__, __summary__, __uri__, __version__, __author__, __email__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data, as the code only assigns static string values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static assignments are used exclusively.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments with no dynamic or malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of metadata variables related to the package. These are statically assigned string values representing the package's title, summary, URI, version, author, email, and license. There are no input reads, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources. The code appears to be a standard package metadata declaration without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It contains only static assignments of package information.",
