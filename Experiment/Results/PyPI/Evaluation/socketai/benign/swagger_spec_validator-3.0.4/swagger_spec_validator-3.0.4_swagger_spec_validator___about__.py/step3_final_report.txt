  "purpose": "Define package metadata variables with static string values for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static assignments to variables (__title__, __summary__, __uri__, __version__, __author__, __email__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as all data is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no inputs, dynamic code, external data reads, or network interactions. The code is a typical, benign package info module. All reports correctly identify this as a non-malicious, straightforward metadata declaration. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
