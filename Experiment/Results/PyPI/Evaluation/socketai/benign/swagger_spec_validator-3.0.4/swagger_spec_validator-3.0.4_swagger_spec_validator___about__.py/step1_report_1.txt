  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'swagger-spec-validator' Python package, including title, summary, URL, version, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "The code itself sets variables with static string values, with no input reading or data input operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, as no untrusted input or dynamic execution is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code strictly defines package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a list of variable definitions assigning static strings related to package metadata. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no external data reading, and no suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard metadata declaration block with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign metadata declaration for a Python package. It contains no malware or security risks. It is typical for Python packages to define such metadata, and there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
