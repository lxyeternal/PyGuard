  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The metadata appears typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains definitions of package metadata variables with static string values. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure is straightforward, standard for Python modules defining package info. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are observed.",
