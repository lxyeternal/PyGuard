  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'swagger-spec-validator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of metadata variables, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; purely static metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets module-level metadata variables such as title, summary, URL, version, author, email, and license. These are standard package metadata assignments with no external data reading, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors, and no potential malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata definition for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
