  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Swagger validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is fetching untrusted URLs, which is inherent to such tools but does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk associated with external data fetching."
