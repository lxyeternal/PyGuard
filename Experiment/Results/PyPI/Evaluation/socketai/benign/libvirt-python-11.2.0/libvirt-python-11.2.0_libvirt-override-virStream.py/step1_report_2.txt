{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class interface for managing data streams in libvirt virtualization environment, including sending, receiving, and handling stream data with support for sparse files and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Code reads input via handler functions passed to recvAll, sendAll, sparseRecvAll, sparseSendAll; also reads internal attributes such as self._o and self.cb.",
  "sinks": "Data is written via handler functions during recvAll, sendAll, sparseRecvAll, sparseSendAll; also possible through self.send and libvirtlibvirtd functions.",
  "flows": "Sources include handler functions and internal attributes; flows lead to libvirtlibvirtd functions (virStreamRecv, virStreamSend, virStreamRecvHole, virStreamSendHole, virStreamRecvFlags); potential data leakage or control flow depends on handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of exception handling around resource cleanup is standard. No code injection, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard stream handling with proper error checking and resource cleanup. Handlers are user-defined, so untrusted data flow depends on external functions, not the code itself. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of libvirt functions appears correct. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of libvirt stream management with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It operates as an interface for streaming data with user-defined callbacks, without any embedded malicious logic.",
