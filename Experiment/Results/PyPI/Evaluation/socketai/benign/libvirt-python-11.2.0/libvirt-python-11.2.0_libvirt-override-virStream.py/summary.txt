  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a libvirt stream management class. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the inherent trust in callback functions, which is typical for such APIs. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in virtualization management contexts."
