  "purpose": "An asyncio-based libvirt event loop adapter managing callbacks, descriptors, and timers to integrate libvirt's event system with asyncio.",
  "sources": "libvirt callbacks, file descriptors, timers, and user-defined callback functions.",
  "sinks": "User callbacks invoked with event data, libvirt's virEventInvokeFreeCallback to free opaque data.",
  "flows": "libvirt invokes callbacks with identifiers and opaque data; callbacks may trigger timers or descriptor events; virEventInvokeFreeCallback frees resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Standard use of libvirt API and asyncio features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an asyncio event loop for libvirt, managing descriptors, timers, and callbacks. It relies on libvirt's API for resource cleanup and event registration. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The potential security concern is that user-supplied callbacks could be malicious if provided externally, which is inherent in callback systems, not a flaw in this implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured asyncio adapter for libvirt's event system. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The inherent risk from external callbacks is standard and not indicative of malicious intent.",
