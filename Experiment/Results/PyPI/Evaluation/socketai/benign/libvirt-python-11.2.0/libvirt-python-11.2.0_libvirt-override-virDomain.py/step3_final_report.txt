  "purpose": "Wrapper functions around libvirt API calls for VM snapshot/checkpoint listing, domain creation with files, filesystem freeze/thaw, guest time management, and FD association.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as flags, file descriptors, mountpoints, domain names, and time values used as inputs to libvirt API functions.",
  "sinks": "Libvirt API functions that perform VM management tasks; potential data leaks or system effects depend on external inputs but are standard for VM control.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into libvirt functions; outputs are data structures, domain states, or exceptions; no untrusted data flows into insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; functions are straightforward wrappers with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of legitimate, standard libvirt API wrappers for VM management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. Error handling is appropriate. The use of file descriptors and domain operations is typical and controlled. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and potential misuse risks, which are minimal and typical for such system management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe set of libvirt API wrappers with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scoring accurately reflects the low inherent risk and absence of malicious intent.",
