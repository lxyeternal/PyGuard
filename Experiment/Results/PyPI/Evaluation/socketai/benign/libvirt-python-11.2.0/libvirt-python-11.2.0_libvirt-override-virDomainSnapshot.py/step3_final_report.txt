  "purpose": "Provides methods to retrieve libvirt connection, domain, and list child snapshots for a VM.",
  "sources": "self.connect(), self.domain(), libvirtmod.virDomainSnapshotListAllChildren()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "getConnect() -> self.connect(), getDomain() -> self.domain(), listAllChildren() -> libvirt API call -> wrapping into virDomainSnapshot objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around libvirt API functions for VM snapshot management. It performs standard retrieval operations with proper exception handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is evident. The functions do not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware score should remain at 0. Overall, the code is safe and the reports are accurate.",
