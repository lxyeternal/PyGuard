  "purpose": "The code provides methods to interact with domain snapshots in a virtualization environment, allowing retrieval of connections, domains, and listing child snapshots.",
  "sources": "self.connect(), self.domain(), libvirtmod.virDomainSnapshotListAllChildren(self._o, flags)",
  "sinks": "return statements, list comprehension that creates virDomainSnapshot objects",
  "flows": "Input methods (self.connect(), self.domain(), self._o) feed data into libvirt API calls, which then return data used to generate objects or results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code mainly delegates to external library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard API calls from the libvirt library to manage VM snapshots. No user input is directly processed; the methods invoke library functions that interact with virtualization components. The list method checks for failure and raises an exception if needed, which is standard practice. No unusual or obfuscated logic is present. No data leakage or malicious behaviors detected. All code appears to be straightforward wrapper functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper around libvirt snapshot functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security risks.",
