  "purpose": "Provide methods to access and list virtual machine domain snapshots and their parent connection.",
  "sources": "Method calls to self.connect(), self.domain(), and libvirtmod.virDomainSnapshotListAllChildren(), which fetch data related to VM domains and snapshots.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that provide access to domain, connection, and snapshot objects; potential for misuse if these objects are used maliciously downstream, but no direct data leaks or security issues are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Methods invoke internal functions to retrieve domain or connection objects; listAllChildren calls an external libvirt function to list snapshots and wraps the result into objects for further use. Data flows from external libvirt API calls to returned objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be straightforward wrapper functions around libvirt API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three methods: getConnect(), getDomain(), and listAllChildren(). getConnect() calls self.connect() to retrieve a connection object; getDomain() calls self.domain() to retrieve a domain object; listAllChildren() uses libvirt API to list snapshot children and wraps them into snapshot objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All external API calls are standard libvirt functions for managing VM snapshots. The exception handling in listAllChildren() is appropriate. The code structure and function usage are typical for virtualization management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for managing VM snapshots with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes functions to retrieve domain/connection objects and list snapshot children without performing any unsafe operations or data handling beyond standard API usage.",
