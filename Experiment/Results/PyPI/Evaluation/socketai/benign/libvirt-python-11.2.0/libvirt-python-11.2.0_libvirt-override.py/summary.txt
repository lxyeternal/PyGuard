  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard libvirt Python binding with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects the inherent risk in callback execution with untrusted data, which is typical for such APIs. Overall, the code is safe and does not contain malicious behavior."
