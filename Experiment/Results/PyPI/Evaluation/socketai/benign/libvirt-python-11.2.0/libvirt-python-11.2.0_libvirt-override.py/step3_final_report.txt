  "purpose": "Python bindings for libvirt, managing errors, connections, and event callbacks.",
  "sources": "Error retrieval functions, callback registration functions, user-defined callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions executing user-provided code, error message strings.",
  "flows": "Error info retrieved from libvirt -> stored in exception -> possibly displayed or logged; user callbacks invoked during events or timers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper around libvirt's C library, providing error handling, connection management, and event callback registration. It delegates core operations to libvirt's C functions via libvirtmod, with standard callback mechanisms that execute user-supplied functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The main security consideration is the execution of user-defined callbacks, which could be malicious if callbacks are untrusted, but this is inherent to event-driven systems and not indicative of malicious intent in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard libvirt Python binding with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects the inherent risk in callback execution with untrusted data, which is typical for such APIs. Overall, the code is safe and does not contain malicious behavior.",
