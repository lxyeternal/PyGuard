  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of libvirt event management. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The main risk is the execution of untrusted callbacks, which is a known and accepted pattern in such systems. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."
