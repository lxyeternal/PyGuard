  "purpose": "Manages libvirt event callbacks, registration, deregistration, and resource listing, facilitating event-driven interactions with libvirt entities.",
  "sources": "Callback registration functions, libvirt API calls, internal callback dictionaries, resource listing functions.",
  "sinks": "User-provided callback functions invoked with event data, untrusted data flows from libvirt into callbacks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from libvirt API calls into internal dictionaries and callback invocations; user callbacks are called with event data, potentially untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard exception handling and resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard callback registration, deregistration, and dispatching patterns for libvirt events. Callbacks are stored in dictionaries and invoked with data from libvirt, which is expected behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is executing user-provided callbacks, which is inherent in event-driven systems but not malicious by itself. The code relies on external libvirt functions assumed to be secure. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of libvirt event management. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The main risk is the execution of untrusted callbacks, which is a known and accepted pattern in such systems. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
