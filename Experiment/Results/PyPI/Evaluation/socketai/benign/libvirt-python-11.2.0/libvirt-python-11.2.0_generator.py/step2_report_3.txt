  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a code generator for libvirt bindings, parsing XML API descriptions, reading override scripts, and generating C and Python code. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. External override scripts could be a vector if tampered with, but this is standard practice.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external script inclusion risk)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior detected within the code itself. External scripts are a potential attack vector but are part of standard extension mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the script is a legitimate code generator, with external override scripts being the main potential risk if compromised. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Same conclusion. The code is a standard code generator with typical extension points.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the script is a code generator for libvirt, with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network or system activity. External override scripts could be a risk if untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, consistent, and detailed reasoning. No malware or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the script's purpose as a code generator with no malicious behavior, operating on static input files. External scripts are a potential attack vector but not malicious in the code itself.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Well-justified. No malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the fact that the script loads external override Python scripts which could contain malicious code if replaced, but the script itself only reads and copies their content into generated code, not executing untrusted code directly. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The core script is safe; the only concern is external scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree the script does not contain malware or malicious payloads. The primary concern is external override scripts, which are standard in code generation tools.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** The overall risk is low, primarily due to external script inclusion, which is a common and accepted pattern but should be managed carefully.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code within the script)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (due to external scripts, but not inherent maliciousness)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured code generator for libvirt bindings, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The main security consideration is ensuring that external override scripts are from trusted sources.",
