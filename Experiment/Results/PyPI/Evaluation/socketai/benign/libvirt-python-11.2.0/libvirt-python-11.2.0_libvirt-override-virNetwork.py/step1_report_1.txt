{
  "purpose": "The function lists all network ports associated with a network object and returns a list of port objects.",
  "sources": "The function calls libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts to retrieve port data.",
  "sinks": "The function processes and returns a list of virNetworkPort objects based on retrieved data.",
  "flows": "Input from libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts flows into the list comprehension that creates virNetworkPort objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code calls an external library function to retrieve data and then processes that data into objects. No user input is directly read; the data source is external but controlled through a library API. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The exception handling is standard. The code appears to be a typical wrapper around a system call, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper function that interfaces with a libvirt API to list network ports. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
