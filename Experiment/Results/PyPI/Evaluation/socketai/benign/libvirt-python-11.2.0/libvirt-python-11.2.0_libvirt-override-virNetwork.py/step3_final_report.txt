  "purpose": "Retrieve and list all network ports associated with a libvirt network object, returning a list of port objects.",
  "sources": "External libvirt API call: libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts(self._o, flags)",
  "sinks": "Construction of virNetworkPort objects from the retrieved data",
  "flows": "libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts -> check for None -> list comprehension creating virNetworkPort objects",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward API wrapper with standard error handling",
  "analysis": "The code calls an external API to list network ports, raises an exception if the call fails, and wraps each returned port into a virNetworkPort object. All reports confirm the code's simplicity, correctness, and lack of suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the external API's use is standard. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects the straightforward analysis. Overall, the code is a safe, standard wrapper with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper with proper error handling. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating minimal security risk and no malware presence.",
