{
  "purpose": "The function lists all network ports associated with a virtual network object.",
  "sources": "The function calls libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts() to retrieve port data, which is an external library function that returns a list of port objects or None.",
  "sinks": "The code converts each retrieved port object into a virNetworkPort instance; potential sinks are the creation of objects from external data and the raising of exceptions if the external call fails.",
  "flows": "Data flows from libvirtmod.virNetworkListAllPorts() (source) to the creation of virNetworkPort objects (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The function relies on an external library function; no data manipulation or external communication is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code calls an external library function to list network ports and handles failure by raising an exception. It then wraps each returned port object into a class instance. No data leakage, injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The function appears standard for an API wrapper, with no unusual or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API call wrapper that retrieves and processes network port data. It does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
