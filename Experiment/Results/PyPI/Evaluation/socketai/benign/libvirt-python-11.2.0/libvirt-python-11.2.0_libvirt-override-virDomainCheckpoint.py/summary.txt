  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe wrapper around libvirt API functions for managing VM checkpoints. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the minimal inherent risk of API interactions. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified."
