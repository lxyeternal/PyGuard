  "purpose": "Wrapper functions around libvirt API calls to manage VM checkpoints and domain connections.",
  "sources": "self.connect(), self.domain(), libvirtmod.virDomainCheckpointListAllChildren()",
  "sinks": "None; data flows from internal API calls, no untrusted input processed",
  "flows": "Methods call libvirt API functions; no external data flow or user input involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API wrapper with standard error handling",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple getter methods and a list retrieval function with error handling. It interacts solely with libvirt APIs, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage. The functions do not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The error handling is standard, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and direct API usage suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe wrapper around libvirt API functions for managing VM checkpoints. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the minimal inherent risk of API interactions. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
