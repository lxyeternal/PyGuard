{
  "purpose": "The code configures Sphinx documentation settings for the 'Schwifty' project, including paths, extensions, and HTML theme options.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the os, sys, datetime modules, and schwifty package attributes such as __version__.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Uses schwifty.__version__ to set version information in documentation; no user input or untrusted data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard configuration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a package 'schwifty' solely for version info. It modifies sys.path for module discovery, sets various configuration options for Sphinx documentation, and references schwifty.__version__ for versioning. No data input, processing, or output that could be malicious is present. The code does not execute any dynamic code, network connections, or system modifications. It is purely configuration code with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Sphinx configuration script that imports and uses package metadata for documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
