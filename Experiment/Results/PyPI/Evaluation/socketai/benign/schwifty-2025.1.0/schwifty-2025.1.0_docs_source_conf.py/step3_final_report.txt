{
  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, importing 'schwifty' solely to access its version information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'schwifty.__version__' after importing the package; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Import of 'schwifty' leads to access of its '__version__' attribute; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors; import of 'schwifty' could be a concern if the package is malicious, but the script itself does not execute code from it beyond attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration for Sphinx, importing standard modules and 'schwifty' to retrieve version info. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import of 'schwifty' is benign if the package is trustworthy; otherwise, it could pose a dependency risk. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script and the dependency consideration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the 'schwifty' package, which is outside the scope of this static analysis. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
