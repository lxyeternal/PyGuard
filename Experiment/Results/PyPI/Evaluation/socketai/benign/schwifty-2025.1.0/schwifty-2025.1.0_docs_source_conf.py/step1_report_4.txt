  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the Schwifty project.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, sys, datetime, schwifty), sys.path modification, schwifty.__version__ access.",
  "sinks": "None found. No untrusted data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and configuration setup, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the Sphinx documentation environment, modifies sys.path, imports project version, and defines configuration variables for documentation output. The import of schwifty.__version__ could be examined if schwifty is malicious, but without external network or data handling, this appears benign. No code injection, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward configuration with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard setup script that does not interact with external data sources or perform harmful actions.",
