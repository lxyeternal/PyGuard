  "purpose": "This code configures the settings for generating Sphinx documentation for the Schwifty project.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (os, sys, datetime, typing), and schwifty module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; configuration variables and imports do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The sys.path modification is standard for local module resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up documentation build parameters, including path adjustments, theme options, project metadata, and extensions. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are processed or executed dynamically. There are no indications of malicious behavior or backdoors. All operations are static configuration settings typical for Sphinx documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
