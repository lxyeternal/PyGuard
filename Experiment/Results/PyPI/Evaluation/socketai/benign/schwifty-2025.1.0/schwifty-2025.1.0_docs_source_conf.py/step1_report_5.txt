{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation, including project metadata and theme options.",
  "sources": "Reading project version from schwifty.__version__, importing modules os, sys, datetime, typing, and schwifty; accessing environment variables via sys.path and potential user-supplied data in source files.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or data leakage; no code executes external commands or handles untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily initializes configuration variables and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is standard configuration with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard modules and a custom module 'schwifty' to retrieve version information. It modifies sys.path to include a parent directory, which is typical for local package access. The configuration variables set up documentation parameters and theme options. There are no indications of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. All code appears to serve legitimate configuration purposes without any suspicious patterns or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard setup tasks safely and predictably.",
