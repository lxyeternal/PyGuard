{
  "purpose": "The code manages registry data through loading, merging, expanding, indexing, and manipulating JSON files stored in package resources. It provides utilities for data consolidation and transformation without external communication.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from package resource directories, loads data into memory, and applies functions to in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external network or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON files -> merges or expands data -> stores in internal registry -> applies transformations via manipulate() function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'assert' statements for type checks; the manipulate() function accepts arbitrary callables, which could be misused if untrusted functions are supplied, but this is a controlled pattern in data utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code loads JSON registry files, merging or expanding data as needed, and stores the results internally. The manipulate() function allows applying arbitrary functions to the data, which could be risky if untrusted functions are used, but in typical trusted environments, this is acceptable. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, with clear data handling and no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign registry management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential misuse of the manipulate() function with untrusted functions, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
