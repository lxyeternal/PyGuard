  "purpose": "This code manages registries by loading, merging, and manipulating JSON data files stored in package resources. It appears to support dynamic data loading and indexing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files from package resource directories, especially during get() calls which load and parse JSON files dynamically.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing back data to the _registry dictionary via save(), which updates in-memory storage. No direct writing to external files or network activity is observed. Manipulate() applies transformations, but does not leak data outside memory.",
  "flows": "get() reads JSON files (source) and loads data into memory (sink). merge_dicts() combines data structures. build_index() retrieves data and creates indices based on criteria. manipulate() modifies in-memory data via provided functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious malicious or suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code. Use of 'assert' statements for type assertions may be considered a minor concern but is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data loading, merging, and indexing from JSON files embedded as package resources. It uses safe file access and JSON parsing, with no external network operations, no eval or exec usage, and no cryptographic functions. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects are evident. The logic appears to be for configuration or data management purposes. The use of 'assert' is standard, and the functions are straightforward without obfuscated logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data management utility for handling registry data stored as JSON files within package resources. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs file-based data loading, merging, indexing, and in-memory manipulation securely. The overall security risk score is low.",
