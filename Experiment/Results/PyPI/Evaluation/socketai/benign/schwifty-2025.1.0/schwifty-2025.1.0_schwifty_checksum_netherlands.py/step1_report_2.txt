{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated checksum algorithm for Dutch IBANs, specifically for validating account codes.",
  "sources": "Imports from schwifty and schwifty.domain modules; class attributes and methods; the validate method reads the components list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no external communication, no data leaks, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input components are used internally in the validate method; no external data flow or untrusted data handling outside the class context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the algorithm explicitly states it is deprecated and not used for current standards.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules and defines a class representing a non-active checksum algorithm. The validate method performs a simple checksum calculation on an account code, which is a straightforward, non-malicious operation. No external data is sent, no system modifications, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves a deprecated validation purpose with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deprecated checksum implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, domain-specific utility class with no harmful actions.",
