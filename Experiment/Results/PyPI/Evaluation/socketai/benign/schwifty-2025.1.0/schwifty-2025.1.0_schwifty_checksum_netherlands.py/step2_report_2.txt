  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines a deprecated or non-used checksum algorithm for Dutch IBANs.\n- The code is straightforward, performing internal checksum validation without external communication.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the descriptions; it is a simple, domain-specific validation class.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors are evident; the code appears correct for its purpose.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0 across all reports.\n  - Security risk: consistently 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - Confidence: high (0.9-1.0), reflecting consensus on benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The code is deprecated and not used anymore, but that doesn't imply maliciousness.\n- The checksum calculation is simple and standard, with no external effects.\n- No signs of hidden malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, domain-specific validation utility.\n- No changes needed in scores or conclusions.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, does not perform any malicious actions, and is only used for validation of deprecated standards.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, benign, and carries no security risks. The assigned scores reflect this well.",
