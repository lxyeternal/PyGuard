  "purpose": "Define a custom checksum algorithm for Dutch IBAN components, specifically for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, class attributes, and method parameters (components).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; methods operate on provided component data without external output or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input components (e.g., account code) flow into validation logic and checksum computation within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no external network calls, no data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a checksum algorithm, with methods to compute and validate checksum values. The validate method sums digit products and checks for divisibility, which appears to be a standard validation routine. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, nor any hidden behaviors. The import of modules is standard, and no suspicious or malicious logic is evident. The code is straightforward and functions as a validation utility without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, harmless implementation of a checksum validation algorithm for IBAN components, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
