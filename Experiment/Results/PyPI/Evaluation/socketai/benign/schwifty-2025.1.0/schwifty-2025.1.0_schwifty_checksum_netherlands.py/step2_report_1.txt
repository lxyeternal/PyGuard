  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code defines a deprecated or non-used checksum algorithm for Dutch IBANs.\n- The code performs internal calculations with no external data flow, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The checksum validation logic is straightforward and domain-specific.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and matches the described classes and methods.\n- **Malicious indicators:** None are evident; no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code performs checksum validation; no external inputs are processed insecurely, and no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, securityRisk=0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very low (0.0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- No justification exists for higher malware or security risk scores.\n- The code is purely domain-specific validation logic with no external effects or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings and the straightforward, domain-specific nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Additional note:** Since the code is deprecated and not used anymore, its presence does not introduce any risk, and its benign nature is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                       | No malicious activity, no suspicious behavior             |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                       | Code is clear, no obfuscation present                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or security issues detected           |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and does not pose any security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
