{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to bank account validation and generation in a Schwifty application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class hierarchy with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from ValueError, serving as custom exceptions for specific validation errors. All classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The exception classes include descriptive docstrings, and no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard error handling classes intended for a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of custom exception classes used for validation error reporting within a bank account processing system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is benign, well-structured, and designed solely for error handling.",
