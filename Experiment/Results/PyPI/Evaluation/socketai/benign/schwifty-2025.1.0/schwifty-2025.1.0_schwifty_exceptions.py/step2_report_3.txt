  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, external input, or dynamic code.\n   - No issues such as obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign, straightforward, and solely for error categorization.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of security-sensitive operations.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty based on the code review.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5; all are at 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is purely for error handling with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made; all analyses are based solely on the code provided.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for validation purposes.\n- It does not process data, interact with external systems, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
