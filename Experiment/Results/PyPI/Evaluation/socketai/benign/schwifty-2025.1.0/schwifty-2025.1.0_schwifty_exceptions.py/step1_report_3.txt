  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to IBAN and bank code validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and docstrings without reading external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, I/O operations, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; as no data processing or flow occurs in class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains custom exception class definitions for validation errors related to bank account data. There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The class GenerateRandomOverflowError may relate to random entity generation, but it is only a descriptive exception class with no implementation details or external data handling. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a set of exception classes for validation purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
