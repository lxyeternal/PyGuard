  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to IBAN and bank validation.\n- No data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: error categorization for validation errors.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 1 in some reports, 0 in others. Since the code is purely class definitions with no security-sensitive operations, a risk score of 0.0 would be more accurate.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports assign a risk score of 1 in some cases, citing the purpose as error handling for validation errors. However, error class definitions alone do not constitute a security risk unless they are part of a larger malicious payload or used in an attack vector.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, external calls, or data leaks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, safe, and intended for validation error categorization.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The risk scores should be uniformly low (closer to 0) because defining exception classes alone does not pose a security threat.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero), since there's no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe report's scoring is generally appropriate, but the risk scores could be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature of the code. The code itself is safe, non-malicious, and standard for error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I recommend:**\n- Confirming that the scores reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- Adjusting the risk scores to 0 for all reports, given the code's benign nature.\n- Maintaining malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\nThis step-by-step reasoning confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any security risks.",
