  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code appears benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence) — appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 — correct, no obfuscation detected.\n     - `malware`: 0 — consistent with the benign code.\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 — justified, as no security issues are present.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores since the code is purely for error categorization.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified and consistent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely for defining exception classes.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to zero.\n- The confidence scores are justified at full confidence.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the analysis, I agree with the existing scores.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The overall assessment confirms that this code segment is safe and poses no security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.",
