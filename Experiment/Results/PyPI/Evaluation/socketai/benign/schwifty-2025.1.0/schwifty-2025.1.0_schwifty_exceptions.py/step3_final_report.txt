{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for categorizing validation errors related to IBAN, bank codes, and random entity generation overflow errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from SchwiftyException, serving as error categories. There are no data flows, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static, clear, and standard for error handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. Confidence scores of 1 are justified given the simplicity and clarity. No evidence suggests malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for validation error categorization. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
