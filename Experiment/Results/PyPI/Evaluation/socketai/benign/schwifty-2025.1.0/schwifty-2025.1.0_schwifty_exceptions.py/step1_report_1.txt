{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to validation errors in a financial or data processing context, particularly for IBAN or bank-related structures.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code solely defines exception classes without processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base SchwiftyException, used to categorize specific validation errors such as invalid length, structure, country code, bank code, branch code, account code, and checksum errors. Additionally, there is a class for overflow errors during random entity generation. All classes are simple, solely containing docstrings and inheritance, with no dynamic code, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes intended for validation error handling in a financial validation context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and solely for error categorization.",
