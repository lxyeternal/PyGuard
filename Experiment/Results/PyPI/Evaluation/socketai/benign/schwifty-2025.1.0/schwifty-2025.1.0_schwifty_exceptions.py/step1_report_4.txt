{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions related to 'schwifty' validation and processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and docstrings, no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources and sensitive sinks; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from ValueError, with descriptive docstrings. No data input, network communication, or processing logic is included. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception handling in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. No sensitive information, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions intended for validation and error reporting. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
