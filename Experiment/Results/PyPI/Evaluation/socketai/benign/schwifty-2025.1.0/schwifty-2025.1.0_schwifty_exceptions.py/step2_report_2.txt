  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities in the provided code snippets.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-documented, and typical for error handling in validation frameworks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that the reports emphasize the absence of data flow or external interactions, which is correct but expected for class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clear, simple nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary for the scores; they are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, the risk is minimal.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the provided code.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (minimal, inherent risk in any code, but practically none here)\n\n**Final note**:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign appropriate scores. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
