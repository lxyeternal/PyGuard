  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Schwifty validation and processing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from ValueError. No data input, external calls, or dynamic execution present. The class structures and comments are straightforward and consistent with standard Python coding practices for error handling. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or security risks detected. The code appears to be a benign part of a larger validation framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions for validation errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard implementation for error handling in Python.",
