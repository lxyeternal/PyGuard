{
  "purpose": "A utility class for string normalization, comparison, and representation, primarily used for consistent string handling.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided during class instantiation and the 'clean' function which processes these strings.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal methods operate solely on the string data without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input strings are cleaned via the 'clean' function during object creation, then used in comparison, hashing, and representation methods internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of 'str' with added methods for comparison, copying, and properties for normalized ('compact') string and length. The 'clean' function removes whitespace and converts strings to uppercase, serving as a normalization step. All operations are internal and do not involve external data, network, or file I/O. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no external dependencies or risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this safety profile.",
