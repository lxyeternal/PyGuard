{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes related to banking identifiers and exposes them for external use, and retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's own version via importlib.metadata and imports classes from the 'schwifty' library modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports modules and sets __all__ and __version__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module initialization tasks: importing specific classes, defining __all__ for exports, and retrieving the package version. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious operations. All actions are typical for Python package modules. The imported classes are from a legitimate library, and the version retrieval is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
