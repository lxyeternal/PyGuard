  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `version` from `importlib.metadata`.\n- Imports classes `BBAN`, `BIC`, `IBAN` from `schwifty` submodules.\n- Defines `__all__` to expose these classes.\n- Sets `__version__` using `version(__name__)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Reports 1-5** all conclude:\n- The code is straightforward, importing classes and retrieving the package version.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- The only dynamic operation is retrieving the package version, which is standard.\n\n**Common points:**\n- All reports agree that the code appears benign.\n- The trustworthiness hinges on the `schwifty` package, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of the Security Scores**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, indicating no malicious behavior detected. This is consistent and justified given the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**However,** since the `schwifty` package modules (`schwifty.bban`, `schwifty.bic`, `schwifty.iban`) could potentially contain malicious code, the risk assessment could be slightly higher if the package is untrusted. But from this snippet alone, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2-0.3 could be considered if we account for the trustworthiness of `schwifty`, but given the evidence, 0 is acceptable.\n\n**Given the evidence, I would agree with the reports' scores.** \n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (very low, assuming trust in the package)  \n\n**Note:** If the `schwifty` package is untrusted or from an unverified source, the risk could be higher, but from this code alone, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup that imports classes and retrieves version info. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
