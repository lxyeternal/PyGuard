{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules and defines package metadata, likely for a library related to banking or financial data validation.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function call from importlib.metadata, which retrieves package version information.",
  "flows": "The version information obtained by 'version(__name__)'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears to be straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for banking data structures and retrieves the package's version using importlib.metadata. The __all__ list exposes the imported classes. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. No external input handling, no network activity, or unsafe data processing observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It simply defines exported classes and retrieves package version info.",
