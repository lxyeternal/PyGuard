  "purpose": "Import classes from schwifty modules and retrieve package version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only standard library call to retrieve version.",
  "flows": "Source: version(__name__) -> No data flows to external sinks or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version retrieval with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes BBAN, BIC, IBAN from schwifty modules, defines __all__ for exports, and sets __version__ using importlib.metadata.version(__name__). No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code detected. The only dynamic operation is version retrieval, which is standard. The trustworthiness depends on the external schwifty package, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with no malicious or security concerns evident from this snippet. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.2), justified by reliance on external package trustworthiness. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
