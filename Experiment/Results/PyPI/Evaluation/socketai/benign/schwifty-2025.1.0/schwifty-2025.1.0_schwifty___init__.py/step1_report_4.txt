{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes related to banking identifiers and exposes them for external use, also retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Import of 'version' from importlib.metadata, and imports of classes BBAN, BIC, IBAN from 'schwifty' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling; only standard imports and attribute definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is retrieving version info and exporting classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of importlib.metadata.version is standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from the 'schwifty' library and exposes them via __all__. It also dynamically retrieves the package version using importlib.metadata.version. No code executes untrusted data, no network activity, and no malicious patterns are present. The only dynamic operation is obtaining package version info, which is a common practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer or API interface that re-exports classes and records its version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
