{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes related to banking identifiers and exposes them for external use, while also retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "The version() function from importlib.metadata retrieves the package version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the retrieval of package version via importlib.metadata.version()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The imported modules (schwifty.bban, schwifty.bic, schwifty.iban) could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports classes related to banking identifiers from the 'schwifty' package, and sets the __all__ list for exports. It retrieves the package version dynamically using importlib.metadata.version(). There are no evident malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. Since the module imports components that could potentially contain malicious code, the safety depends on the trustworthiness of the 'schwifty' package, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code functions as a typical module setup, with no suspicious operations detected. The overall security risk appears low, assuming the 'schwifty' package is trustworthy.",
