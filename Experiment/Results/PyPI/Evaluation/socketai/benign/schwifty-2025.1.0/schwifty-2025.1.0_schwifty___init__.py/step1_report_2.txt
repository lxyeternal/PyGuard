{
  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a Python module related to financial identifiers and retrieves the module's version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's version via importlib.metadata.version and imports classes from the 'schwifty' package.",
  "targets": "The code does not include any explicit sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the version retrieval is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The version retrieval is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a package and exposes them via __all__, indicating an intent to define the public API. It retrieves the package version dynamically using importlib.metadata, which is a common and legitimate pattern. No external data inputs, no user inputs, no suspicious code flows, and no malicious or maliciously intended behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal module initialization script.",
