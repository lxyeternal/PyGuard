{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling IBAN and BBAN data, including validation, generation, and lookup of bank account components for different countries.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments (country_code, values, etc.), environment (registry.get), and regex/xeger inputs for random generation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication (not present here), registry lookups, and regex-based data generation; no direct data leaks or external communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments or registry lookups through processing functions, with potential use of regex/xeger for random data generation, and lookup in registries for bank and BIC info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The use of registry lookups and regex-based random generation appears standard. No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of IBAN/BBAN handling with validation, random generation, and registry-based lookup. No signs of malicious behavior such as system data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network activity. The use of regex for data generation and registry for bank info is typical. No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate library for handling bank account data, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates as intended for its domain, with no security threats identified.",
