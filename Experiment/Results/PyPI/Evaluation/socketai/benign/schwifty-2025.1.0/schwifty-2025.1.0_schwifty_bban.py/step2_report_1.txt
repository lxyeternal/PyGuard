  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasonableness of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles BBAN generation and validation, relying on external registries and regex-based random data generation. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable given reliance on external data and randomness.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with risks mainly tied to data integrity of registries and randomness quality. No issues with the logic or reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on registry lookups and regex-based random generation. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The report emphasizes that the code is standard and that risks are external registry data integrity and regex pattern safety, not malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the structure and validation routines, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the findings.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms the code is legitimate, with standard practices and no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a well-structured IBAN/BBAN handler with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly assesses that no malicious activity is present, focusing on the legitimate use of regex and registry data.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code's functions for validation, generation, and lookup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms no malicious behavior or supply chain issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 are consistent, considering external registry reliance and randomness but not indicating high risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The main security concern remains external registry data integrity and the potential misuse of regex-based random generation, but these are standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to external dependencies and randomness, but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears secure with no malicious intent.",
