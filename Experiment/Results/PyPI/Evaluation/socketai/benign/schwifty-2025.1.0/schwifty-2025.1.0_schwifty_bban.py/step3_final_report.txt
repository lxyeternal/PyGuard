{
  "purpose": "The code manages BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number) creation, validation, and lookup, relying on external registry data and regex-based random data generation for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Registry lookups for country and bank data, regex patterns for random BBAN generation, user-provided component values.",
  "sinks": "Registry data access, regex-based string generation, property accessors for components, checksum computations.",
  "flows": "Input data (user components or registry data) -> component extraction and validation -> checksum calculation -> registry lookup for bank info -> output of bank details or validation result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of regex for data generation is standard but could be exploited if regex patterns are malicious, though no evidence suggests this here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for BBAN and IBAN handling, with functions for generating, validating, and retrieving bank information. It relies on external registries and regex-based random data generation, which are common in such systems. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no signs of malicious intent. The code is clear and well-structured, with no obfuscation, justifying an obfuscated score of 0. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering reliance on external data sources and regex patterns, which are typical operational risks but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-implemented, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk primarily relates to external registry data integrity, which is outside the code's control. All reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. No adjustments are necessary.",
