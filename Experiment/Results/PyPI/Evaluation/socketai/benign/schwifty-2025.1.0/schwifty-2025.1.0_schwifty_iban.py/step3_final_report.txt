{
  "purpose": "The code implements an IBAN class for validation, generation, and component extraction, utilizing regex, checksum algorithms, and registry data for country and bank info.",
  "sources": "User input IBAN string, registry data for regex and country info, internal checksum and validation routines.",
  "sinks": "Validation routines process data; no external data leaks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input IBAN → character validation → length and format validation → checksum validation → optional BBAN checksum validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for IBAN handling, performing validation, generation, and data extraction. It uses common libraries, regex, and checksum algorithms. The registry manipulation for regex creation is typical for dynamic validation. No external network activity or malicious behaviors are present. The use of randomness in IBAN generation is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code is transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for IBAN validation and generation. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
