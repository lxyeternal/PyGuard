  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the described flow, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements an IBAN class with validation, generation, and component extraction.\n- Uses regex for format validation, checksum algorithms for integrity.\n- Accesses country and bank info via registry.\n- Contains no network calls, no external data leaks, no obfuscation, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- Uses standard libraries and well-understood algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Clear, detailed explanation of IBAN class functions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate, matches code behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard validation routines, registry manipulation for regex is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, justified)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to report 1, concise summary.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, standard use of libraries, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate IBAN handling code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (reasonable)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard validation and checksum.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, justified by the code's purpose)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; code is for IBAN validation and generation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, standard practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, justified)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; uses standard libraries, regex, checksum algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate IBAN processing code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, justified)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), all justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured IBAN handling library.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to the financial nature but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
