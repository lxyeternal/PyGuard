{
  "purpose": "This code defines an IBAN (International Bank Account Number) class with methods for validation, generation, and component extraction, as well as utilities for handling country-specific formats and regex conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input IBAN strings, bank components (bank_code, account_code, etc.), country codes, and registry data for bank info and specifications.",
  "sinks": "Validation methods process the IBAN data internally; no explicit data sinks (e.g., network, file writes) are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input IBAN strings flow through validation, formatting, and component extraction methods; registry data feeds into regex conversion; no suspicious data flow patterns observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The only dynamic code execution involves regex compilation and registry manipulation, which are standard and controlled. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates IBAN structures, performs checksum calculations, generates IBANs from components, and accesses registry data for country and bank info. The regex conversion and registry manipulation are standard procedures for country-specific formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of external libraries appears to be for legitimate purposes. All code operations are related to financial data handling and validation, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate implementation for IBAN management and validation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of regex, registry data, and checksum algorithms are typical for such financial validation libraries.",
