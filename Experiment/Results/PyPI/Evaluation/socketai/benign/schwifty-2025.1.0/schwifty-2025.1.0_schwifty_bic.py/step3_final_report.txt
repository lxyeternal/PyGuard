{
  "purpose": "The code implements a BIC (Bank Identifier Code) class for validation, parsing, and lookup of BIC data, relying on regex patterns, country data, and external registry sources.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from string values, registry lookups for BIC details, country data via pycountry, and regex matching for validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications; primarily internal data validation and registry access.",
  "flows": "Input string → validation via regex and length checks → registry lookup for details → property accessors for data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of warnings for deprecation is benign. Registry access depends on external data integrity but is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of BIC validation and lookup. It uses regex for pattern validation, validates country codes, and accesses external registry data for details. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The reliance on external registry data is a typical operational dependency, not an indicator of malicious intent. The code's properties and methods are consistent with standard validation modules, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for BIC validation and lookup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score reflects reliance on external data, which is typical and not malicious.",
