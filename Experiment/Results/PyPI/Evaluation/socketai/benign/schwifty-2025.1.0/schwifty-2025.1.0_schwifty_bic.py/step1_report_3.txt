{
  "purpose": "Define and validate a BIC (Bank Identifier Code) object according to ISO 9362:2022, including methods for creation, validation, and lookup of BICs and related bank information.",
  "sources": "Regular expressions for BIC pattern validation; registry data for bank and BIC info; input parameters for methods like country_code and bank_code; external library calls (pycountry).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, as the code mainly performs validation, lookup, and data formatting without network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., bic string, country_code, bank_code) flow through validation and lookup functions; methods generate BIC objects; validation functions verify structure; properties access external data (pycountry) for country info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regular expressions for pattern validation appears standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; warnings are standard deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BIC class with validation and lookup features, relying on regex patterns for structural validation and registry for bank data. Validation methods check length, structure, and country code validity, raising specific exceptions on failure. Lookup methods query a registry for bank info, which is expected to be a secure, internal data store. External dependencies (pycountry, registry) are standard libraries and presumably controlled data sources. There are no network operations, no execution of external code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Warnings are non-malicious deprecation notices. The code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation for BIC validation and lookup with no malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing BICs, performing validation, lookup, and formatting without any signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It depends on trusted libraries and internal registry data, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
