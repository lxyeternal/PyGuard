{
  "purpose": "Define a string enumeration for various account-related identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could leak data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is a simple enum definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines a subclass of str and enum.Enum. It declares several class variables representing different account attributes, each assigned a string value. There are no functions, external input handling, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be a standard, harmless enumeration for use in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum definition without any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It simply defines constant string identifiers for account-related fields.",
