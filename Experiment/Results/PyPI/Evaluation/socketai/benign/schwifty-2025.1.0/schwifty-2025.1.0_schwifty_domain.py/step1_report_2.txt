  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an Enum class inheriting from str and enum.Enum, listing various component identifiers as string values. There are no external inputs, data processing, or potential data leakage points. The code appears to serve as a static configuration or constants definition, with no malicious or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration declaration serving as constants for account-related fields. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
