{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of string constants related to account and banking components for use as enumeration keys.",
  "sources": "Static class variables within the enum class; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; the code is static and does not involve data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward enum definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports enum, defines a class inheriting from str and enum.Enum, and declares several string constants. It is static, with no data processing, external inputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration of string constants used for account-related identifiers. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
