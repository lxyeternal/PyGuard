  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on potential security concerns, malware indicators, obfuscation, and logical consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of static type definitions for AWS ComprehendMedical SDK, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with high confidence, and security risk is also zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** No issues are present. The code strictly defines data structures.\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:** None detected. The code contains no runtime logic, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not process untrusted data at runtime; it only defines types.\n\n### Logical and Scoring Consistency:\n- The reports' assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The purpose and analysis sections are aligned, emphasizing the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Security risks:** None. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Malware potential:** Zero. No malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n- **Potential for misuse:** Minimal, as the code is for static type checking only.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code's sole purpose is to provide type annotations for SDK data structures.\n- It employs standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports for compatibility, and detailed documentation.\n- No runtime, network, or external data handling occurs.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for static type annotation purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:** This code is a benign, standard type definition module with no security concerns.",
