  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS SDK data structures; no external data processing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling, just static type definitions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. Uses standard conditional imports for compatibility.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, purely static, no malware. Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above—type annotations for AWS SDK.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard, with version-based imports.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no malware, risk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for data structures, no runtime logic.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static declarations only.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no secrets, no dynamic code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard static type definitions.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions, with detailed version-dependent imports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The slight confidence reduction (0.95) is reasonable, given the complexity of version handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, no security risks, purely static.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains no malicious behavior. They all assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, assigning 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions, the risk score is rightly 0 across all reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a set of static type definitions intended for static analysis and type safety in SDK development. It contains no dynamic code, no external data processing, no secrets, and no obfuscation. The use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the scores align with the content.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, static type definition module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments are justified and appropriate.",
