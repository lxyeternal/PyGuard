{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS ComprehendMedical SDK data structures for use with boto3, ensuring type safety and clarity in SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module for version checks, literals from local modules, and the actual class and type definitions within the script.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; primarily type definitions with no runtime data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Type definitions are static, only defining data structures; no runtime data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. The code strictly adheres to type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a set of type definitions for AWS SDK responses and requests, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It does not perform any data processing, external data input, network communication, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be to provide structured type annotations for SDK usage. The import statements, conditional logic, and class definitions are standard for this purpose. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive collection of static type definitions intended to enhance type safety for a Python SDK interacting with AWS ComprehendMedical. It contains no malicious behavior, no runtime data handling, and no external interactions. The script is safe and focused solely on type annotations.",
