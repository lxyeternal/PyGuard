{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for AWS ComprehendMedical SDK data structures using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It serves to enhance static analysis, documentation, and type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through type annotations and import statements; no runtime data or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code contains only static type declarations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code solely defines data schemas without processing data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic evaluation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS SDK data structures, employing conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The use of standard typing constructs and documentation indicates a benign purpose. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, with no external interactions or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard, and well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS ComprehendMedical SDK. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks, and is suitable for use in static analysis and type safety enforcement.",
