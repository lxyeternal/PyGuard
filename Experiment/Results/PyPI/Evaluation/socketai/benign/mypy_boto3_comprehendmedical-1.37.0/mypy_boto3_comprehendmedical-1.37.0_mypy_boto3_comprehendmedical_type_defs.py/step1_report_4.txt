  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations for AWS Comprehend Medical SDK data structures and request/response types.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; class and variable definitions for type annotations and request/response schemas.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; primarily static type definitions and data schemas.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code purely defines types without runtime data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union class definitions for structured data used in AWS Comprehend Medical SDK. It uses conditional imports to support multiple Python versions and defines type aliases for various request and response schemas. The code is well-structured, purely declarative, and does not include runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. It adheres to standard practices for type annotations and does not contain any apparent malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified. It is safe for use.",
