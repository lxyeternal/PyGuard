{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Comprehend Medical service responses, requests, and related data structures to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party typing extensions, and local type definition modules; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily declares type definitions without executing any data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; type annotations facilitate static analysis but do not involve runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are present. The code consists solely of type definitions and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for AWS Comprehend Medical API responses and requests, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, runtime operations, or data handling logic that could be malicious. The presence of detailed type annotations and adherence to standard practices suggest it is a benign, well-structured module aimed at static type checking. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious backdoors is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of type definitions for AWS SDK interaction, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for static typing support and does not perform any runtime or network operations that could be malicious.",
