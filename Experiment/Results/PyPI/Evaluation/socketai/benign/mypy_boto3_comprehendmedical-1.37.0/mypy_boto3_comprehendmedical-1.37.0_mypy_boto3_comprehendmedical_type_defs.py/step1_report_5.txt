  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the comprehendmedical service in boto3 stubs, facilitating static type checking and API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys modules, typing, and typing_extensions; external literals module; variable definitions; class and TypedDict definitions; constants; conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines data structures and type annotations without runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is solely static type definitions and class schemas.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or hidden data. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, no eval or exec, and no network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type definitions using TypedDict, union types, and conditional imports for compatibility. It references external literals module for type literals. The purpose is to define clear data schemas for AWS ComprehendMedical API responses and requests. No dynamic or runtime behavior exists, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured, solely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for AWS SDK stubs. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is purely for static analysis and API schema definition.",
