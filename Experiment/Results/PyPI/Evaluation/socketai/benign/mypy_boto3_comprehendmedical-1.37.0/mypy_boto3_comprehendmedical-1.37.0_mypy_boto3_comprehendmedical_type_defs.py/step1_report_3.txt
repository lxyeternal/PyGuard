  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for various data structures used in the comprehendmedical service, mainly for type annotations and data validation in a Python SDK context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, standard library functions, and constant definitions for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are present; the code primarily defines data structures without executing any logic or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up type definitions without processing data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no signs of unusual code execution, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. All imports are standard or version-controlled, and there are no dynamic code evaluations, obfuscated elements, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script strictly defines TypedDict data structures for the purpose of static type checking and documentation within a Python SDK for AWS Comprehend Medical. It includes version-dependent imports, but no runtime logic, external code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The license and documentation comments do not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic eval, suspicious imports, or network activity, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for defining type annotations and data structures related to the comprehendmedical service. There is no malicious behavior, backdoor, or security risk present. The script is standard for SDK type definition files and contains no indicators of sabotage.",
