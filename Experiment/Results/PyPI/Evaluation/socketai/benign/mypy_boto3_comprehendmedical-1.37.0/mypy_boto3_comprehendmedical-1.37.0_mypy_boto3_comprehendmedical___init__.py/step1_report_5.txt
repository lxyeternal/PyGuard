  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the comprehendmedical service, acting as a wrapper to import and expose the ComprehendMedicalClient.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ComprehendMedicalClient' from a relative module; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines and exports classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date in 2025 may be future-dated, but not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class from a local module and re-exports it, including a commented usage example. No external data inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data handling. No network connections, code execution, or data leakage identified. The documentation and code structure are straightforward, serving as an interface wrapper. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple wrapper and interface definition with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious code patterns identified. It appears to be a legitimate component for service access.",
