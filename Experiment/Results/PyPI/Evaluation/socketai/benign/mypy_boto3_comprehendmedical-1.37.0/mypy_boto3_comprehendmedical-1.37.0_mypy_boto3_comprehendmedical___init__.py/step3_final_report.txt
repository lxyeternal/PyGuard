  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025)",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via __all__. It contains only documentation, import statements, and variable assignments. No data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The only unusual element is the future year (2025), which is benign. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK interface wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior. The minor anomaly of the future date does not indicate any threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
