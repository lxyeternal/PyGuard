  "purpose": "Main interface for the comprehendmedical service, providing access to the ComprehendMedicalClient.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.client' and the embedded documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up an alias and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides documentation and sets up an alias for the client class. It imports a class from a local module and exposes it as 'Client'. There are no data input points, no data processing, and no external network operations. The presence of a future copyright year is odd but not harmful. The structure is simple, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. No potential security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It serves as a simple wrapper and documentation for the comprehendmedical client class.",
