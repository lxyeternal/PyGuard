  "purpose": "To provide an interface for the comprehendmedical service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.client) and the documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; code does not process or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, mostly consisting of documentation, import, and assignment statements. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains documentation and a simple import and aliasing pattern. It imports a client class from a local module and assigns it to a variable named Client. No external data handling, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is clean, minimal, and standard for an SDK interface. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK interface setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely provides a client alias for the comprehendmedical service without performing any suspicious actions.",
