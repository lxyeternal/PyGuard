  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS comprehendmedical service and related enumerations for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; defining string literal types for various AWS service constants and categories.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input, data output, or external communication occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only establishes type aliases and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright notice with a future year (2025) which may be incorrect but is not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares a series of type aliases for string literals representing various categories, types, and service names relevant to AWS comprehendmedical. All definitions are static, hardcoded strings with no dynamic or external code execution. The file serves as a static typing utility, with no code executing at runtime beyond type annotations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent are present. The only concern might be the future copyright year which appears to be a typo or placeholder but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definitions module for AWS comprehendmedical and related constants. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external communication. No malware or security risks are present. It appears to be a benign, purely declarative utility file with no malicious intent.",
