  "purpose": "Define type annotations for comprehendmedical service literal definitions and related types for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources input data from user-defined string literals for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; it solely sets type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is purely declarative with no dynamic or runtime data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then defines multiple Literal type aliases representing various categories of medical and AWS service identifiers. The code appears to be a straightforward static type definitions module, with no functions, no data processing, no I/O, and no runtime logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, and no external data sources. All identifiers are fixed string literals used for type annotations, which is typical for schema-like definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage; the code is intended for type safety and static analysis support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for static type checking, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for defining literal types for enums or fixed categories. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code is safe and solely intended for type annotations.",
