  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code defines static type aliases for various string literals related to comprehendmedical and AWS services. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the static nature of the type alias definitions, the conditional import, and the absence of runtime or external code.\n- **Anomaly Noted:** The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates. While unusual, this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly assesses the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports, confirms that the code only contains static type definitions with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to prior assessments, emphasizes the static, benign nature of the code. Notes the conditional import pattern and the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code as static type aliases for AWS and comprehendmedical literals, with no runtime or external interactions. Mentions the presence of license comments and version-dependent imports, which are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions for literals used in static type checking.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** Minor note on the future copyright year in Report 2, but this is likely a placeholder, not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk or attack surface.\n\n**Additional Justification:**\n\nGiven the nature of the code—static type definitions with no runtime logic, no data flow, and no external dependencies or inputs—there's no plausible avenue for security compromise or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the future copyright year, which is a typo or placeholder, not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured static type annotations module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
