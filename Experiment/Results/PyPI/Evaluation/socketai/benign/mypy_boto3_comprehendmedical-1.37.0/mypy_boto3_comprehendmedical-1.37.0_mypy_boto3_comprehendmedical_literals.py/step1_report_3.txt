  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for various literals used in the comprehendmedical service for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions; assigns multiple Literal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions are static and do not involve runtime data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type alias definitions for various string literal types used in the package. It includes conditional import logic based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions for static type checking, with no signs of malicious activity or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, purely declarative set of type definitions intended for static typing support. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident.",
