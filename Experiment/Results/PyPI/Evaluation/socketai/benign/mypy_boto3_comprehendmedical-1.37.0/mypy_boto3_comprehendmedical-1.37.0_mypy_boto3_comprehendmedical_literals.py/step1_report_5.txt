{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for comprehendmedical service literals and related AWS service identifiers for type checking.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned to variables like AttributeNameType, EntityTypeType, ServiceName, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely type annotation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license-like comments and version-dependent imports; no unusual code behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to handle different Python versions for 'Literal' import, then defines multiple 'Literal' type aliases for various categories related to comprehendmedical and AWS services. The definitions are static and only serve as type hints for static type checkers. No runtime data processing, input handling, or external interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The purpose is purely to provide type annotations for code correctness and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard type annotation module for AWS comprehendmedical literals and service names. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured, and documented piece of code for type safety.",
