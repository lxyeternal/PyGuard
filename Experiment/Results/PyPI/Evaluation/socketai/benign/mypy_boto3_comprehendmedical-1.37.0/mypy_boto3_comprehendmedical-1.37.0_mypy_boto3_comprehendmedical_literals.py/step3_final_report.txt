  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS comprehendmedical and related service literals using Python's Literal type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only defines static type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static definitions do not process runtime data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Minor anomaly: the copyright year '2025' is in the future, likely a placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for various categories used in AWS comprehendmedical and other AWS services. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors are present. The conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version is standard. The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor future copyright year is likely a placeholder and does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.",
