  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for comprehendmedical literals; purely static definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; static type aliasing only.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; the copyright year (2025) appears to be a future placeholder, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, purely declarative, with no runtime or dynamic behavior. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.5 risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature, with malware score 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions for AWS comprehendmedical constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The future copyright year (2025) is suspicious but likely a placeholder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type aliases, no runtime code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.5 risk score is reasonable; malware score 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for comprehendmedical, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the code is purely static.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe for supply chain.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.5 risk, malware 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type alias definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, static, no malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.5 risk, malware 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, static literal definitions for comprehendmedical and AWS services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard type annotation definitions, safe.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.5 risk, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code is purely static type alias definitions with no dynamic or runtime behavior. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** The risk scores of 0.5 seem to be a conservative baseline for non-issue code. Since these are type annotations, a score of 0 might be more precise, but 0.5 is acceptable as a cautious estimate. Malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware concerns:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities but correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Could be lowered to 0, since this is purely static type definitions with no security risk. However, if the scoring system defaults to 0.5 for non-issue code, it’s acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0                   | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0                   | Code is clear, static, and non-obfuscated.                   |\n| Risk Score       | 0                   | No security risk; purely static type annotations.           |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for static type checking. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
