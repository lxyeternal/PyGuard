  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static type alias definitions using `Literal` for various categories, constants, and service identifiers.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or untrusted input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or secrets.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions for comprehendmedical literals.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes static string literal types for AWS comprehendmedical.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the future year 2025 as a potential typo, which is accurate but not malicious.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, confirms static literal definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies besides the future year, which is benign.\n- **Security:** No malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as previous, static type alias definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Security:** No malware or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, static type annotations for AWS comprehendmedical literals.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions license comments and version-dependent imports, which are standard.\n- **Security:** No malware, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. **Set to 0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected. **Set to 0**.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or external data, the risk is negligible. **Set to 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are accurate and justified.\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a typo but doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.",
