  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for various categories related to AWS comprehendmedical and other AWS services.\n- The import logic for `Literal` is conditional based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code, runtime data handling, I/O, or external data sources are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity/documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases with no runtime logic or data processing.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The only minor anomaly is the copyright year \"2025\" which is in the future, possibly a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n#### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- **Malware score = 0** in all reports. This is correct; the code is static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscated = 0**; no obfuscation detected.\n\n#### Security risk:\n- **Security risk = 0**; no runtime execution, external data, or secrets involved.\n\n#### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about untrusted input or external data.\n- No code execution, network calls, or external dependencies at runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of individual reports:\nAll reports are consistent, thorough, and conclude the code is benign. They correctly identify the code as a static type annotation utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n  No malware activity or malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n  No security risks are present; the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The future copyright year \"2025\" is likely a typo or placeholder, but this is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation |\n|------------------|----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0                    |\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for static analysis support, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or further analysis?**",
