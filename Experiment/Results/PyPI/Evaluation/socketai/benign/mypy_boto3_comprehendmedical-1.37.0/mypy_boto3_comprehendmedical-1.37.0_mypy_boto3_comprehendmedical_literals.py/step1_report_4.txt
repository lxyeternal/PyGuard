  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in AWS comprehendmedical service and related types.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and the definitions of various Literal types.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines type aliases and literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only creates type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behaviors, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliasing for various literal string types relevant to AWS services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is a common pattern. There are no data inputs, network operations, file access, or external calls. No malicious constructs are present; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type definition module for AWS comprehendmedical literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply facilitates type checking and documentation.",
