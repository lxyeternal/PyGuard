  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely interface/type stub with no executable logic, no data handling, no external data flow, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies this as a safe, standard type stub.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, primarily type annotations and interface definitions. The only mention of potential concern is that method parameters are unpacked request types, which could contain untrusted data if misused.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk is 0.1, malware is 0. This is reasonable because, despite the potential for untrusted data in parameters, the code itself doesn't process or handle data directly.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is cautious but accurate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—interface definitions with no logic or data handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, just type annotations and method signatures. Potential data flow from parameters into API calls, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1. This is appropriate, considering the potential for untrusted data in parameters but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—interface with no executable logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm that the code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Risk Level:** Very low; mainly the potential for untrusted data in request parameters, which is standard for SDK wrappers.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor potential concern due to passing untrusted data into SDK calls, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is a standard, well-typed SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
