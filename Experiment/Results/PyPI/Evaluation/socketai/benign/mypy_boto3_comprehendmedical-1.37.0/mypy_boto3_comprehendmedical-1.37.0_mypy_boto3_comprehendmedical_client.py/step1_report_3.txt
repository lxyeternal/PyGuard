  "purpose": "Type annotations and class interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical client, enabling type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class attributes and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions; no direct handling of untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "Method calls with unpacked parameters from type definitions; no evident data flow from external untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations and a client interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical SDK, including exception handling classes and method signatures aligned with AWS API endpoints. It employs conditional imports for compatibility, and all method parameters are unpacked from predefined type definitions. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network communications, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, type-annotated interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical client, serving as a type-safe wrapper around AWS SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code.",
