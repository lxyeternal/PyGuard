  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature, the scores assigned, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is a type stub/interface for AWS ComprehendMedical with no malicious intent, no executable logic, and no data handling beyond type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default), confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is purely a type stub for static analysis, with no runtime behavior or data processing. The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a structured, type-safe SDK wrapper with detailed method signatures, no malicious activity, and standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 suggests a very minor concern, perhaps due to the potential for misuse if request parameters are untrusted. However, the code itself doesn't process untrusted data directly; it merely defines an interface.\n- **Justification for risk:** Since the code handles request parameters that could, in theory, be crafted maliciously by an attacker, a very low risk score is acceptable. No malware or obfuscation is indicated.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No suspicious elements detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for data leaks if untrusted input is passed, but emphasizes that the code is mainly type annotations and API interface wrappers.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) accounts for the possibility that if request data is untrusted, it could lead to issues downstream. Given that this is a static interface, this is a conservative but reasonable assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlighting the code as a standard, safe API wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no executable code, network activity, or suspicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the potential for misuse if request parameters are untrusted, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static, type-annotated interface/stub for AWS SDK, with no runtime logic, no data handling, and no malicious code.\n- The minimal risk scores are justified by the fact that, although the interface accepts external input, it does not process or execute it maliciously.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** (very low; only potential concern if used improperly, but no actual vulnerability)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as a type stub/interface for a well-known SDK.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and designed for static analysis and type safety, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
