  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS ComprehendMedical client, serving as a static SDK wrapper with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from request type definitions, and internal class properties.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from method parameters into API calls; no direct data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Unpack request parameters into API method calls; no runtime data processing or external data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and method signatures for the AWS ComprehendMedical SDK client, designed for static type checking and IDE support. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The methods unpack request parameters defined by imported type definitions, which could, in theory, contain untrusted data, but the code itself does not process or handle data insecurely. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's static, interface-only nature, with minimal potential for misuse if used improperly. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and serves as a well-structured SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, type-annotated interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical SDK with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its nature. No improvements or modifications are necessary.",
