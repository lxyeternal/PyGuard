{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical service, providing methods to interact with medical data processing jobs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class and method definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is passed to request parameters; methods returning job descriptions and statuses.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into AWS API calls; responses and exceptions flow back to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code primarily defines type annotations and API interface wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client class with method signatures, properties, and exception types for interacting with AWS services. It uses standard imports and follows documented API patterns. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or harmful behavior are evident. The presence of detailed type annotations and method signatures indicates a focus on type safety and clarity, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-stub style client interface for AWS ComprehendMedical. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. It functions as a safe, structured API wrapper with clear, documented method signatures and exception handling.",
