  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report correctly identifies that the code is purely interface and type definitions with no executable logic or data handling.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The report notes the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5. Given no malicious activity, the risk score could reasonably be lower, perhaps 0.1 or 0.2, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a static type stub, safe by design.\n- **Overall:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The analysis indicates standard SDK wrapper code with detailed type annotations.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None observed.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Slightly higher than report 1, possibly reflecting the mention that input parameters could contain untrusted data, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, only interface definitions.\n- **Overall:** The risk score is appropriate; no malware detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to previous reports, standard SDK interface.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The risk is minimal, consistent with a safe interface.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just type annotations.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable scores.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report emphasizes that the code is a type stub with no malicious logic.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Slightly higher risk score, perhaps due to potential data flow, but no actual risk detected.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; just API interface code.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Consistent with previous findings, a straightforward API wrapper.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The risk is minimal, as expected.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code (interface/type stub). A more conservative estimate might be 0.0 or 0.1, but 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS ComprehendMedical with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk in handling external data, but no actual risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves as a type stub/interface for the AWS SDK.
