  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is purely a type stub/interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical client, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that the code is a structured, type-safe SDK wrapper with detailed type annotations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, likely due to the nature of SDK wrappers that handle untrusted data only when used at runtime.\n- **Verdict:** Justified and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, confirms the code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Notes that while the code handles potential data flows, it remains a safe, type-annotated API wrapper without malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — acceptable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard, safe SDK interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with minor 0.1 in some reports, reflecting the low risk of SDK interface code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**This code is a standard, well-typed SDK interface for AWS ComprehendMedical, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.**",
