{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definition for AWS ComprehendMedical service.",
  "sources": "Constant string documentation links, imported modules, class and method definitions, type annotations, property definitions, and exception handling structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; standard method signatures and documentation strings, no code execution, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are primarily interface definitions with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual implementation code, only interface signatures and documentation. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. All code appears to be standard type definitions and API client interface.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client interface for the AWS ComprehendMedical service with detailed type annotations, exception classes, and documentation links. It imports necessary modules, defines exception mappings, and specifies method signatures for various AWS API operations without executing logic or handling untrusted input data. The class and method structures follow AWS SDK conventions. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a type stub for static analysis and API interface purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type stub/interface for AWS ComprehendMedical client with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not execute any logic or handle untrusted data. It is safe and intended for type checking and IDE autocompletion.",
