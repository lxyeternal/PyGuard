  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. All reports agree that it only prints fixed strings based on command-line arguments, with no dynamic input processing, network activity, or code execution.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code's simplicity and benign nature. No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Security risk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)  \n   \n   These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely informational with no malicious or risky behavior, risk scores should remain at 0. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All claims are grounded in the code's actual behavior—static output, no external data, no dynamic code execution—so no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, static, and has no security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's behavior.",
