  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the boto3 ComprehendMedical package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (for output), potential for input via sys.argv (but not used maliciously here)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (if '--version') -> print_version -> stdout; otherwise -> print_info -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and only outputs static informational text.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and processes command-line arguments. The only control flow checks for '--version' argument to determine which info to print. All outputs are static strings or version numbers. There are no user inputs processed beyond the command-line argument check, no network activity, no environment variable usage, and no code execution or data manipulation beyond printing fixed strings. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to serve a simple CLI purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that prints static package info and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe and standard in structure.",
