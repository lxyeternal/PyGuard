  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static data, no dynamic input, no external data, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It imports only standard library modules, processes arguments simply, and prints fixed strings. No network activity, environment variable manipulation, code injection, or dynamic execution occurs. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is clear, and the code is well-structured. All signals indicate benign, static behavior with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility that outputs package info and version. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are consistent with its behavior, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe for use.",
