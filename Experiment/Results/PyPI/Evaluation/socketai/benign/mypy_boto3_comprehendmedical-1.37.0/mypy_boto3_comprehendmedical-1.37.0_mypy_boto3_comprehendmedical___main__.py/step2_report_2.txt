  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect if `--version` is present, then prints version info; otherwise, it prints package info.\n   - All outputs are hardcoded strings or version numbers.\n   - No user input processing beyond argument checking.\n   - No network activity, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation.\n   - No credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code's purpose as informational CLI output.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The analysis in each report is detailed and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified since there's no evident security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No reason to adjust scores upward.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations or contain hidden malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Overall Estimation:**\n   - The code is a simple, safe CLI utility.\n   - The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code poses no security risks and is safe for use.",
