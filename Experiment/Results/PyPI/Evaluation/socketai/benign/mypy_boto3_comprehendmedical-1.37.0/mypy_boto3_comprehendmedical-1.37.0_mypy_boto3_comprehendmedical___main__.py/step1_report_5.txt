  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package version and details for boto3 ComprehendMedical.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Output to sys.stdout (printing info and version). No data sinks for untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version(), else calls print_info(). Data flows from sys.argv into control logic, then to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static information. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line input. It reads from sys.argv but only compares for a specific string '--version'. It writes static data to stdout. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The code's structure is clear and conventional. No suspicious behaviors or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility intended to display package info and version. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
