  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-comprehendmedical' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the filesystem to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink identified; no data is transmitted or written based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup() without external input or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a local markdown file for the description. It uses standard library modules and a well-known packaging library. No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved. There are no indications of code injection, malicious network activity, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup file with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely reads a local file and defines package metadata for distribution. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
