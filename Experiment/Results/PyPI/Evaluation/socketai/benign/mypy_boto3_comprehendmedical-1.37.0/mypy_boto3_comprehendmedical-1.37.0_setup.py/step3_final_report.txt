  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-comprehendmedical, used to package and distribute the Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reading (README.md) into package description; static metadata into setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input. It reads a local file for description and specifies dependencies explicitly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
