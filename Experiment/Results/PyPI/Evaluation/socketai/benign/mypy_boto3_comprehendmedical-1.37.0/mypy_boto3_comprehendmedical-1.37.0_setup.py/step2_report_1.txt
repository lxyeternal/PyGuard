  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the script as a straightforward, static setup configuration for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input are involved.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is a common practice.\n- The dependencies are explicitly specified and safe.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The license header mentions the year 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.\n- The code structure follows standard packaging practices.\n\n**Assessment of Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, citing no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior. This aligns with the code's static, non-executing nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is accurate given the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't pose a security risk.\n- No report suggests any hidden code, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the code review and the detailed reports, the package setup script is benign, standard, and free of security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThe reports are consistent with my analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe setup script is a typical, safe package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. All scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security concerns.",
