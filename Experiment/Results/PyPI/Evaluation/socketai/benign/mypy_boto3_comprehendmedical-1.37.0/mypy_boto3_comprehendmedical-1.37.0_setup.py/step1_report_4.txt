  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-comprehendmedical package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md for long_description, imports setup from setuptools, and static string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data and file reads only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static configuration data flows into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads the README.md file for description, and defines package setup parameters. It uses static values for version, author info, URLs, and dependencies, with no dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing. No code injections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The setup process appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
