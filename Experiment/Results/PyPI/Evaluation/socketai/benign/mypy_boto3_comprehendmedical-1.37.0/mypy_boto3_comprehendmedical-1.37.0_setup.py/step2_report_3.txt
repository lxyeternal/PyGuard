  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- It imports only standard modules (`pathlib`) and `setuptools`.\n- All package metadata, dependencies, and data are static.\n- No user input, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident.\n- The license date is future-dated (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code appears clean, straightforward, and standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **No logical flaws or mistakes** are apparent. The code functions as intended for a setup script.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  **No.** There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  **No.** The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Security risks:\n\n- **Any security risks?**  \n  **No.** Static configuration with no external data or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Specific issues in reports:\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with confidence scores of 1.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1-5     | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a typical, well-formed setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0            |\n\nThe code is safe, clean, and standard for its purpose.",
