{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-comprehendmedical' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports from pathlib and setuptools; reads environment variables indirectly via setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; package data and dependencies are specified statically.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION; uses this variable in setup() without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward package setup, importing necessary modules, reading a markdown file for description, and calling setup() with static metadata. All inputs and outputs are static, and no dynamic or external untrusted data is processed or transmitted. There are no suspicious code patterns, no external network interactions, and no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It securely and properly defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
