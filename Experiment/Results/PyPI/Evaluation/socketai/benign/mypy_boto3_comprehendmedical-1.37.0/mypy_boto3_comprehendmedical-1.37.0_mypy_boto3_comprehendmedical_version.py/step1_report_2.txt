  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Assignment of a static string to __version__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; only a version string is defined.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for the module with a copyright notice. It is a straightforward declaration with no dynamic or malicious elements. There are no input/output operations, external calls, or code that could be exploited. The copyright year appears inconsistent with the version number, but that is a content issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
