  "purpose": "Define and provide the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded version string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded version string and a copyright notice; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static string '1.37.0' to the variable __version__, with a comment indicating the source of truth for versioning and a copyright notice. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data flows, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present. The code appears to be a standard version declaration commonly found in Python modules, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security threat and is typical in Python package metadata.",
