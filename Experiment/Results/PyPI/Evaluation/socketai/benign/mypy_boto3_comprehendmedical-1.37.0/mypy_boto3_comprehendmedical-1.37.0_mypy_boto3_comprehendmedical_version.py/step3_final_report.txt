  "purpose": "Define the version of the package.",

  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), which is benign and likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version string assignment with a copyright notice. No dynamic behavior, input/output, external dependencies, or obfuscation are present. The only unusual aspect is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The only minor anomaly (future year) is not a security concern.",
