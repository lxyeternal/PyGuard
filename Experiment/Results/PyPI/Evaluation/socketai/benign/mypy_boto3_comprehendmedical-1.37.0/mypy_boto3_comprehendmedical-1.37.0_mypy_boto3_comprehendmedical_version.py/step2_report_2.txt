  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code?**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__` and contains a copyright statement. There are no input/output operations, no external data flows, no code execution, and no obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n   The reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard for version declaration. They note the future year in the copyright statement but dismiss it as non-malicious.  \n   **No significant errors or flaws are apparent.**\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` = 0, `securityRisk` = 0, and `obfuscated` = 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   **Recommendation:** Scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree there's no malicious activity or security risk, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.  \n   **Confirmed:** risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.  \n   **No issues here.**\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.  \n   **No unwarranted assumptions detected.**\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not imply malicious intent or security concern.\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration, common in open source packages.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security issues or malicious activity.**",
