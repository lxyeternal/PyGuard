  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code contains only a static string assignment and a copyright notice.\n   - No input/output, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Anomalies and Concerns:**\n   - The only noted anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement.\n   - This is likely a placeholder or outdated metadata, not malicious.\n\n3. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code is benign, with no data flow, no external dependencies, and no malicious code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The minimal anomaly (future year) does not impact security assessment.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
