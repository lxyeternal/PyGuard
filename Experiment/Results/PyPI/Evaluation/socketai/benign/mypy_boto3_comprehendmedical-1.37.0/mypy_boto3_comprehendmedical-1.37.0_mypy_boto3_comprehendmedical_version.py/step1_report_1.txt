  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = '1.37.0'",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or data processing occurs beyond assigning a constant string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which could suggest outdated or placeholder metadata, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that sets a version string and includes a copyright statement. It does not read any external input, process data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The copyright year is in the future, which might be unusual but does not imply malicious intent. The code structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious.",
