  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for managing environment variables (MYPYPATH and PYTHONPATH) by appending directories or subdirectories to these variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.environ and command-line arguments for directory paths",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables using os.environ[env_variable]",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> get_env_data() -> append functions -> set_env_data() -> environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of environment variables and os.walk is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Logging is at INFO level; warnings are only informational.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions for managing environment variables related to Python type checking (MYPYPATH) and module search paths (PYTHONPATH). The functions validate directory existence, manipulate environment variable strings, and update environment variables accordingly. The command-line interface wraps these functions for easy usage. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is observed. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or code injection vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a legitimate helper tool for development workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for environment variable management without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks and is safe to use from a security perspective.",
