  "purpose": "Utility functions and CLI commands for appending directories or subdirectories to environment variables MYPYPATH and PYTHONPATH, primarily for development workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via get_env_data; reads directory paths from function arguments; uses os.walk to list subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables using set_env_data, which modifies os.environ.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables, validates directory existence, appends directories/subdirs, and updates environment variables accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. No external network activity or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable management with standard libraries, validating directories before modification. It offers CLI commands for ease of use. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is straightforward, and the environment variable manipulations are typical for development tools. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing environment variables, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate. It poses minimal security risk and is safe for use in trusted environments.",
