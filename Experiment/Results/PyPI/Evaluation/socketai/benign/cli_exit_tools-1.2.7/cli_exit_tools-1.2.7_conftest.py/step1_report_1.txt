{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to configure pytest behavior by adding custom command-line arguments during the test setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'args' list parameter, which contains command-line arguments passed to pytest.",
  "sinks": "The 'args' list is modified to include additional arguments, which could influence pytest's execution.",
  "flows": "The code takes existing command-line args (source) and modifies them in place by adding new args, potentially influencing test behavior (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and typing, defines an empty list 'collect_ignore' (possibly for pytest configuration). It defines a function to modify pytest startup arguments by appending additional arguments (currently empty). The code appears to customize pytest behavior, possibly for test collection or configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious commands, or backdoors. The function's purpose is benign and aligns with standard testing setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration script intended to add custom arguments during test initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate testing configuration purposes.",
