{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the pytest testing framework by modifying the initial configuration and argument list.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'args' list passed to 'pytest_load_initial_conftests' which contains command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'args' list directly, which influences how pytest runs, but there are no direct sinks leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source is 'args' input; the flow involves adding optional pytest arguments and updating the 'args' list before pytest processes them.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code performs a standard argument handling pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list to ignore certain tests and a function to load initial pytest configuration. The function attempts to add additional pytest arguments (currently empty) to the 'args' list by removing duplicates. There is no suspicious or malicious activity, and the logic appears to be standard pytest customization. No external data is read, and no external connections are made. The code is straightforward and follows expected patterns for pytest plugin development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest configuration snippet used to modify test execution parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
