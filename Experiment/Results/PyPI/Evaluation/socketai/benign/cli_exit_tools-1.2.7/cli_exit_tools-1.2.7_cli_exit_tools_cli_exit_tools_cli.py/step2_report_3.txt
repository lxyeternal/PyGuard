  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The script is a CLI utility that sets up signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM, with platform-specific considerations (Windows and Linux).\n- It imports configuration modules (__init__conf__) and exit tools (cli_exit_tools), with fallback import strategies.\n- It defines custom exceptions for signal handling (SigIntError, SigTermError).\n- Signal handlers raise these exceptions, enabling graceful shutdown.\n- It provides a CLI command \"info\" that displays configuration info.\n- The main block initializes signal handlers and runs the CLI, catching exceptions and cleaning up streams.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured CLI utility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes setting up signal handlers and CLI commands for a Python app.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, standard practices, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, CLI with signal handling, platform-specific imports.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No red flags.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI with signal handling, platform detection.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, safe exception handling, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI setup, platform-specific signal management.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, well-structured, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI with signal handling, info display.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. This code is purely for signal handling and CLI setup; no malicious behavior or code injection is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose, the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is the use of signal handling which, if misused, could cause abrupt termination, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky. The reports assign a low risk (~0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the code as standard CLI setup with platform-specific signal handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low; standard system signal handling, no secrets or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.**",
