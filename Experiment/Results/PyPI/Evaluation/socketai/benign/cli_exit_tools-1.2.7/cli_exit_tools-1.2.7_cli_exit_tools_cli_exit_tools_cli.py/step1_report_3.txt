{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for system info and signal handling, with platform-specific signal management and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Reads platform info from 'platform.system()', imports from local modules '__init__conf__' and 'cli_exit_tools', and reads signals from 'signal' and 'win32api' on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Raises custom exceptions on signal receipt, calls external module functions (__init__conf__.print_info()), and exits via sys.exit() with codes from 'cli_exit_tools.get_system_exit_code()'.",
  "flows": "Platform info determines signal handling setup; signal handlers raise exceptions; CLI commands invoke info functions; main execution sets handlers and runs CLI, handling exceptions with external modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional imports, standard signal setup, and exception raising on signals are normal; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. No malicious code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a CLI application with platform-specific signal handling and error management. It uses external modules for info display and exception handling, which are imported dynamically and with fallback. Signal handlers raise custom exceptions to allow clean shutdowns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activities, or obfuscated code are present. The structure is standard for CLI tools; the only notable aspect is cross-platform signal management, which is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for system info and signal handling without malicious intent. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks were found. It follows good practices for platform-specific behavior and exception handling.",
