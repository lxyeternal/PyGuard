{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interface (CLI) functionality with signal handling and platform-specific considerations, mainly for clean termination and informational output.",
  "sources": "Imports system modules (platform, signal, sys), dynamic import of configuration and tools, environment detection via platform.system().",
  "sinks": "Uses signal handlers to raise custom exceptions, calls external libraries like win32api (on Windows), and outputs info via print functions.",
  "flows": "Signal handling functions intercept SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, raising custom exceptions; main entry point sets handlers and runs CLI commands, which invoke info functions or exit handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no data leakage points. The only dynamic element is environment detection and conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up signal handlers for clean shutdown across different platforms, conditionally imports platform-specific modules, and defines CLI commands using click. It imports external modules safely with try-except blocks, ensuring graceful fallback if modules are missing. The signal handlers raise custom exceptions, which are caught in main to handle cleanup. No untrusted data sources or insecure code paths are identified. No hidden backdoors or malicious functions are present. The structure is straightforward and adheres to best practices for CLI tools with signal management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured CLI application with platform-specific signal handling and no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as expected for command-line utilities without introducing vulnerabilities.",
