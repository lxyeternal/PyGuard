  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI with signal handling, platform detection, and info display. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for CLI apps with signal handling. The low risk score seems appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe platform detection, optional imports, and standard signal handling. No suspicious code or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The low risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on platform-specific signal management, safe external module usage, and no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough; the code appears legitimate and safe.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Describes a standard CLI with signal handling, platform detection, and safe external module imports. No malicious activity or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 (noted as 0).  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent; no security issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others—signal handling, platform detection, safe practices, no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious indicators.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.  \n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in signal handling or platform detection, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, well-structured, and transparent.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, considering the code's purpose and implementation; no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility with platform-specific signal handling. No indicators of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
