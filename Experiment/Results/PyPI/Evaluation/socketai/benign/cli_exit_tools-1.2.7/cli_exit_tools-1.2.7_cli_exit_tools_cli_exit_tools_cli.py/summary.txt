  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI utility for system info and signal handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk typical for such utilities."
