  "purpose": "Setup platform-specific signal handlers and CLI commands for system info and graceful shutdown.",
  "sources": "Platform detection, signal module, external configuration and CLI modules, optional win32api import.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions in signal handlers, calling configuration print functions, CLI command execution.",
  "flows": "Signal triggers -> handler raises exception -> CLI command or info function executes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard platform detection, safe import strategies, and signal handling for CLI applications. Signal handlers raise custom exceptions for clean shutdowns. External modules are imported with error handling, and CLI commands are defined with 'click'. No network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI utility for system info and signal handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk typical for such utilities.",
