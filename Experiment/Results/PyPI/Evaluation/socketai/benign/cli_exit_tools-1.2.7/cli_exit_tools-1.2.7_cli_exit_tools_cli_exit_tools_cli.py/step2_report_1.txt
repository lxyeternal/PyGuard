  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up signal handlers and CLI commands, no suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature. The code raises exceptions on signals but doesn't perform any malicious activity.\n- **Potential issues:** No actual issues found. Signal handling and CLI setup are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on platform detection, safe exception handling, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, consistent with the code.\n- **Potential issues:** No suspicious behavior or code obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on platform detection, optional import of win32api, and safe signal handling.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Potential issues:** No malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights cross-platform signal handling, safe imports, and standard CLI setup.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0, or 0.1 at most. The report's assigned 0.0 for malware and 0 for security risk is appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard CLI and signal handling, no malicious code.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, consistent.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to signal handling, which is standard.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to signal handling, which is common in CLI tools)\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for system info and graceful shutdown, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The existing scores are appropriate, and I would maintain or slightly lower the security risk score to 0.1 for conservativeness.",
