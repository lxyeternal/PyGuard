{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for exception handling, including retrieving system-specific exit codes and printing detailed exception messages with optional traceback information.",
  "sources": "Reads exception objects and their attributes such as 'winerror', 'stdout', and 'stderr'. It also reads from sys.exc_info() and sys.builtin_module_names.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted exception messages, traceback details, and stdout/stderr contents to specified streams (default sys.stderr).",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> functions access exception attributes -> message and traceback info are formatted and printed to output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of sys.exc_info() and dynamic attribute access is standard for exception handling; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles exception reporting and system exit code determination. It reads exception details, potentially outputs stdout/stderr data if present, and can include traceback info. No signs of data leakage, network activity, or code injection are evident. All functions perform standard logging or system information retrieval, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for exception handling and logging. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities. The code is straightforward and intended for debugging or error reporting.",
