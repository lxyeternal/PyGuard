{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling exceptions, including extracting exit codes, printing exception messages, and flushing output streams.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception objects (e.g., exc, exc_info), sys.exc_info(), and optional stream inputs (like sys.stdout or sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "Printing to sys.stderr or provided streams; decoding bytes for display; potentially exposing exception details.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are examined for attributes; exception information and traceback are formatted and printed; output streams are flushed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The functions process and display exception info, which is standard debugging behavior. No suspicious network activity, file modifications, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles exception processing and output formatting in a typical manner, providing traceback details and exception messages with optional length truncation. It cautiously checks for attributes like stdout and stderr in exception objects before printing, which is standard for debugging or logging purposes. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are evident. All operations are typical exception handling routines with no external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception handling utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely formats and prints exception details, which is common in debugging or logging contexts. There are no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware behaviors.",
