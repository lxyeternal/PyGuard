  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of debugging utilities for exception handling and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight risk score reflects the potential for leaking sensitive info during debugging, but this is typical and not malicious."
