{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling exceptions, printing exception messages with optional traceback, and converting exceptions to system exit codes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from exception objects (exc_info), exception attributes (stdout, stderr), and sys.exc_info().",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to provided stream (stdout or stderr) via print statements, and potentially logs exception details.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> functions retrieve exception info -> output is formatted/truncated and printed to stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code includes detailed exception handling, which is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The only potential concern is extensive exception detail printing, but it is intended for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers exception handling utilities: get_system_exit_code converts exceptions to exit codes, print_exception_message displays exception info with optional traceback and stream attributes, and _print_output prints stdout/stderr if present. These functions use standard exception attributes and sys modules. No network activity, file manipulation, or suspicious behavior detected. No malicious or sabotage code present. The code appears to be a legitimate debugging and utility script for exception handling with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for exception management and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It’s designed for debugging purposes, with no malicious intent evident.",
