  "purpose": "Utility functions for exception handling, retrieving system exit codes, printing exception messages, and flushing output streams, primarily for debugging and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Exception objects' attributes such as 'winerror', 'stdout', 'stderr'; sys.exc_info() for current exception; sys.builtin_module_names for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "Printing exception messages and traceback info to streams; decoding exception bytes; potential leakage of sensitive exception data during debugging.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> get_system_exit_code inspects exception attributes -> print_exception_message formats and outputs exception info and traceback -> _print_output outputs stdout/stderr attributes -> flush_streams ensures output is written promptly.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network/file operations detected. Use of exception attributes is standard but could expose sensitive data if exceptions carry such info.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard debugging utilities for exception handling, including extracting exit codes, printing exception info with optional traceback, and flushing output streams. It accesses exception attributes like 'winerror', 'stdout', and 'stderr', which are typical in subprocess or system error exceptions. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The potential risk lies in exposing sensitive exception data during debugging, but this is a common practice and not malicious. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and uses standard Python exception handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of debugging utilities for exception handling and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight risk score reflects the potential for leaking sensitive info during debugging, but this is typical and not malicious.",
