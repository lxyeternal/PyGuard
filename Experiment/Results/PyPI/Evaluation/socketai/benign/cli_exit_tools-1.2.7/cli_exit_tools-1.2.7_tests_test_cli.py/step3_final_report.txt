  "purpose": "To execute a specific CLI script with various command-line arguments for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The function call_cli_command constructs the command string from sys.executable, a script path, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes the constructed command, which could lead to command injection if commandline_args are untrusted.",
  "flows": "The command string flows from construction in call_cli_command to execution via subprocess.run(), with commandline_args passing from function input to the shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True with string concatenation, which is risky if inputs are untrusted; however, in current tests, arguments are fixed and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs command strings by concatenating the Python executable, script path, and command-line arguments, then executes them with subprocess.run() using shell=True. The test functions invoke commands with static arguments, minimizing immediate risk. The primary concern is the pattern of using shell=True with string commands, which can be exploited if commandline_args are influenced externally. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.2-0.4), reflecting the potential danger if inputs are untrusted. The code is straightforward and controlled, but the pattern should be avoided in production or with untrusted inputs. Overall, the code is benign in its current form, with a known security anti-pattern that warrants caution if modified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled CLI testing utility that executes commands via subprocess with a pattern that could be risky if inputs are untrusted. No malicious activity is detected, and the current scores are appropriate. To improve security, avoid using shell=True or sanitize inputs when accepting external data.",
