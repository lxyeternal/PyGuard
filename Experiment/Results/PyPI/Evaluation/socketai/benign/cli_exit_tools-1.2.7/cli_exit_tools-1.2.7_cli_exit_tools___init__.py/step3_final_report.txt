  "purpose": "Detect test environment and add path for local testing",
  "sources": "is_testenv_active() and add_path_to_syspath() functions, __file__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external data handling",
  "flows": "is_testenv_active() determines environment; if true, add_path_to_syspath(__file__) modifies sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Conditional sys.path modification based on environment detection; relies on external functions whose implementations are unknown",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and conditional path modification, which is a common pattern in test setups. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. External functions are assumed safe but their implementations are unknown. The pattern is standard for package initialization, with no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and clear, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment setup script for testing, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risk. The use of environment detection and path modification is standard, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
