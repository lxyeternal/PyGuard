  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment setup script for testing, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risk. The use of environment detection and path modification is standard, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
