  "purpose": "Initialize module by detecting test environment and setting up paths, then import configuration and tools.",
  "sources": "Import statement for lib_detect_testenv, call to is_testenv_active(), and add_path_to_syspath(__file__).",
  "sinks": "add_path_to_syspath(__file__), and the subsequent imports from local modules.",
  "flows": "import lib_detect_testenv -> call is_testenv_active() -> conditional add_path_to_syspath(__file__) -> import local modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions and conditional path modification; no obvious anomalies or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module to detect test environment status, then conditionally modifies sys.path to include the current file directory. It subsequently imports local modules and configuration data. The pattern is typical for modular Python projects. No indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic appears to be solely for environment setup and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup snippet for a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident. The structure and purpose suggest legitimate initialization code.",
