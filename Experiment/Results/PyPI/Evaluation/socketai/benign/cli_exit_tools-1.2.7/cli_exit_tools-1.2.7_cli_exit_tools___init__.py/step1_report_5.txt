  "purpose": "Initialize the package environment, detect test environment, and set up import paths accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import of 'lib_detect_testenv' module, call to 'is_testenv_active()', and 'add_path_to_syspath()' function; standard __init__ configuration imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'add_path_to_syspath(__file__)' call, which modifies sys.path; import statements for configuration data.",
  "flows": "Import of 'lib_detect_testenv' -> call to 'is_testenv_active()' -> conditional 'add_path_to_syspath(__file__)' -> import of various modules and configuration attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and path modification based on environment detection; reliance on external test environment detection function. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code evident. The pattern is typical for environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module designed for test environment detection. If active, it modifies sys.path dynamically, which could be used for testing or malicious purposes. However, this pattern is common in test setups. The rest of the code loads configuration attributes. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The functions involved are typical for environment setup and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for environment detection and setup, with standard import patterns. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent. The dynamic path modification is conditional and used for test environment handling, which is common in development workflows.",
