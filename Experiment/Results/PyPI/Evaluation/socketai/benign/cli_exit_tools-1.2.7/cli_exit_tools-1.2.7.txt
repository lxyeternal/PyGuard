The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight risk score reflects the potential for leaking sensitive info during debugging, but this is typical and not malicious."

The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk typical for such utilities."
