  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines package metadata variables (name, title, version, url, author, email, shell_command).\n- It includes a single function `print_info()` that outputs static, hardcoded package information.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and serves informational purposes. There are no malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports consistently conclude that the code is safe and benign. Their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which is justified.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  All are high (1 or 1.0), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and serves only informational purposes.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that aren't supported by the code.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is simple, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only outputs package info, with no external inputs or side effects.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
