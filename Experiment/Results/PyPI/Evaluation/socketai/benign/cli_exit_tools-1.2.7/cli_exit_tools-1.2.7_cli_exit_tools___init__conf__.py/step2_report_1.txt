  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and only outputs package metadata.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code's purpose appears purely informational.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and align with the code's simplicity.\n- No anomalies, flaws, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only possible concern could be the use of print statements, but in this context, it's benign.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely informational, there is no justification for higher scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, static informational script with no malicious or risky behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I concur with the provided scores and conclusions.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n- No further action is required.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual behavior.",
