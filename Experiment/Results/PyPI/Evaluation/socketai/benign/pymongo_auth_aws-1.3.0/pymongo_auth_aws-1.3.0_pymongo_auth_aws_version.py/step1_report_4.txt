  "flows": "There are no data flows, input sources, or untrusted data handling in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version assignment, with no suspicious or unusual behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a single assignment of a version string. No executable logic, input handling, or data transmission is present. The presence of license text and version declaration is typical for open-source packages and does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard licensing and version declaration fragment, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
