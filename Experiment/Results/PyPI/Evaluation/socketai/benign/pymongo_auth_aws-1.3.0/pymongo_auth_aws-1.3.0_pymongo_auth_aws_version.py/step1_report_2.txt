  "purpose": "This code primarily contains license information, versioning, and licensing statements for a software package.",
  "sources": "The license comments and version variable (__version__ = \"1.3.0\")",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data pathways in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code consists solely of license comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license text, licensing terms, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data handling, network calls, or any executable code that could pose security risks. The absence of code logic or data manipulation indicates it is purely metadata. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable use, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This fragment is harmless and contains only licensing information and a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical header comment with a version declaration.",
