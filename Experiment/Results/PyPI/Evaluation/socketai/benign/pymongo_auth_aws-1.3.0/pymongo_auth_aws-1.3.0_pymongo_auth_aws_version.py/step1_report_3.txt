  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be part of a package's license and version information, likely a header for a larger Python module or package related to MongoDB.",
  "sources": "The only source of data here is the version string '__version__' assigned with a static value '1.3.0'. No input or external data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where data flows into or out of the system, nor are there any untrusted data handling or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only assigns a static version string and contains licensing comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code consists solely of comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely informational, including licensing details, copyright, and versioning. There are no executable actions, no input/output handling, and no dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard header used in open-source projects, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard license header, and version declaration. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. It is typical boilerplate code for an open-source Python package.",
