{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version indicator for an open-source Python package, containing only comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sources": "The version assignment '__version__ = \"1.3.0\"' is the only executable data source; no input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code contains no functions or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple license header with a version string, containing no executable logic, network calls, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard open-source license header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately reflect this, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
