  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for pymongo-auth-aws error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definition is static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data flow.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; purely a class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward Python class defining a custom exception inheriting from Exception, with only licensing comments and a docstring. It contains no input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely error handling within the pymongo-auth-aws package, with no external data handling or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
