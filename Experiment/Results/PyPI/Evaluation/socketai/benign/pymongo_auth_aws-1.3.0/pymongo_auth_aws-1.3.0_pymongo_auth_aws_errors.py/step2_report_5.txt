  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no input reading, data processing, external communication, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python libraries.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports mention any obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code contains only licensing comments and a simple class with a docstring, consistent across all reports.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are apparent.\n   - The class name `PyMongoAuthAwsError` is descriptive and appropriate for error handling related to the pymongo-auth-aws package.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The high confidence (1) across all reports is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and accurate, there is no need to adjust scores.\n   - The reports do not raise any concerns about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The code is a typical exception class definition, common in Python packages.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's apparent simplicity.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard, and free from security issues or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
