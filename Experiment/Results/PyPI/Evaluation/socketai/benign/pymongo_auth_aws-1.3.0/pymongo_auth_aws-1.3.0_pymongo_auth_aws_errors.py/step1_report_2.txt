  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definition with no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a single exception class definition inheriting from Exception. It does not perform any input, output, or data manipulation. There are no hidden, obfuscated, or malicious behaviors present. It appears to be a standard, minimal implementation for custom exceptions in a library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, standard class definition for custom exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
