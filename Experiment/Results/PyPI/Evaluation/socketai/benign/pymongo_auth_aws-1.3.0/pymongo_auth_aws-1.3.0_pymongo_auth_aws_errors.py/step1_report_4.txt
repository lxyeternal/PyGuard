  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pymongo-auth-aws library errors.",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading or external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of licensing comments and a single class definition for an exception, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It serves as a base exception for the library and does not contain any code that reads input, processes data, or performs external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard class definition used for error handling in a specific library. It shows no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
