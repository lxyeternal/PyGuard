  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pymongo-auth-aws package errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It contains no input reading, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. It adheres to licensing standards and contains no obfuscated or malicious code. The content is typical for a Python module defining exceptions and has no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
