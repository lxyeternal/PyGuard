  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - It contains only licensing comments and a single class with a docstring.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple exception class with no suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a benign exception class with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful operations.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and transparency.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign exception class definition.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conclude no security issues.\n- The scores are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious or suspicious elements.",
