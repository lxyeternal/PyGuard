  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definition",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely a class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception class definition",
  "analysis": "The code provides a basic custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It contains license comments and a class definition with a docstring. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard exception class for error handling in a Python package, specifically related to pymongo authentication with AWS.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
