  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; environment setup for debugging.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional insertion of an empty string into sys.path, affecting module search order.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and faulthandler, then prepends an empty string to sys.path, causing Python to include the current directory at the start of module search paths. This is typically used to prioritize local modules or for debugging purposes. Enabling faulthandler is a standard debugging practice. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The sys.path modification is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could be exploited if malicious modules are present in the current directory, but there is no evidence of such activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging setup with an unconventional sys.path modification that could influence module loading but does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit malware or obfuscation.",
