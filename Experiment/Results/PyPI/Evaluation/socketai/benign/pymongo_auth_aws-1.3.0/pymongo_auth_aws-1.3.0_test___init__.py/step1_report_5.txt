  "purpose": "Initialize the environment by enabling fault handler for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements and modification of sys.path",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only environment setup",
  "anomalies": "Modification of sys.path to prepend an empty string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and faulthandler modules. It modifies sys.path by inserting an empty string at the beginning, which typically resets or clears the module search path, possibly to ensure no interference from other directories. Enabling faulthandler helps dump traceback info on faults. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; the code appears to be for debugging or environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script primarily for debugging purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
