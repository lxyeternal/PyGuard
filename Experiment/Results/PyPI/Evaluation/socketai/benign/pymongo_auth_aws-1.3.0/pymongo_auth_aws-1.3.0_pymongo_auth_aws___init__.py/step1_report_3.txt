  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data is processed or executed; purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is limited to import statements with licensing comments. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments and import statements for modules handling AWS credentials and errors related to MongoDB authentication. It does not process or execute any data, nor does it contain any suspicious or malicious logic. The import statements are standard and do not pose security concerns. The licensing comments indicate legal compliance but do not affect security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is safe, consisting solely of import statements and licensing comments. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
