  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments and import statements for AWS credentials, error handling, and version info. No executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a library module and shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard structure support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import section of an AWS authentication library for MongoDB. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
