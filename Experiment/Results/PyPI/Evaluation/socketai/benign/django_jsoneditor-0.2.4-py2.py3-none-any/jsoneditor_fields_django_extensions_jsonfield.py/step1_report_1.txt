  "purpose": "Define custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with validation and a specialized widget.",
  "sources": "Import statements for JSON, Django forms, and external JSON editor widget; methods that process and validate JSON data.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' call for decoding JSON strings; potential exceptions raised during JSON decoding.",
  "flows": "Input JSON string -> json.loads parsing -> ValidationError on failure -> Conversion in to_python method -> Return of processed value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of external JSON editor widget is standard. Exception handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends Django's JSONField to include custom form representation and validation. It ensures JSON strings are validated via json.loads and raises ValidationError on decode failures. The JSONEditor widget is imported from an external library but used as a widget class, which appears legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or obfuscated code. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. Exception handling is correct, and no unsafe code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured extension of Django's JSON handling capabilities with proper validation and widget customization. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
