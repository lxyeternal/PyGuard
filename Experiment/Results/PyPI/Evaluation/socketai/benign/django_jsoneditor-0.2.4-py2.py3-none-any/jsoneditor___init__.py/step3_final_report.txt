  "purpose": "This code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. It contains no input/output, data processing, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security threats or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
