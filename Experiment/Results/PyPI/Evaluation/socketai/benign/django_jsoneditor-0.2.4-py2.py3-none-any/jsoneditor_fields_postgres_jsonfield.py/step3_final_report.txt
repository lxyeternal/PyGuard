  "purpose": "Customize Django PostgreSQL JSON fields to enforce the use of a specific JSON editor widget in forms and models.",
  "sources": "Django's PostgreSQL JSONField and form classes, and the JSONEditor widget imported from jsoneditor.forms.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; code only sets widget attributes and overrides methods for UI customization.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and method overrides enforce widget usage; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses to enforce a specific widget for JSON input in Django forms and models. It involves straightforward class inheritance and method overriding, with no external data handling, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The widget used is a third-party component but is employed solely for UI purposes. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's intent appears to be improving user experience for JSON editing, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely UI customization for JSON fields in Django, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall evaluation confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
