{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django form and model fields to use a JSON editor widget for JSON data handling in forms and models.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.postgres.fields, django.contrib.postgres.forms, and jsoneditor.forms; use of class constructors and method calls for formfield.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly; primarily configuring form fields and widgets.",
  "flows": "Initialization of custom form and model fields, setting widget attributes, and returning configured form fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code simply customizes field and widget behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django PostgreSQL JSON fields and form classes, then defines custom subclasses that set a JSON editor widget for forms and enforce widget usage in form fields. There are no external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is straightforward and focused on UI customization. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely customizes Django form and model JSON fields to use a JSON editor widget without introducing security risks or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign implementation intended for user-friendly JSON data editing.",
