{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django model and form fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django's PostgreSQL fields, forms, and a third-party JSON editor.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code primarily defines classes and widget assignment.",
  "flows": "Class initialization and method calls passing data, but no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes Django model and form fields for JSON data, forcing a specific widget (JSONEditor) in the form field class. The methods override standard behavior to set the widget explicitly and configure form class defaults. No data input/output, environment variable use, or external communication present. The code simply manipulates class attributes and method parameters for form customization without involving any data flow from untrusted sources or performing unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward customization of Django form/model fields for JSON handling with a third-party widget. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected, and it doesn't introduce security risks beyond standard form field definitions.",
