{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django model and form fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget.",
  "sources": "Import statements from Django and jsoneditor libraries; class initializations and method overrides.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no external network or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly sets up class inheritance and widget assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Widget assignment is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing Django PostgreSQL JSONField and its form counterpart to enforce a specific widget (JSONEditor) for JSON input in forms. It overrides the __init__ method to set the widget explicitly, preventing override, and customizes the formfield method to default to this widget. There are no external data sources, network operations, or malicious patterns present. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard customization of Django form and model fields to enforce a specific JSON editing widget. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks.",
