  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django PostgreSQL fields, Django forms, and a JSON editor widget.",
  "sinks": "Uses the JSONEditor widget in form fields.",
  "flows": "The JSONFormField class initializes with the widget set to JSONEditor, and JSONField uses formfield() to assign JSONFormField as the form class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The widget assignment is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing Django PostgreSQL JSON fields to enforce using a custom JSONEditor widget for form inputs. The JSONFormField class sets the widget attribute and ensures it is used during form field initialization. The JSONField class overrides formfield() to set the default form class to JSONFormField, promoting consistent widget use. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard customization for UI purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension for customizing JSON data handling in Django forms with a specific widget. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
