  "purpose": "Define custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget for editing.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.postgres.fields, django.contrib.postgres.forms, and jsoneditor.forms; uses these in class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; formfield method creates form instances, but does not process external data directly.",
  "flows": "Initialization of JSONFormField with a custom widget, then JSONField uses this form field in its formfield method; data flows from form definitions to form rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; widget override is explicitly enforced, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: JSONFormField, which enforces the use of JSONEditor widget for JSON input, and JSONField, which specifies the form_class for Django model forms. Both classes extend Django's PostgreSQL JSON field classes. The code does not process or evaluate data, does not execute code dynamically, or include external network calls. It simply customizes form fields for JSON data handling with a specific widget. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears to be a straightforward customization for UI purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard customization of Django model and form fields for JSON data, enforcing a specific widget. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
