  "purpose": "Define a Django form widget for JSON editing with customizable JS and CSS assets",
  "sources": "Settings for JS and CSS assets, input data for rendering, JSON data for value",
  "sinks": "Rendering output including JSON-encoded data, HTML markup with attributes",
  "flows": "Input data (value, jsonschema, options) -> JSON serialization -> HTML rendering with attributes and JS assets",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports for Python 2/3 compatibility, dynamic asset paths from settings, no explicit security checks, no sanitization of external data beyond JSON encoding",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django widget for JSON editing, loading JS and CSS assets dynamically from settings, with compatibility code for Python 2 and 3. During rendering, it serializes input data as JSON, incorporating optional schema and options. It constructs HTML attributes and appends a div container. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present. The dynamic inclusion of assets and JSON data is standard practice; however, there is no input sanitization beyond JSON encoding, which is typical for this context but could pose issues if untrusted data is injected into the widget's attributes. Overall, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django widget implementation with dynamic asset inclusion and JSON serialization. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a normal component for JSON editing in Django admin, with no backdoors or malicious logic.",
