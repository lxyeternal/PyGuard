  "purpose": "Define a Django form widget (JSONEditor) for editing JSON data with integrated JavaScript and CSS assets, supporting customization and schema validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django framework, settings, and JSON data in the render method.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() calls on self.jsonschema, self.init_options, self.ace_options, and value; use of mark_safe() to insert HTML; setting of HTML attributes.",
  "flows": "Data read from instance attributes (jsonschema, init_options, ace_options, value), converted to JSON or string, then injected into HTML attributes and rendered output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'django.forms.util' import with fallback; handling of Python 2/3 compatibility with 'unicode' and 'basestring'; dynamic inclusion of JavaScript and CSS assets via settings; HTML string concatenation with potential formatting issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django widget for editing JSON with customizable assets. It includes compatibility handling for different Python versions and Django versions. The JSON data is serialized with json.dumps(), which is standard. Assets are included based on Django settings, allowing flexibility. The use of mark_safe() ensures the HTML is rendered correctly. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to perform its intended function securely, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django widget implementation with configurable assets. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its design is consistent with typical Django practices for custom form widgets, and no malicious signals are present.",
