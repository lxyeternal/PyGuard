  "purpose": "Define a Django form widget for a JSON editor with customizable JavaScript and CSS assets.",
  "sources": "Settings values for JS/CSS files, input data in the render method, self.jsonschema, self.init_options, self.ace_options, self.encoder, and the value parameter in render.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization of widget configuration, rendering HTML output, including dynamic attributes and script inclusion.",
  "flows": "Data from self.jsonschema, self.init_options, self.ace_options, and self.encoder flow into JSON-encoded attributes; input value is JSON serialized if not string; HTML is generated with embedded attributes and static asset references.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version parsing and conditional attribute building for compatibility, but no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django widget class for a JSON editor, handling different Django versions and conditional settings for assets. It serializes configuration options into data attributes and generates HTML with embedded scripts and styles. It does not process untrusted user input in a way that leads to code injection or data leaks. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present. Usage of settings for assets is typical and safe, assuming proper configuration. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls. Overall, it appears to be a standard widget implementation with configurable assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django form widget for a JSON editor with configurable assets. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe with a low malware score and minimal security concerns.",
