  "purpose": "Define a custom Django form widget (JSONEditor) that integrates a JSON editing interface with customizable JavaScript and CSS assets.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings (settings.JSON_EDITOR_JS, settings.JSON_EDITOR_CSS, etc.), user-provided kwargs (jsonschema, init_options, ace_options, encoder), and input value for rendering.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps to serialize data, which is safe; constructs HTML markup with Django's build_attrs and flatatt, which are standard. No untrusted data is directly executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data (value, kwargs, settings) is serialized with json.dumps, then embedded into HTML attributes. The render method combines these into HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL patterns, or obfuscated code. The code dynamically includes assets based on settings, which is typical in Django widgets. No unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django widget for JSON editing, with asset inclusion and rendering logic that safely serializes user data and configuration into HTML attributes. Compatibility code for different Django versions is standard. No malicious code or suspicious behavior detected. No code injection, backdoors, or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django widget implementation for JSON editing, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
