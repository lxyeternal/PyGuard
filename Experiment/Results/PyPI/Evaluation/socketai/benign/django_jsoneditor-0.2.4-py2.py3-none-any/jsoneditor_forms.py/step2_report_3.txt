  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a Django widget for JSON editing, with assets and rendering logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Uses deprecated import (`django.forms.util`) with fallback, but this is common in legacy code. Compatibility handling for Python 2/3 is present but outdated; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9. These seem reasonable; the widget is standard, with low security risk.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk accounts for potential misconfiguration or asset inclusion issues, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches; a Django widget for JSON editing with asset inclusion.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic; standard use of json.dumps and Django's build_attrs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1. The risk score is high, but since the code is standard and safe, this seems overstated.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present; the code does not perform any network activity or execute untrusted code.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score should be lowered to around 0.1 or 0.2, aligning with the minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code; similar widget with dynamic assets.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic; standard data serialization and HTML rendering.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9. The high risk score seems excessive given the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no external network calls.\n\n**Recommendation:** Lower the risk score to around 0.1–0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with the code; widget for JSON editing.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code; standard handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9. Again, the risk score appears inflated.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce risk score to approximately 0.1–0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a standard Django widget.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic; asset inclusion and JSON serialization are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9. The high risk score seems unjustified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:** Lower risk score to about 0.1–0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** The high risk scores (0.9) seem unjustified. The code is a standard Django widget that serializes data into HTML attributes and includes assets dynamically based on settings. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, and no code injection mechanisms.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a more appropriate score would be around **0.1** to **0.2** for each, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging potential misconfiguration or asset inclusion issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood Django widget for JSON editing.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The high risk scores are overstated; they should be lowered to reflect the code's benign nature.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:** For all reports, set **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**, and **securityRisk=0.1–0.2**.",
