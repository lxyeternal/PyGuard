  "purpose": "A Django widget for JSON editing that dynamically includes assets, handles Python 2/3 compatibility, and serializes configuration data into HTML attributes for client-side rendering.",
  "sources": "Settings variables for asset URLs, input data passed to render method, JSON serialization of jsonschema, init_options, and ace_options.",
  "sinks": "HTML attributes embedding JSON data, JavaScript assets for client-side JSON editor initialization.",
  "flows": "Configuration data from Python variables serialized via json.dumps() into HTML attributes, then used by client-side scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated import for flatatt with fallback, extensive compatibility code for Python 2/3, dynamic asset URLs from settings, no sanitization beyond json.dumps().",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django widget for JSON editing, including assets dynamically based on settings, handling Python 2/3 compatibility, and serializing configuration data into HTML attributes. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The use of json.dumps() for data serialization is safe, and mark_safe() is used appropriately. The fallback import for flatatt and compatibility code are common practices, though slightly outdated. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the handling of untrusted data passed into jsonschema, init_options, or ace_options, but this is outside the widget's scope. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Django widget for JSON editing with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is low (around 0.1-0.2), and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The existing assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
