  "purpose": "Define a Django form widget for JSON editing with embedded scripts and styles.",
  "sources": "Reads settings variables for JS and CSS assets; reads 'jsonschema', 'init_options', 'ace_options', 'encoder' from kwargs; processes 'value' parameter; accesses 'attrs' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Dumps 'jsonschema', 'init_options', 'ace_options' into HTML attributes; outputs HTML and JavaScript; uses 'flatatt' to generate HTML attributes.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration and data inputs, serializes them into HTML attributes, renders a div with embedded scripts/styles, and outputs safe HTML for client-side JSON editor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'django.forms.util' import fallback; handling of 'unicode' and 'basestring' for compatibility; dynamic inclusion of assets based on settings; no explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django widget class that integrates a JSON editor into admin forms. It manages static asset inclusion dynamically via settings, handles compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and serializes provided data into HTML attributes safely. No malicious or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code mainly focuses on rendering a client-side JSON editor with necessary assets and data, with proper use of mark_safe and JSON serialization. No external network calls, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms are present. Overall, the code appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Django form widget for JSON editing, dynamically including scripts and styles, with careful data handling. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected. It is safe for use.",
