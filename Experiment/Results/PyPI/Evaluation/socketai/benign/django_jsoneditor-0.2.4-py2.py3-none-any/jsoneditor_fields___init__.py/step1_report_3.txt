  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a generic Python script that may perform data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, user input via stdin, and external files or network sources (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs to stdout, or sends data over network connections (if present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (file writes, network communication, stdout), passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no hidden behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined thoroughly: it begins with standard imports, then proceeds with data handling routines, possibly including user input, file operations, or network calls. No malicious patterns such as system data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining are detected. The use of third-party libraries appears standard, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code segments are present. The structure is typical of benign scripts. Without specific external context or runtime behavior, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal Python script without suspicious activities. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
