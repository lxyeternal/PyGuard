{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, reading variables, possibly environment variables, or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs, network communication points (if any), or file writes, but no untrusted data flows identified as malicious.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, with no suspicious data flow leading to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no unusual variable names or patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Static analysis shows no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no unsafe code patterns. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9), and no malicious indicators are present. Potential anomalies like hardcoded strings are noted but do not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the analysis supports a safe assessment. The code does not pose any supply chain security threat based on the static review.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
