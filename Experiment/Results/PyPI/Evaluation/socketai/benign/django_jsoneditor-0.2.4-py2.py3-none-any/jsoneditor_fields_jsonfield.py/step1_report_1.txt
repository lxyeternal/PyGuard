  "purpose": "Define custom form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for JSONField from jsonfield and jsoneditor, class definitions, and __init__/formfield methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; form and field definitions are standard.",
  "flows": "The code creates form fields and model fields for JSON data, ensuring the widget is set to JSONEditor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports JSON handling classes, defines custom form and model fields with enforced widget usage. No external data input, network communication, or data processing occurs. Methods override default behavior to set a specific widget, which is typical in form customization. No signs of malicious logic or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard customization of Django form/model fields for JSON data, enforcing a specific widget. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
