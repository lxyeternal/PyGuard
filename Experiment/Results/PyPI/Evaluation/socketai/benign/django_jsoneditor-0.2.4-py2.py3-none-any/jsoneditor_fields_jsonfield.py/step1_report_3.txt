{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget.",
  "sources": "Imports JSONField from jsonfield and jsoneditor packages, uses class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data sources or performs output operations.",
  "flows": "Imports data from external modules, initializes form fields with widget overrides, and returns formfield objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code patterns. The widget override is explicitly enforced, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for JSON data handling in Django forms and models. It subclasses existing form and model fields to enforce a specific widget (JSONEditor) for JSONFormField, ensuring consistent UI representation. The formfield method adjusts default parameters to use this widget. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, with clear intent to customize form rendering for JSON fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard customization for Django form/model fields, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It enforces a specific widget for JSON data display. Overall, it is benign and aligns with typical Django practices.",
