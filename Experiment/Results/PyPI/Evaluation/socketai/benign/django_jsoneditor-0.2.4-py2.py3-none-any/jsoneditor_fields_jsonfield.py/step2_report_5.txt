  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code customizes Django JSON fields to enforce a specific widget (JSONEditor). No suspicious activity or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior is present; the code is purely UI customization.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the widget override and lack of vulnerabilities.\n- **Assessment:** No data flow from untrusted sources; the code is for UI configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, reflecting minimal configuration risk, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The small securityRisk score accounts for potential misconfiguration if the widget input were manipulated, but in this context, it remains low.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Django form/model field customization with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No data leaks, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on class inheritance and widget enforcement.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Standard form customization without security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces the same conclusion—standard customization with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No input handling beyond UI configuration; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the context is purely UI customization with no data processing or external interactions, the low risk scores (mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one report) are justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to potential misconfiguration if widget parameters are manipulated, but in this context, it's negligible.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
