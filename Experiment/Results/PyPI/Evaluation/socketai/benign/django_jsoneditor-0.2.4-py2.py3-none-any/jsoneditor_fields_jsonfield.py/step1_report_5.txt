  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form and model fields for use in Django forms, integrating JSONEditor as the widget.",
  "sources": "Import statements for jsonfield and jsoneditor modules; class initializations and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls like super().__init__() and super().formfield(), which utilize untrusted parameters if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Initialization of JSONFormField with widget assignment, passing widget via kwargs, and formfield method passing parameters downstream.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard class inheritance and method overriding. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom subclasses of JSONField and JSONFormField, explicitly setting a custom widget (JSONEditor) for form rendering. The __init__ method enforces the widget assignment, preventing override. The formfield method overrides default behavior to set form_class to JSONFormField unless specified otherwise. All code appears to implement standard form customization with no suspicious data handling, malicious behavior, or obfuscated logic. No input sources or untrusted data flows are present beyond standard form processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward customization of Django form fields for JSON data, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard patterns and libraries without suspicious modifications.",
