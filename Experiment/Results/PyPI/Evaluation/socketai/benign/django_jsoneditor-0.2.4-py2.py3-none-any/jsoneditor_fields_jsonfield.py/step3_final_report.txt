{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django form and model fields to enforce the use of a specific JSON editor widget for JSON data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules (`jsonfield`, `jsoneditor`) and class constructors (`__init__`, `formfield`) that set or override widget configurations.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, transmission, or execution of untrusted data occurs; primarily UI configuration.",
  "flows": "The constructor in `JSONFormField` sets the widget to `JSONEditor`, and `JSONField`'s `formfield()` method sets the form class to `JSONFormField`, ensuring consistent widget enforcement.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external JSON field classes and subclasses them to enforce a specific widget (`JSONEditor`) in Django forms and models. The `__init__` method in `JSONFormField` forcibly sets the widget, preventing override, which is standard for UI consistency. The `formfield()` method in `JSONField` overrides the default to ensure the form class used is `JSONFormField`. There is no dynamic code execution, data leak, or external data processing. The code is clear, standard, and intended solely for UI customization. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it transmit or execute code dynamically. The widget enforcement is explicit and controlled, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django customization for JSON fields, enforcing a specific widget without processing untrusted data or performing any malicious actions. All signals and patterns indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
