  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form and model fields for use in Django applications, integrating a JSON editor widget.",
  "sources": "Import statements for JSONField from jsonfield and jsoneditor modules, class initializations, and method definitions that set widget types.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the form_class and widget parameters that could accept untrusted input if misconfigured, but in this context, they are used for UI configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets attributes for form fields.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code overrides default widget to enforce use of JSONEditor, which appears to be intentional for UI purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific JSON field classes from external modules and extends them with custom classes. It enforces the use of a JSON editor widget and customizes the formfield method to use this widget by default. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to facilitate JSON data handling in Django forms with a specific UI widget. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for customizing form fields in Django to use a specific JSON editor widget. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
