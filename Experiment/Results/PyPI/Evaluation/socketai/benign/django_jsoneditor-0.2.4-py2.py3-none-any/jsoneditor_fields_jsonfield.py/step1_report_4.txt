{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom form field classes for handling JSON data in a web framework, specifically overriding default widget behavior with a JSON editor component.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules and class initializations, and uses the constructor of JSONFormField and the formfield method of JSONField.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code; it primarily sets up form field classes and widgets without executing external commands or handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The code flows from class definitions to method calls that set widget types and return form field instances; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The widget assignment in __init__ is straightforward. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports JSONField and JSONFormField classes, then subclasses JSONFormField to enforce a specific widget (JSONEditor). The JSONField class overrides formfield to set a default form_class. All operations involve standard class inheritance and method overriding, with no indication of malicious behavior. The purpose appears to be customizing form behavior for JSON data input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is clear and standard, with no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely sets up custom form fields for JSON input handling in a web form context, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for user interface customization.",
