  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and primarily customizes form fields with a specific widget.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk is minimal; perhaps a slight UI customization, but no security concern.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.  \n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions made about vulnerabilities.  \n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, similar to Report 1, it’s a benign customization.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 is appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No security issues, just UI configuration.  \n- **Malware score:** Correct.  \n- **Assumptions:** None.  \n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, again a straightforward form field customization.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No security risk.  \n- **Malware score:** Correct.  \n- **Assumptions:** None.  \n- **Consistency:** Scores align.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is a simple class extension with widget enforcement.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No security concern.  \n- **Malware score:** Correct.  \n- **Assumptions:** None.  \n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No, similar to previous reports, purely customization.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** Correct.  \n- **Assumptions:** None.  \n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk close to 0) are appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** Very low, around 0-0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Overall:** The code is a straightforward, well-understood customization of form fields for UI purposes, with no security threats detected.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, just a UI customization with no security implications)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
