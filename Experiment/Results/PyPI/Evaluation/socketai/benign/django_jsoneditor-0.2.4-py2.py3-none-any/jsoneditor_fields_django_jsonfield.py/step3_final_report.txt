{
  "purpose": "The code customizes Django form fields for JSON data by enforcing a specific widget (JSONEditor) and ensuring form fields use this widget.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (`jsonfield`, `jsoneditor`) and defines subclasses that set the widget during initialization and form field creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code only sets UI components without processing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The widget is assigned during class initialization and formfield creation, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with clear class inheritance and widget assignment. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external libraries and defines subclasses to enforce a JSON editor widget in Django forms. It does not perform data validation, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely UI/UX enhancement. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. External dependencies are standard but should be verified for security, though the code itself remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of Django form fields for JSON data input, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and minimal security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
