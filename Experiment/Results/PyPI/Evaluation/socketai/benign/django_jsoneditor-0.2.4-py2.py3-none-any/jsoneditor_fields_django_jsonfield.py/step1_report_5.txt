{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget for editing.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries ('jsonfield' and 'jsoneditor') and the class methods that create form fields.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data directly; it primarily defines form field classes.",
  "flows": "The code initializes custom form fields that would eventually process data from user input in a Django form context, but there are no direct data flows or external data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The widget override is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing JSONField classes for Django, enforcing a specific widget (JSONEditor) for JSON input in forms. It does not perform any data validation, network operations, or execute untrusted code. The class structures are simple and use standard inheritance. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's purpose is purely to customize form representation for JSON data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard customization for Django form and model fields related to JSON data input, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
