  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form and model fields with a specific widget for use in Django forms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries: jsonfield and jsoneditor.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as super().__init__() and super().formfield() that process input data; use of external widget JSONEditor.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into formfield() method, which then applies default widget and passes data to parent class; widget is set to JSONEditor, which could be an external component.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code forcibly assigns a widget but does not process or manipulate data directly.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes JSON form and model fields by overriding class methods and setting a specific widget. It uses external libraries for JSON handling and a custom widget. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation. The widget assignment is straightforward and controlled. No untrusted input processing or external network calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard customization of Django form/model fields for JSON data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
