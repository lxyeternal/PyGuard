{
  "purpose": "This code customizes form fields for handling JSON data using external libraries, primarily to enforce specific widgets in forms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data when instantiating form fields and form classes, especially via the __init__ method of JSONFormField and formfield method of JSONField.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve rendering or processing form data, but no direct data output or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation of JSONFormField, passing data into the form, and from formfield setup in JSONField; no external data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution, are present. The code mainly enforces a widget class and sets defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code imports JSONField and JSONFormField from an external library, then subclasses JSONFormField to set a specific widget (JSONEditor) during initialization. The JSONField subclass modifies the formfield method to ensure the form class defaults to JSONFormField, integrating the custom widget. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external network calls, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward customization of form components, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard customization of form fields using external libraries to enforce specific widgets for JSON data. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security threats.",
