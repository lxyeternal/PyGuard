  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form and data fields with a specific widget for use in Django forms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for json_field and jsoneditor modules; class initializations and method calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no potential data leaks or security effects identified.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; class constructors set widget attributes without processing untrusted data; formfield method sets default form class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected; straightforward class definitions and method overrides.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing classes to enforce specific widget usage in Django form fields, avoiding widget override in __init__ and setting defaults in formfield. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network activity or secret management. The code is standard class extension with method overrides and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension of form fields to set a specific widget and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for customizing form behavior.",
