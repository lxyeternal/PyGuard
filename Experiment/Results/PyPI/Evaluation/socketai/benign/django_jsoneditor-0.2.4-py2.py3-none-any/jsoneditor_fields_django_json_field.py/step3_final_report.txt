  "purpose": "Customize Django form fields for JSON data by enforcing a specific widget (JSONEditor) and default form class.",
  "sources": "Imports from json_field and jsoneditor libraries; class attributes and method overrides that set widget and form class.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network activity, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Class initialization and method calls that assign widget and form class, with no untrusted data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance and attribute setting, no suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two subclasses to enforce a JSON editor widget in Django forms. It imports external libraries, overrides constructors and methods to set widget and form class defaults. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with standard Django customization practices. No anomalies or security issues are detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and security risk scores of 0, and high confidence levels. The code does not perform any risky operations or contain obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django form field customization enforcing a specific widget. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
