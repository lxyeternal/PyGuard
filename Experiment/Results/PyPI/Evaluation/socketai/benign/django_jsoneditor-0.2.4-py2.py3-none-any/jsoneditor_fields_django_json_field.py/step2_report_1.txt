  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward class extensions for Django form fields, primarily to enforce a specific widget (JSONEditor) for JSON data handling.\n- No report indicates any data input/output points, network activity, environment variable access, or other typical vectors for malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, secret handling, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is consistent: subclassing existing classes, setting a widget attribute, and overriding formfield to enforce a default form class.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it imports from external libraries (`json_field`, `jsoneditor`), subclasses form fields, and enforces a widget.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or structure.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are detected.\n- The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n- No security vulnerabilities or code quality issues are apparent.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0.\n- This aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code is a benign customization for form handling.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The only slight variation is report 5's confidence score (0.9), but given the simplicity, 1 would be more consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard pattern for customizing form fields in Django, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and intended for UI customization. No changes to scores are necessary.",
