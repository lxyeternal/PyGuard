{
  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form fields for use in web forms, integrating JSONEditor as a widget.",
  "sources": "Import statements for json_field and jsoneditor modules; class definitions; method overrides.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code primarily defines classes and methods without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class extension and method override patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from external modules and subclasses them to customize behavior. The JSONFormField class enforces a specific widget (JSONEditor) by setting it in the constructor. The JSONField class overrides formfield to set a default form_class. There are no data inputs, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and appears to be designed for customizing form behavior in a web framework, likely Django.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard customization of form fields for JSON data in web forms. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is typical and does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
