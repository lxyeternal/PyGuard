{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom form field classes for handling JSON data, specifically integrating a JSON editor widget for user interface purposes within a Django-like framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and method parameters, specifically from imported modules and within class initializers and method calls.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly configures form field classes and widgets without executing external or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class inheritance and method overrides to control widget assignment and form field creation; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code straightforwardly configures form fields and widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports JSON handling classes and form widgets, then defines subclasses that assign a JSON editor widget explicitly, preventing widget override. The 'formfield' method customizes the form class used for the JSONField, ensuring a consistent widget interface. The logic is simple and directly related to form customization, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard form configuration code for a web application framework, intended to integrate a JSON editor widget for better user experience. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
