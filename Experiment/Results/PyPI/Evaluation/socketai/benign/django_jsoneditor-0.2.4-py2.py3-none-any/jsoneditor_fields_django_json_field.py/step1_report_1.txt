  "purpose": "Defines custom form fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Imports from json_field and jsoneditor libraries, class initializations, and method overrides that process form data.",
  "kills": "No explicit data input or output points; no network, file, or environment variable interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code mainly modifies class behavior for form fields without data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard class inheritance and method overriding.",
  "analysis": "The code creates subclasses for JSON handling form fields, explicitly setting a widget and overriding methods to enforce this widget. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate customization for form fields in a Django project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
