{
  "purpose": "Define custom JSON form fields for use in Django forms with a specific widget (JSONEditor).",
  "sources": "Imports from json_field and jsoneditor modules, class initializations, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily involves class inheritance and configuration; no direct sinks for untrusted data are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to class constructors and method calls flow into formfield configurations, but there are no dangerous or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward class customization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, JSONFormField and JSONField, customizing behavior for JSON form handling in Django. It imports external libraries, sets a specific widget, and ensures that the widget cannot be overridden unintentionally. No input validation, external data handling, or insecure code practices are present. The structure is standard for Django form customization and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard, harmless Django form customization code for handling JSON fields with a specific widget. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
