  "purpose": "Define custom Django model and form fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget",
  "sources": "Import statements for JSONField and JSONFormField from Django, and JSONEditor from jsoneditor.forms",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; usage of formfield and widget assignment is standard",
  "flows": "Input data from user forms processed through formfield, displayed/edited via JSONEditor widget",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code customizes Django model and form fields to use a specific JSON editor widget. It forces the widget in the form field constructor and overrides the formfield method to assign a specific form class. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices without introducing security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical customization of Django form and model fields for JSON handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
