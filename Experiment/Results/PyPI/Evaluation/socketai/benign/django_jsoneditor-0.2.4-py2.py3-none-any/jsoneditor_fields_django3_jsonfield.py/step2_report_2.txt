  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, correctness, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description—custom Django form and model fields with a specific widget (JSONEditor). No code anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The logic is straightforward, and the implementation aligns with standard Django practices.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, perhaps just for custom UI, not a security concern.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is reasonable; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, consistent with the code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n- **Justification:** The absence of security issues is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code remains consistent; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — again, a minor UI customization, not security-related.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous reports; no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security issues.\n- **Justification:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is acceptable given the code's purpose as a UI customization; no real security risk exists.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The code is a standard Django extension for customizing JSON form fields with a specific widget.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is safe, with only UI customization.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scoring and reasoning are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
