{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget (JSONEditor) in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db.models, django.forms, and jsoneditor.forms; uses self.widget and super() calls for class initialization and method overriding.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to pass untrusted data to sensitive sinks like network or file operations; formfield and widget assignment are internal.",
  "flows": "Defines class inheritance and method overrides to ensure the JSONFormField uses JSONEditor widget, with no external data flow or user input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution. The code uses standard Django patterns for form and model fields.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom Django form and model fields for JSON data, replacing default widgets with a specific JSONEditor widget. It overrides __init__ to enforce widget assignment and formfield to specify the form class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It relies on standard Django practices and external libraries for rendering forms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward customization of Django fields to integrate a JSON editor widget. No malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation are detected. It seems safe within the scope of typical Django form and model usage.",
