  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form and model fields for JSON data with a custom widget for editing JSON.",
  "sources": "Imports JSON data from Django models and forms, uses JSONEditor for widget rendering.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; primarily defines data structure and widget handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model field to form field, with widget specification overriding defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's JSONField and JSONFormField to enforce the use of a custom widget (JSONEditor). It does not process or handle untrusted input directly, but merely sets up form/model fields. The import and use of JSONEditor is consistent with a JSON editing interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data leaks. The code’s purpose appears to be enhancing JSON editing UI within Django forms, not executing or transmitting data maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for customizing JSON form fields in Django applications with a specific widget. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
