{
  "purpose": "To define custom Django form and model fields for handling JSON data with a specific widget.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or untrusted data; mainly class definitions and method overrides.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly handling untrusted data or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and method calls for form and model field creation, but no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes Django form and model fields for JSON data, integrating a JSON editor widget. It overrides the __init__ method to enforce widget assignment and modifies the formfield method to set default form classes. There are no input/output data flows involving untrusted sources, no network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard extension of Django form/model fields.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward customization of Django JSON fields for a specific widget. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and serves a UI purpose.",
