  "purpose": "Customize Django's JSONField and JSONFormField to enforce the use of a specific JSONEditor widget for JSON data handling in forms and models.",
  "sources": "Django's JSONField and JSONFormField classes, imported modules, and the widget assignment within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data sources, or data leaks; widget assignment is internal and static.",
  "flows": "Class initialization enforces widget assignment; formfield method sets form class to JSONFormField; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance and widget enforcement without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Django model and form fields for JSON data, replacing default widgets with a specific JSONEditor widget. It uses standard inheritance, with __init__ overriding to set the widget, and formfield() method to specify the form class. There are no external data reads, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely structural, aimed at UI customization. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is correct and aligns with Django best practices. Given this, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django customization for JSON editing UI, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These accurately reflect the code's nature and safety.",
