  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**  \n   All reports describe a single line of code: assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. This is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. They are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0 in all cases, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, reflecting high certainty about benignity, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign, and there's no indication of malicious intent, the risk scores should remain at 0. No reason exists to increase them.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis. There are no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard practice.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary and final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version assignment, typical in Python packages, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
