{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a direct assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is minimal, transparent, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string assignment with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The existing reports and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
