  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks possible as no data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable named __version__, which is a common practice in Python packaging. There are no functions, no data input, no external calls, and no suspicious behavior present in this single line. It does not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is typical in Python modules for version tracking.",
