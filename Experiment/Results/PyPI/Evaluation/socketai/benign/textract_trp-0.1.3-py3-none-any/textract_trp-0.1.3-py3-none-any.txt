      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured OCR data parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It solely organizes input data into hierarchical objects for further processing. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is effectively negligible."
