{
  "purpose": "Classes for parsing and representing OCR document data, including bounding boxes, polygons, text blocks, lines, tables, and pages, primarily for organizing OCR output from services like AWS Textract.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries representing OCR response data such as 'Geometry', 'BlockType', 'Relationships', 'Text', etc.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data transmission; internal data structures only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class instances, constructing hierarchical representations of document components.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns; straightforward data parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes modeling OCR output, with no network calls, code injection, or external effects. It processes untrusted OCR data but does not execute or transmit it maliciously. The structure is clear, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports accounts for untrusted data handling but does not indicate vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured OCR data parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It solely organizes input data into hierarchical objects for further processing. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is effectively negligible.",
