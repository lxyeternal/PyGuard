{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and parsing logic for processing structured OCR (Optical Character Recognition) data, such as bounding boxes, polygons, and text blocks, from a document response.",
  "sources": "Data sources are primarily the input 'geometry' dictionaries and the 'Blocks' in the responsePages object, which are parsed to instantiate objects like BoundingBox, Polygon, Word, Line, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to external effects are present; the code mainly processes and structures input data without executing untrusted code or writing to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (geometry, blocks) flow into class constructors and are stored as object attributes; no external system calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly structured, primarily data modeling with no code obfuscation, external network calls, or secret handling. No hidden or unusual behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically models OCR data structures, parsing input dictionaries into class instances with properties for easy access. It does not perform any unsafe operations, code injection, or network activity. It relies on safe data handling and does not execute external code or commands. The logic appears to be standard for OCR data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data modeling and parsing implementation for OCR response data. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Its purpose is to structure and access OCR output safely, with no security risks detected.",
