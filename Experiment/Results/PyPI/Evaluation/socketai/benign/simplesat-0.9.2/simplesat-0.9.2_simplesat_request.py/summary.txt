  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores in the reports are justified by potential API misuse but do not indicate actual malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.0, and a minimal risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given the API exposure potential."
