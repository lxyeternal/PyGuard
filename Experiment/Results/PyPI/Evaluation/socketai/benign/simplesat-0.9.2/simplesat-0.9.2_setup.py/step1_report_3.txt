  "purpose": "This script appears to be for setting up a Python package, including reading a version number and writing it to a version file.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file for version info; writing to '_version.py' in 'simplesat' directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '_version.py' file; calling setup() from setuptools.",
  "flows": "Read 'VERSION' -> Write version string to '_version.py' -> Call setup() to package.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes version information directly into a source file, which is typical; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the version number from a 'VERSION' file and writes it into a Python file '_version.py' within the 'simplesat' directory, setting __version__ variable. It then calls setup() to initiate package setup. All operations are straightforward and standard for package version management. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading and writing version info and calling setup(). No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
