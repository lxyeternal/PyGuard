  "purpose": "Set up package metadata and write version information to a file.",
  "sources": "Reading version from a file ('VERSION').",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file ('simplesat/_version.py').",
  "flows": "Read version from 'VERSION' -> write version string to '_version.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes version info to a Python file, which is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the version string from an external 'VERSION' file and writes this information into 'simplesat/_version.py'. The 'setup()' call is a typical setup invocation without arguments, suggesting default setup behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious data flow, or suspicious code patterns. The file writing operation appears intended for version tracking rather than malicious activity. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs standard package setup tasks with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package version management.",
