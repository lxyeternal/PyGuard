  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation for the 'simplesat' project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; environment variable 'READTHEDOCS'; hardcoded project info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct untrusted data handling or sensitive data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted inputs or sensitive data; mainly static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely configuration with no code execution, dynamic imports, or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up documentation build configuration using standard Sphinx parameters and environment checks. No suspicious code, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The only dynamic element is reading an environment variable to set the theme, which is common in configuration scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It strictly defines documentation build parameters without any harmful behavior.",
