  "purpose": "Assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security issues or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
