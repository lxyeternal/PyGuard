  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; simple string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the variable __version__. There are no input operations, no data processing, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. This pattern is common in Python packages to specify versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply setting a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
