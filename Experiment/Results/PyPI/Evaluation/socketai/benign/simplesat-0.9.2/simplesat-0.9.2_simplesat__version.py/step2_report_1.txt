  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n- All reports describe a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"0.9.2\"`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for versioning in Python packages.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound: static string assignment with no suspicious activity.\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned:**\n- `confidence`: all reports are at 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- `obfuscated`: all are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- `malware`: all are 0, correctly indicating no malware.\n- `securityRisk`: all are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n- The code is purely metadata with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is accurate.\n- No suspicious activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.9.2\"\n```\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk associated with static version assignment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard version string assignment.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
