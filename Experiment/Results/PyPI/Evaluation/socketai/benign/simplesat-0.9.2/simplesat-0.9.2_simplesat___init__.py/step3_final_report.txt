{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and classes, sets up the public API via __all__, and attempts to import version information with a fallback.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules, optional import of _version module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data processing",
  "flows": "Import statements and assignment to __all__, with version import flow from _version to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static imports, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, performing static imports of classes and variables, defining __all__, and handling optional version import. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a typical package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and do not require modification.",
