{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file to expose classes and variables from multiple modules for package imports.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files, including optional version import with fallback.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block for optional import of version info; this is a standard pattern and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and variables from local modules within the package, with a fallback mechanism for the __version__ variable. The __all__ list exposes the imported symbols. There are no external inputs, network connections, or data handling that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file, aimed at defining the package namespace.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs no data processing, external communication, or suspicious operations.",
