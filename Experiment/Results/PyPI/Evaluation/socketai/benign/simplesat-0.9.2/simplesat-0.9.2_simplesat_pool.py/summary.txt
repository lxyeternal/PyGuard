  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The minor info leakage via exception messages is acceptable and does not elevate the overall security risk significantly. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are correct; the low security risk score (around 0.1) reflects a cautious but justified assessment."
