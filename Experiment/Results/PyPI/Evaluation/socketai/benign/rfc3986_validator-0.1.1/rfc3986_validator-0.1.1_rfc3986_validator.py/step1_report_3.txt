{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and regex patterns for validating URIs according to RFC3986 standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines regex patterns and a validation function that takes a URL string as input.",
  "sinks": "The validate_rfc3986 function performs regex matching on input URLs but does not execute or process untrusted data beyond pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are checked against precompiled regex patterns; no data is written to external systems or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of regex pattern definitions for validating URIs and a simple validation function that matches input strings against these patterns. The regex patterns are complex but standard for URI validation based on RFC3986. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. The code does not interact with external systems, environment variables, or perform network operations. It solely performs pattern matching on provided URLs, which is a safe operation. The only function, validate_rfc3986, raises an exception on invalid parameters, which is standard behavior and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URI validation utility using regex patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on pattern matching for URLs.",
