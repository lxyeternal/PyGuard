{
  "purpose": "Provides regex-based validation for URIs according to RFC 3986, supporting full URIs and relative references.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL string to match against compiled regex patterns for URI components.",
  "sinks": "Performs regex match operations on untrusted input data to determine validity.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> regex matching functions -> match object indicating validity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; regex patterns are complex but standard for URI validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines comprehensive regex patterns for IPv6, authority, path, query, and fragment components of URIs, compiles them for efficiency, and provides a validation function. It only performs pattern matching without executing external commands, processing data beyond validation, or obfuscating logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The regex complexity could pose ReDoS risks if misused, but this is inherent to regex validation and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's functionality and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC3986-compliant URI validation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The low security risk score is justified, and the code poses minimal supply chain risk.",
