{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and regex patterns to validate URIs and URI references according to RFC 3986 standards.",
  "sources": "Constants and regex patterns are defined at the beginning; the validate_rfc3986 function reads input parameters 'url' and 'rule'.",
  "sinks": "The 'match' method of compiled regex objects is used to validate input URLs, but no external or system commands are invoked, nor is untrusted data directly executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings flow into the validate_rfc3986 function, where they are matched against regex patterns; no other data flow or external interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code segments. Regex patterns are complex but are typical for URI validation. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines detailed regex patterns for IPv6, authority, path, query, fragment, URI, and relative references, compiled for performance. The validate_rfc3986 function performs regex matching to validate URLs according to RFC 3986 standards. No dynamic code execution, system interaction, or malicious logic is present. It simply validates whether input strings conform to URI syntax. The code appears purely for validation purposes and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URI validation module based on RFC 3986. It performs regex-based validation without any malicious or suspicious activity. No malware, data exfiltration, or supply chain risks are evident.",
