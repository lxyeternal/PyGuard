  "purpose": "Provides regex-based validation for URIs according to RFC3986 standards.",
  "sources": "Defines regex patterns and functions for URI validation, including user input validation in URLs.",
  "sinks": "Regex match operations which could process untrusted URL strings.",
  "flows": "Input URL string is validated against compiled regex patterns; no data flow outside validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Regex patterns are complex but legitimate for URI validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines detailed regex patterns for IPv6, authority, path, query, and fragment parts of URIs. It compiles regex for URI and relative URI validation and offers a validation function. No untrusted data processing beyond validation is present. The code appears to serve as a URI validation utility, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The use of regex for URI validation is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URI validation utility implementing RFC3986 regex patterns. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. It processes URL strings for validation purposes only. No security risks identified.",
