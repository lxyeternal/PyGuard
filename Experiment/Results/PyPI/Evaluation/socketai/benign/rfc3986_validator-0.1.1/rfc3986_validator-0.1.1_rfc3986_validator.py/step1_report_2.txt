{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate URLs and URI references according to RFC 3986 standards using regular expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input URLs or URI strings passed to the validate_rfc3986 function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a boolean match object indicating validity; it does not process or store untrusted data beyond validation.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are checked against compiled regex patterns to determine validity; no data is transferred elsewhere or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Regex patterns are complex but appear consistent with standard URI validation; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for validating IPv6 addresses, authorities, path characters, queries, and complete URIs, including relative references. These patterns are compiled for efficiency. The validate_rfc3986 function performs pattern matching based on the rule parameter, which defaults to 'URI'. The implementation appears to be a straightforward, standards-compliant URL validation utility. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. No malicious or sabotage indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a URL/URI validation utility using regex patterns aligned with RFC 3986. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to validate URL correctness, not to process or exfiltrate data.",
