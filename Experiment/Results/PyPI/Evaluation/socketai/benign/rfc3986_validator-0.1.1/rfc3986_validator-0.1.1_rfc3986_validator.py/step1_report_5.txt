{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and regex patterns to validate URIs according to RFC3986 standards, primarily for URI and URI reference validation.",
  "sources": "Reads static regex patterns for URI validation, function parameters for URL strings, and the function call itself.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if external URL input is validated and used unsafely elsewhere, but within this code, no direct data leakage or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are validated against compiled regex patterns. No external data flows or untrusted data handling within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with complex regex patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines regex patterns for IPv6 addresses, authority parts, path characters, query, fragment, and constructs comprehensive URI and relative URI regexes. These are compiled and used in the 'validate_rfc3986' function to validate input URLs based on the selected rule. The regex patterns follow RFC specifications and are statically defined, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The only potential concern is that the function returns regex match objects directly, which in some contexts may need to be checked for truthiness, but this is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured URI validation utility based on RFC3986, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. It is purely a validation module with no evident malicious behavior.",
