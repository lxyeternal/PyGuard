{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the `rfc3986_validator` package, designed to validate URI and URI reference formats using pytest, hypothesis, and rfc3987.",
  "sources": "The code reads URI strings from predefined tuples of valid and invalid URIs, as well as from hypothesis-generated URLs. It also calls `validate_rfc3986()` and `rfc3987.parse()` functions with these URLs.",
  "sinks": "The functions `validate_rfc3986()` and `rfc3987.parse()` are the primary sinks; they process input URLs. No other sinks are evident, and there are no network operations or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "Sources of URLs (tuples or hypothesis generator) flow into validation functions (`validate_rfc3986()` and `rfc3987.parse()`), which return boolean results indicating validity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The test code is standard and solely for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and the target validation functions. It defines numerous test cases with valid and invalid URIs, parameterized tests for different rules ('URI' and 'URI_reference'), and cross-validates using legacy functions. The tests utilize external data sources and do not execute or evaluate untrusted code or inputs dynamically. The inputs are static tuples or generated URLs, and there are no code execution, network activity, or data leaks involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for URI validation and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static or generated input data, passes it to validation functions, and asserts expected outcomes. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
