  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a header comment with no executable statements, data processing, or input/output handling.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity in any of the snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of code logic, data flows, and potential security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all code snippets are just headers with no executable code, no data handling, and no suspicious features, there is no justification for any risk scores above 0.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malware activity is present; the code is just a header comment.\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious features.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent across reports and align with the actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code snippets are harmless header comments with no executable code, data flow, or suspicious features. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary. The code poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.",
