  "purpose": "Header comment and encoding declaration for a Python unit test package, serving as documentation.",
  "sources": "None; only header comments and encoding declaration present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "None; no executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of comments and encoding declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a descriptive comment. There are no functions, classes, data handling, or executable statements. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, minimal nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified given the straightforward content. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely boilerplate header content with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
