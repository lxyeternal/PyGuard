  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the script is a straightforward setup.py with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Code confirmation:** The code reads a README.md, defines static requirements, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no external input handling, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup.py practices.\n- **Code confirmation:** Same as above; no anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms standard setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Code confirmation:** Same pattern, static reading of README.md, static metadata, no dynamic code or network calls.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Notable point:** The report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, citing perhaps a minimal concern.\n- **Code confirmation:** Same as others; no dynamic input, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 might be slightly overestimating; since the code is static and benign, the risk should remain at 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup script.\n- **Code confirmation:** No anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard setup.py script.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, matching the code's nature.\n- The only minor inconsistency is in Report 4, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. Given the static, benign nature, this should be 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely configuration, with no dynamic or malicious components.\n- The malware score should be 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The overall risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
