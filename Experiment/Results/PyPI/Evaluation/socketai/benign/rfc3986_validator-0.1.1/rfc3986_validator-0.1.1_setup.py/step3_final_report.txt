{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies without executing any dynamic or malicious operations.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata, requirements list, and calls setup() with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reading and variable definitions into the setup() function; no external or untrusted data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for Python packaging, involving static reading of a README file and defining package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or obfuscated elements. All indicators point to benign, standard behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
