{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to obtain long description; no other input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script primarily defines package setup parameters without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, defines dependencies and metadata, and calls setuptools.setup(). No external input is processed dynamically during execution, and there are no network calls or code injections. All elements follow standard packaging conventions. The script does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
