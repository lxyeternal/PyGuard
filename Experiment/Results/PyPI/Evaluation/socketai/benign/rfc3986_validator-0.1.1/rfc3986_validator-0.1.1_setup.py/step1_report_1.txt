  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project, specifically a RFC 3986 validator.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; no input data read from external sources during execution.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs to external systems; no untrusted data handling or external network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup process is standard package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present; code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README file, defines requirements, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no environment variable misuse, and no malicious logic observed. The package appears to be a straightforward configuration for a Python package. All operations are typical for a setup script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose security risks.",
