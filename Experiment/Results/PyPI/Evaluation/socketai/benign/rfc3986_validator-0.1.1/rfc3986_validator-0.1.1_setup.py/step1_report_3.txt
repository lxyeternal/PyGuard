{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'rfc3986_validator'. Its purpose is to specify package metadata, dependencies, and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines static package metadata such as author, email, URL, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or process untrusted data; no code execution, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only reads static files and defines package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other setup options. The code only performs static file reading and package setup tasks without executing untrusted input or making network connections. All code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and consistent with common Python package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious activity.",
