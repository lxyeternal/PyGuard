  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'rfc3986_validator'. It prepares the package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration needed for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; no data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads external file 'README.md' -> uses its content in package setup; no flow of untrusted data into system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and configuration options. All elements are typical for Python package distribution. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, code injection, or backdoors is evident. No obfuscated or complex malicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It performs expected functions without anomalies.",
