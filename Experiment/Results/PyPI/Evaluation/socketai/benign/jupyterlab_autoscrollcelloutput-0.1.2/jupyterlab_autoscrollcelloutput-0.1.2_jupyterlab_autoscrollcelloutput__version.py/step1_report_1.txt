{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version string from a package.json file located in the same directory or its subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The code reads from package.json files located in the directory tree starting from the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; it only reads and processes JSON data.",
  "flows": "The code locates package.json files, loads their JSON content, extracts the 'version' field, and transforms it; no external or untrusted data flow leads to a security risk.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to find package.json files under its directory tree, loads the version info, and formats it. The only potential concern is if the JSON files are malicious or tampered, but this is a normal expected behavior for version retrieval. No insecure practices, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for extracting and formatting version info from package.json files. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and does not involve any risky operations.",
