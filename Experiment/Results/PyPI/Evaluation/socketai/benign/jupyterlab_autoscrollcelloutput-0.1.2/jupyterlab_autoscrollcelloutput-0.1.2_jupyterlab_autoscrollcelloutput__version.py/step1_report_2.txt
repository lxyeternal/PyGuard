{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version number from a package.json file located somewhere in the current directory or its subdirectories.",
  "sources": "Reading the package.json file via Path.rglob() and json.load()",
  "sinks": "Returning the processed version string; no data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "From file reading (sources) to parsing JSON and returning the version string (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns; straightforward file reading and JSON parsing",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that searches recursively for package.json files from the current script's directory. It attempts to open each found package.json, read the 'version' field, and normalize its format by replacing certain suffixes. If no package.json is found, it raises an error. The process is standard for version retrieval and contains no malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation of fetching and formatting a version number from package.json files. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
