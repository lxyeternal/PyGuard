{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version information from a package.json file located somewhere within the directory hierarchy of the script, and formats the version string for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files named 'package.json' found via recursive search starting from the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted external input beyond reading local files; the version string is simply returned and processed internally.",
  "flows": "The source (reading 'package.json') flows to parsing the JSON content and extracting the 'version' key, which is then formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code performs a straightforward file search and JSON parsing without any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function '_fetchVersion' that searches recursively for 'package.json' files starting from the script's directory. Upon finding such a file, it reads and parses the JSON content to extract the 'version' field, then replaces certain substrings to standardize version notation. If no file is found, it raises a FileNotFoundError. The script sets '__version__' to the retrieved version. There are no external network calls, no processing of untrusted external data beyond local files, and no suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version-fetching utility that safely reads local 'package.json' files to obtain version information. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, benign script.",
