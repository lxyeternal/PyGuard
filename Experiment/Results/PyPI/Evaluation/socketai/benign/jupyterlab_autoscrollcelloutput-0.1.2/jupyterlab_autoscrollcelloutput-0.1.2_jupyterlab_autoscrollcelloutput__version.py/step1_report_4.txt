  "purpose": "To retrieve and process the version information from a package.json file located within the project directory.",
  "sources": "Reading from package.json files via Path.rglob and json.load.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally and does not write or send data externally; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Path.rglob finds package.json files → json.load reads the file content → version string is manipulated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code only reads local files and performs straightforward string replacements.",
  "analysis": "The script locates package.json files recursively within the directory, reads the 'version' field, and reformats pre-release tags. No external network calls or code execution is present. The exception handling only catches FileNotFoundError, which is appropriate. The code appears standard and intended solely for version extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of reading and formatting version data from local package.json files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
