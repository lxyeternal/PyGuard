  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version string from a package.json file located somewhere in the project directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the package.json file from the filesystem using Path.rglob and json.load",
  "sinks": "Parsing JSON data; no untrusted data is written or executed directly",
  "flows": "Path.rglob('package.json') -> open() -> json.load() -> extract 'version' -> string replacement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed; straightforward file reading and JSON parsing",
  "analysis": "The script searches for a package.json file within the directory tree of the script's location. It opens the first such file found, loads its JSON content, and extracts the 'version' field. It then normalizes version labels (alpha, beta, rc). No input from external or untrusted sources is processed; no code injection or malicious behavior detected. The logic is simple and safe. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for reading and processing version info from a package.json file. It appears benign with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
