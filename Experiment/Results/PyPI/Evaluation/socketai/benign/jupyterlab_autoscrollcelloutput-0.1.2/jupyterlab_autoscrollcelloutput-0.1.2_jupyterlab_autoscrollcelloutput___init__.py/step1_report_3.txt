  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a JSON file to define Jupyter Lab extension paths.",
  "sources": "Reading 'package.json' file located in a subdirectory relative to the script.",
  "sinks": "Returning a dictionary with extension path info; no external data sinks or output manipulation present.",
  "flows": "Reading package.json file -> returning extension path data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and file reading appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a JSON file 'package.json' from a specific directory. It loads the JSON data and provides a function to return a dictionary with source and destination info for a Jupyter Lab extension. The code relies on the JSON file for configuration data. No external network connections, code execution, or data leaks are evident. The usage is typical for Jupyter extension packages, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and performs a standard operation for Jupyter Lab extensions. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
