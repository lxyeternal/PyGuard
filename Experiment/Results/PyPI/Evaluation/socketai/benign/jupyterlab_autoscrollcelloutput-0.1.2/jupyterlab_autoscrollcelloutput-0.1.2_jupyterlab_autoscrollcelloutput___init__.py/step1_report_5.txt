  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a JSON file and provide extension path information for Jupyter Lab.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'package.json' file located in the 'labextension' directory.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks detected; no data leaks or untrusted data execution identified.",
  "flows": "Read 'package.json' file -> load JSON data -> return extension path information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code only reads local files and returns static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, determines the current directory, and loads data from a local JSON file. It then defines a function that returns a dictionary with extension paths based on the loaded data. There are no signs of malicious activity, external data handling, or suspicious code constructs. The operations are standard for package configuration and extension setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for Jupyter Lab extensions. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
