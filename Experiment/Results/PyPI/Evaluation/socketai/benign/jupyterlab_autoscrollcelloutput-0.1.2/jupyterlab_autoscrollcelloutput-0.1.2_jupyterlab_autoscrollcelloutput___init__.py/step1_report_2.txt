  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a JSON file and provide lab extension paths for Jupyter.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'package.json' file located within the labextension directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leak or effect are present.",
  "flows": "Read 'package.json' -> return extension path data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the package version and package metadata from a JSON file within the extension directory. It then defines a function to return the path mapping for Jupyter lab extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code patterns, or security risks. It uses standard library functions safely. No sources or sinks indicate vulnerabilities or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a Jupyter extension setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
