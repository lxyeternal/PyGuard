  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'jupyterlab_autoscrollcelloutput' extension, including reading metadata, handling build dependencies, and defining package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local files ('package.json', 'README.md'), environment variables, and optional build tools.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed into dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads local files -> processes version string -> configures setup parameters -> optional build steps via 'jupyter_packaging' -> final package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for a JupyterLab extension. It reads local configuration files, processes version info, and conditionally imports build tools with graceful fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or external network activity. The optional dependencies are handled safely, and the code adheres to common packaging practices. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a routine, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
