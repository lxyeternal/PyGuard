{
  "purpose": "The code defines a ServiceProxy class that acts as a delegate or wrapper around an underlying service object, forwarding method calls and property accesses.",
  "sources": "The code reads from class properties (e.g., self._service, type(self)), method parameters (service, context, reason), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on self._service (e.g., add_dependency, start, stop, crash, restart), property setters (beacon, crash_reason), and method returns.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like service objects or context managers flow into methods and are delegated to self._service; property getters/setters access self._service attributes; method calls are forwarded directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The class appears to be a standard proxy pattern implementation with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a proxy pattern to delegate method calls and properties to an underlying service object, which is abstracted via the _service property. It uses standard Python features, including abstract properties, async methods, and property decorators. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, network communication, or data leaks. The design is typical for a service proxy meant to add abstraction or flexibility in a larger system. All imported modules and class methods are related to service management and do not contain malicious code. The code appears well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a transparent proxy for a service object without any signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard implementation pattern without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
