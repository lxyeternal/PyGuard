  "purpose": "Implementation of the observer pattern with support for asynchronous and synchronous signals, allowing registration, deregistration, and emission of events to connected handlers.",
  "sources": "Input data can originate from external code calling methods like connect(), disconnect(), or when signals are emitted via __call__ or send(), which may pass arbitrary arguments and sender objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the receivers invoked during signal emission, which are called with potentially untrusted data. These receivers could execute malicious code if they are malicious handlers, though this depends on the handlers themselves.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external code calling connect()/disconnect(), then signal emission via __call__ or send(), passing arbitrary args and sender objects, which are then dispatched to registered handlers. Handlers are invoked directly with the sender and args, potentially executing malicious code if handlers are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. Usage of weak references and dynamic function handling is standard for observer patterns. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected. The code does not contain any suspicious network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard observer pattern supporting async and sync signals. It manages registered handlers, supports weak references to handlers to avoid memory leaks, and allows filtering based on sender objects. The only notable aspect is the use of weak references for handler management, which is common. There are no suspicious operations, external network calls, or hidden behaviors. The flow from external calls to handler invocation is straightforward, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a signal/observer system without malicious behavior. It relies on handlers supplied by external code, which could be malicious if handlers are malicious, but this is typical for callback systems. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are present within this module.",
