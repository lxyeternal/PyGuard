  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly describes the implementation of an observer pattern with support for async and sync signals, with data flowing from connect/send to handlers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code, credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.\n- **Conclusion**: The code is a standard signal pattern implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores**:\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly above zero, but justified given the potential for handlers to process untrusted data, which is outside this code's scope.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, no suspicious activity, and proper reference management.\n\n**Scores**:\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment**: Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on data flow and potential risks if handlers are malicious, but clarifies that no malicious code is embedded here.\n- Notes that handlers could be malicious, but this is outside the scope of this code.\n\n**Scores**:\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.2 — justified due to potential malicious handlers, but not from the code itself.\n\n**Assessment**: Well-reasoned; no malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard patterns, no network or system manipulations, and proper use of weak references.\n\n**Scores**:\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but acceptable given the context.\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is a standard observer pattern, with no malicious activity, external network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores**:\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.2 — justified for the same reasons as above.\n\n**Assessment**: Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score**: Slightly above zero (~0.1–0.2), justified because if handlers are malicious, they could execute harmful code, but this is outside the scope of this implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a signal/observer pattern.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- The only potential security concern is the registration of malicious handlers, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to potential misuse of handlers, but this is typical in callback systems.\n\n**Final note**: The code appears safe, well-implemented, and free of sabotage or malicious intent.",
