  "purpose": "Implementation of an observer pattern with support for synchronous and asynchronous signals.",
  "sources": "Input data from external callers invoking __call__ methods; potential user input via signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Signal handlers invoked in send methods; data flow from signal invocation to handler execution.",
  "flows": "External invocation -> unpack_sender_from_args -> iter_receivers -> call/await receiver with sender and args.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of weak references and dynamic handler connections are standard for event systems. No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious system modifications within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an observer pattern with support for both sync and async signals, managing receivers via weak references and filtering by sender. It uses standard Python features, including asyncio, weak references, and partial functions. No external inputs are processed beyond function calls. Signal handling and connection management are implemented using common patterns. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a typical implementation of an event system with proper handling of receiver references and sender filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a signal/observer pattern without any signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard Python features appropriately and maintains safety in reference handling. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
