{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the observer pattern supporting both synchronous and asynchronous signals, allowing registration, deregistration, and emission of signals to handlers.",
  "sources": "Connect method registers handlers; send/__call__ methods invoke handlers with sender and args; handlers may process untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Handlers invoked during signal emission, potentially processing untrusted data; no external network or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Signal emission calls handlers with sender and args; handlers execute, possibly malicious if registered maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; use of weak references is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured observer pattern supporting async and sync handlers. It manages references properly and does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The potential security concern is the registration of malicious handlers, which is outside the code scope. No external communication or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The implementation is a typical, safe observer pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent and justified given the context.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
