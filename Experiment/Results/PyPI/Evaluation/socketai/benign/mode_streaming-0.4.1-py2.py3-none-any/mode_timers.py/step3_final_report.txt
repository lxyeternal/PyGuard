{
  "purpose": "An asyncio-based timer class implementing drift correction and interval adjustments for precise periodic execution.",
  "sources": "Reads system clock via perf_counter, input parameters for interval, and internal state variables for timing calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data inputs; primarily logs internal timing metrics.",
  "flows": "Calculates sleep durations based on drift correction, updates internal timing states, and logs diagnostic information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asyncio timer with drift correction, logging, and interval adjustments. It uses standard modules and internal state management without external communication or malicious constructs. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The logic is consistent with typical timing utilities, and no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured asyncio timer utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and the reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
