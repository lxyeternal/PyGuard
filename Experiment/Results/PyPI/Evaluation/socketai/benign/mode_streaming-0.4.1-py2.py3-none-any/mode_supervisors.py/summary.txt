  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard supervisor implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the potential misuse of the 'replacement' callback extension point, which is a known and controlled feature. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in production environments, with minimal risk if external inputs are properly managed."
