  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'MaxRestartsExceeded' for signaling excessive restart attempts in a supervisor system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is static and defines a class and a list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely declares a class and a list without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class definition and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with a descriptive docstring and an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no input/output, no dynamic code, and no external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, minimal nature of the code. The code serves a clear purpose within a larger system without introducing any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Python exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
