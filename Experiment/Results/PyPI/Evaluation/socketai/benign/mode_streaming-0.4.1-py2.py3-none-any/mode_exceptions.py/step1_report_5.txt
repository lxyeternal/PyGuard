  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for indicating excessive restart attempts in a supervisor system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class 'MaxRestartsExceeded' with a corresponding string docstring. It uses standard Python syntax for class definition and exception inheritance. The __all__ list exposes the exception class for module import. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. The code appears to serve a specific purpose within a larger application to signal a particular error condition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any anomalies or suspicious behavior and is likely part of a larger, benign application.",
