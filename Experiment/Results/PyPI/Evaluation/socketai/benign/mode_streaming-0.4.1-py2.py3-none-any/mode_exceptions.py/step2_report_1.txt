  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward, standard Python class defining a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign and serves a specific purpose within a larger system.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any security concern that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely definitional, with no data handling, network activity, or other vectors for exploitation.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content, which is minimal and benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary and my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign exception class with no security implications. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI concur with the existing assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security risk or malicious threat.",
