  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code defines a simple custom exception class `MaxRestartsExceeded`.\n   - The class is used to signal that a supervisor has exceeded maximum restart attempts.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no input/output handling, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The `__all__` declaration correctly exposes the exception class for external use.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - None of the reports identify any malicious activity, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is typical for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Malware**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n4. **Risk and Obfuscated Scores**:\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**:\n   - The scores given (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is a minimal, standard exception class, there is no reason to assign higher risk scores.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code snippet does not pose security concerns.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
