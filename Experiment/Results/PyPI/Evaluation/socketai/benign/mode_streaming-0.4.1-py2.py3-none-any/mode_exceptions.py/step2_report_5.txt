  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code defines a simple custom exception class named `MaxRestartsExceeded`.\n   - The class is straightforward, with a descriptive docstring.\n   - The `__all__` list is used to specify public API exposure.\n   - No input/output handling, data processing, or external dependencies are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The summaries are thorough and aligned with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no malicious intent.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities; none are made.\n   - The reasoning is sound and based solely on static code analysis.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Given the absence of any malicious or obfuscated elements, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward Python module defining a custom exception class. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
