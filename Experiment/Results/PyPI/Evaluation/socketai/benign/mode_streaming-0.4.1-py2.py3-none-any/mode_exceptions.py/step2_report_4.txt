  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- The code simply defines a custom exception class `MaxRestartsExceeded` with a descriptive docstring and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code is minimal and straightforward, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n- The only potential concern could be if the exception class name or purpose is misleading, but the name and docstring are consistent and clear.\n\n3. Scores given:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence is high (1 or 1.0), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a high risk score; the code is purely definitional and does not perform any risky operations.\n- The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n5. Challenge assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the code's surface.\n\n6. Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign custom exception class.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely definitional, with no security concerns.",
