  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard Python class defining a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code is minimal and serves a clear purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely defining a custom exception with no external interactions, no input/output handling, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code's purpose is benign and straightforward.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal potential for misinterpretation but overall benign nature)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, perhaps with a very slight increase in the overall risk score (e.g., 0.1) to acknowledge that, while benign, the code could be misused if integrated into a malicious larger system—though this is a stretch given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
