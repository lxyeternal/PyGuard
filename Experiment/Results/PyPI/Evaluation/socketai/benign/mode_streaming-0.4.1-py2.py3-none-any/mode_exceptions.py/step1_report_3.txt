  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for signaling when a supervisor has exceeded maximum restart attempts.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines a class and a module-level list for exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class MaxRestartsExceeded, intended for signaling a specific condition related to service restarts. There are no input, output, or data processing operations; no use of environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, with a clear purpose, and adheres to standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception used for control flow in a larger system. There are no signs of malicious intent or security concerns within this snippet.",
