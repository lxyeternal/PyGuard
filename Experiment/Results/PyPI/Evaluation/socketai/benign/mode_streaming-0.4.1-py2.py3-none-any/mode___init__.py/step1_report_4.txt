{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that lazily loads various service, signal, supervisor, utility, and worker components for an async service-based framework, primarily for organizing and exporting functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes and imports components dynamically based on a predefined mapping ('all_by_module'). It also accesses the system modules via 'sys.modules' to replace the current module with a custom class.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations. The dynamic import and attribute access are based on predefined mappings and internal attributes, not user input.",
  "flows": "The module dynamically imports submodules when attributes are accessed, and the custom module class (__getattr__) retrieves attributes from imported modules. No external untrusted data is used in these flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic attribute access and module replacement, which are advanced features but are used here solely for lazy loading and organizational purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a structured, lazy-loaded module with controlled attribute access. It uses a mapping to import and assign submodule components dynamically. The custom _module class overrides __getattr__ to load modules only when needed, reducing initial load time. No data is read from external sources, and no untrusted input influences import or attribute resolution. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The overall design is consistent with standard advanced Python module patterns, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured setup for lazy loading module components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The dynamic import mechanisms are safely constrained by predefined mappings, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
