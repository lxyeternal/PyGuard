{
  "purpose": "Provides a modular, lazy-loading interface for an asyncio-based service framework, organizing components and deferring module loading until needed.",
  "sources": "Predefined mappings in 'all_by_module' dict, which specify module paths for each component; attribute access via __getattr__ that triggers dynamic import based on these mappings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, attribute access could lead to dynamic import of modules; however, since the mappings are static and controlled, untrusted data does not influence this process, minimizing risk.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__) checks if the name is in 'object_origins'; if so, imports the module specified in 'object_origins', then sets attributes for all items in that module as per 'all_by_module', returning the requested attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom ModuleType subclass with overridden __getattr__ and __dir__ methods; controlled dynamic import pattern; no external input influences module loading; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a controlled dynamic import mechanism via a custom module class, which loads submodules and exposes their attributes on demand. The mappings are static and predefined, preventing arbitrary code execution. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is common in large, modular Python packages to optimize load times and namespace management. The use of __getattr__ and __dir__ is safe here, given the controlled mappings. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured modular loader employing controlled dynamic attribute access. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The risk is minimal and justified by the controlled nature of the import mechanism.",
