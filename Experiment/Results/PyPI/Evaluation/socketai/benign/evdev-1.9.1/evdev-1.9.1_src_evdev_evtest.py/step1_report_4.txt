{
  "purpose": "The script is an input device event monitor that lists, selects, and displays input device events from Linux input subsystem devices.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function; reading device capabilities and properties; reading from stdin for device selection.",
  "sinks": "Printing event data and device info; no data is sent over the network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "User input (choices) → selection of devices → event reading and printing; no external data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of sys.exit(1) after error messages is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. The code interacts with system devices but within expected parameters for an input event monitor.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an input device monitoring utility, allowing device selection, capability listing, and event display. It uses standard Python modules and system calls to manage tty settings and select devices. There are no indications of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Input is from user prompts, and output is via standard printing. The logic appears straightforward and intended for device monitoring without any covert or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate input device event monitor intended for debugging or device inspection purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
