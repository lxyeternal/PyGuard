  "purpose": "A device enumerator and event monitor for Linux input devices, listing device info and reading input events.",
  "sources": "Device files in /dev/input, user input via input() prompts, standard system modules.",
  "sinks": "Console output of device info and events; no external network or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads device data and user choices, then outputs device info and event logs locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard device enumeration, capability listing, and event monitoring using well-known modules and practices. It reads device data, interacts with the terminal, and outputs information without any network activity or data exfiltration. No anomalies such as suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and it employs common techniques for device interaction and user input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Linux input device utility with no malicious intent or harmful behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical device interaction. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
