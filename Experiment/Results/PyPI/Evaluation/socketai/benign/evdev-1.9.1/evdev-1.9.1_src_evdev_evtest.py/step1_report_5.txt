{
  "purpose": "The script is an input device event monitor for Linux systems, allowing users to list devices, view capabilities, and listen for input events.",
  "sources": "Input data from user selections via 'input()' function; device paths from command-line arguments; sys.stdin for tty detection.",
  "sinks": "Printing device info, capabilities, events, and errors to stdout/stderr; calls to device.grab() which may affect device event handling.",
  "flows": "User input choices → selection of InputDevice objects → event reading in an infinite loop → event printing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Usage of 'input()' is straightforward and intended for device selection. No suspicious network or file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a device event listener, listing devices, capabilities, and monitoring events with user interaction. It uses standard libraries and device management functions without any dynamic code execution or external communication. No data exfiltration, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of 'atexit' for restoring tty settings and handling signals appears standard. Overall, the script is a legitimate utility for device monitoring without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical input device event monitor utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs device listing, capability reporting, and event monitoring in a safe manner, with no suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
