{
  "purpose": "Input device event monitoring and capability listing for input hardware via /dev/input devices.",
  "sources": "User input from stdin for device selection; reading device capabilities and input events from device files; system calls such as sys.stdin.isatty() and termios.tcgetattr/termios.tcsetattr.",
  "sinks": "Printing output to stdout; potential system calls via device methods (grab, capabilities, input_props).",
  "flows": "User input (device selection) flows to device instantiation; device capabilities and event reading flow to print functions; device event data flows from device.read() to print_event.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries for device monitoring. No network, file system modification, or suspicious process spawning detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an interface for listing, selecting, and monitoring input devices through standard system calls and libraries. It includes device capability querying, event listening, and terminal control for user experience. No malicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to device input monitoring. The code handles user input and device data securely, with no evident backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard input device event monitor with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily interacts with system hardware and outputs information. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
