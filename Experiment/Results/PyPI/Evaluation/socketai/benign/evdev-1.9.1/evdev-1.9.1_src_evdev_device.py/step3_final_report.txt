{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with Linux input devices, including retrieving device info, capabilities, and controlling device features such as LEDs and force feedback effects.",
  "sources": "Reads device info via ioctl calls, input properties, capabilities, and current device states (e.g., active keys, absinfo).",
  "sinks": "Uses ioctl calls to modify device state (e.g., set LEDs, upload/erase effects, set absinfo), but does not transmit data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Source data (device info, capabilities, input states) flows through ioctl calls; modifications (e.g., set_absinfo, set_led) send commands to device drivers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code structure is standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with hardware via standard system calls and ioctl interfaces, with proper error handling and resource management. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions serve legitimate device management purposes. The code is well-structured, readable, and relies on typical Linux input subsystem interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Linux input device interface module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical device interaction code.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
