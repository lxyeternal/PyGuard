  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The module exposes Linux input event constants, importing `_ecodes` and using `getmembers`. The description aligns with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or commands are processed or sent; data flows are internal and static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The dynamic manipulation of `globals()` and dictionary updates are typical for such mapping modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a standard, safe mapping module is accurate. Confidence is high (1), malware is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with consistent description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of dynamic attribute extraction and cleanup via `del` is standard for such modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as a benign, utility mapping module. Confidence is high (0.9), malware is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or command executions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior; cleanup via `del` is normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is correct; the code is a static mapping setup with no security concerns. Confidence is high (1), malware is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The dynamic generation of mappings and global modifications are typical for such modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a benign constants utility. Confidence is high (1), malware is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, consistent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, just static data organization.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment; safe, standard mapping code. Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward constants mapping module for Linux input event codes.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, well-understood utility module for input event code mappings, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores reflect this correctly.",
