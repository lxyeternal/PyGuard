  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues identified are valid, consistent, and if the scoring aligns with the observed code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The module imports constants from an internal `_ecodes` module.\n- Uses `inspect.getmembers()` to retrieve all attributes.\n- Categorizes constants based on prefixes (`KEY`, `ABS`, `REL`, etc.).\n- Builds forward and reverse mappings between names and values.\n- Converts lists to tuples for immutability.\n- Cleans up temporary variables.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- Purpose is purely to organize constants for input event handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of Issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and does not contain malicious behavior. They consistently mention no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.  \n  **Yes, the issues are valid:** the code is a standard constants mapping module.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are noted. The logic is clear, and the code performs its intended purpose without issues.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious behavior, no code injection, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious activity. This aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nAll agree on 0, as the code is transparent, uses no obfuscation techniques, and is straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nMost reports assign 0 or 0.1, indicating negligible security risk. Given the code's purpose and behavior, a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.2) could be justified if considering the dynamic manipulation of globals and the deletion of variables, but these are common in such mapping modules.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- The code dynamically creates mappings but does not execute untrusted code or handle external input.\n- The deletion of variables at the end is a cleanup step, not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no code injection.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal complexity but no real security concern)\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is a benign utility module for mapping constants. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, safe, and static mapping utility for Linux input event codes. The assigned scores are reasonable, with perhaps a slight adjustment to the security risk score to 0.1 to acknowledge the dynamic code aspects but still reflect negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its purpose.",
