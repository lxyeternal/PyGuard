{
  "purpose": "This module exposes and organizes Linux input event code constants for use in input device handling, providing mappings between names and values.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'evdev._ecodes' module, uses 'getmembers' from 'inspect' to retrieve constants from '_ecodes'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data flows to external systems, no data leaks or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves constants from a source module, processes and categorizes them into dictionaries, then deletes temporary variables; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs dynamic attribute extraction and manipulation of constants, but no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. Use of 'del' to remove variables appears benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads constants from an internal module '_ecodes', categorizes them into mappings based on prefixes, and constructs reverse mappings for constants. It also combines key codes into a 'keys' dictionary and cleans up temporary variables. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code is mainly for organizing constants and providing utility mappings for input event codes. The use of 'getmembers' and dynamic dictionary updates is standard for such a module. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for handling Linux input event codes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a structured constant mapping provider without external side effects.",
