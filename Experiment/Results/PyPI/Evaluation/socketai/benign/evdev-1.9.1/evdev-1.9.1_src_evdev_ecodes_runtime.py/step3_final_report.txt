{
  "purpose": "This module exposes Linux input event constants and provides mappings between their names and values, facilitating input device event handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute definitions from the internal _ecodes module using inspect.getmembers() and processes these into dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data inputs or outputs; the code only manipulates internal data structures.",
  "flows": "The code extracts constants, categorizes them by prefix, and builds forward and reverse mappings within the global namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; dynamic globals manipulation and cleanup are standard for such mapping modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward utility for organizing constants related to Linux input events. It uses introspection to generate mappings, then cleans up temporary variables. No external data, network activity, or code execution occurs. The logic is clear, and no malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard constants mapping module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
