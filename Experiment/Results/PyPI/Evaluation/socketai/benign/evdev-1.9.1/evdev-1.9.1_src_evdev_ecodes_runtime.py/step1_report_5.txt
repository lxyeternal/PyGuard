{
  "purpose": "To expose and organize Linux input event constants and their mappings for use in input device handling.",
  "sources": "Reading constants from the internal module `_ecodes`, and accessing its members via `getmembers`.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data is being written to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Extraction of constants from `_ecodes`, organizing into dictionaries, and mapping values to names and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code mostly performs static data organization. It dynamically constructs mappings from an internal module but does not include any network or file I/O. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal constants from `_ecodes` and dynamically creates mappings of event code names to values and vice versa, for various input event types. It uses `getmembers` to introspect `_ecodes`, filters by specific prefixes, and organizes the data into dictionaries. The code performs standard module setup for input event code handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data manipulation. There are no external communications, no obfuscation, and no suspicious file or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static data mapping module for Linux input event constants. It is designed solely for input event code organization and access. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
