{
  "purpose": "The module exposes Linux input event code constants and their mappings for use in evdev-related applications, providing reverse and forward mappings for key codes and event types.",
  "sources": "Import of internal _ecodes module, getmembers from inspect, and the globals() dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed from external untrusted sources or sent to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "The code extracts constants from _ecodes, populates mappings, and updates dictionaries with key-value pairs based on prefix matching and reverse mapping logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is focused on mapping definitions and data structure organization. The dynamic modification of globals() and the removal of certain keys from 'keys' are normal for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and processes constants from the _ecodes module, creating dictionaries for forward and reverse mappings. It groups constants by prefixes, converts list values to tuples for immutability, and constructs a combined keys dictionary. The logic is straightforward and intended for constant mapping. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or secret exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dynamic use of globals() and manipulation of internal dictionaries are typical for such mapping modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mapping module for Linux input event codes. It performs no malicious actions, contains no suspicious code or data leaks, and appears safe. It simply organizes and exposes constants for external use.",
