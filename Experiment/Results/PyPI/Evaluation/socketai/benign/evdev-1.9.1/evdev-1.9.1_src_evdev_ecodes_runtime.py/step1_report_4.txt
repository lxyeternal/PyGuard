{
  "purpose": "To expose and organize Linux input event code constants for use in input device handling, mapping names to values and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The module imports _ecodes and uses getmembers(_ecodes) to read all attributes from it.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly reads constants and populates mappings.",
  "flows": "The code reads from _ecodes, processes the constants, and populates global dictionaries and mappings; no external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically generates mappings and modifies globals, which is complex but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation or runtime code execution techniques are used.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a module, extracts constants with getmembers, and organizes them into dictionaries and reverse mappings. It processes prefixes to categorize constants, converts lists to tuples for immutability, and constructs combined key dictionaries. The code cleans up by deleting temporary variables at the end. No external inputs, network calls, or potentially malicious code is present. The purpose is purely to define constants and mappings for input event codes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward constants mapping utility for Linux input event codes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The dynamic attribute processing and global modifications are typical for such mapping code and do not raise security concerns.",
