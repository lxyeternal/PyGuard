{
  "purpose": "The script generates Python code that maps constant names to their values from the 'ecodes' module and prints structured data for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'ecodes' module, specifically 'ecodes.ecodes' and various dictionaries like 'ecodes.KEY', 'ecodes.ABS', etc.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the generated code and data structures to standard output (print statements).",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'ecodes' module to local variables and then is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'evdev.ecodes' is mocked, and no malicious code is evident. The code simply maps and prints data; there are no suspicious code injections, network communications, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by mocking 'evdev.ecodes' to prevent actual module loading, then imports 'ecodes_runtime' as 'ecodes'. It proceeds to print documentation and generate constant definitions from 'ecodes.ecodes'. It then iterates over a list of predefined dictionaries within 'ecodes', printing their contents in a formatted manner. The code is straightforward, performing data extraction and printing with no external side effects, external data manipulation, or malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code's purpose appears to be for generating code or documentation based on 'evdev' key mappings, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily performing data extraction and printing for documentation or code generation purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
