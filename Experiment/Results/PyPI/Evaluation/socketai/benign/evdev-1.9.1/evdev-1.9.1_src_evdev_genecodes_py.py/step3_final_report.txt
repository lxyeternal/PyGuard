{
  "purpose": "Generate Python code mapping 'evdev.ecodes' constants and dictionaries for documentation or code generation purposes.",
  "sources": "Data read from 'evdev.ecodes' module, specifically 'ecodes' attribute and related dictionaries like 'KEY', 'ABS', etc., from the mocked 'evdev.ecodes'.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via print statements, producing Python code snippets and documentation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'ecodes' module (mocked or real) into printed code snippets, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mocking 'evdev.ecodes' indicates this is a testing or code generation environment; no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and mocks 'evdev.ecodes', then prints documentation, constants, and dictionaries derived from 'ecodes'. The mocking is standard for testing or documentation purposes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, intended for generating code or documentation, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context. The overall behavior is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for generating Python code from 'evdev' key mappings. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of mocking is typical for testing or documentation, not malicious sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0.",
