{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures for force-feedback effects using ctypes, likely for interaction with hardware or drivers.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code reads only from internal definitions and structure initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data is sent over network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to structure definitions and internal memory handling; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. All structures are standard for hardware control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various ctypes.Structure classes for force-feedback effects such as Constant, Ramp, Periodic, Condition, and Rumble, along with related trigger, replay, envelope, and effect union structures. No external input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure declaration for hardware interaction with no malicious behavior or obfuscation evident. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of data structures for force-feedback effects, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be standard hardware interface definitions without any malicious or obfuscated components.",
