{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for force-feedback effects and input/output operations in a hardware control library.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ctypes' and a local module '.ecodes'; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data handling are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "The code only defines data structures; there are no executable flows or data processing paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes ctypes-based structures to represent various force-feedback effect parameters, such as envelopes, conditions, periodic effects, and effects themselves. It appears to be a straightforward data definition module for a force-feedback input system, with no input handling, network communication, or execution logic. The structures are used to encapsulate parameters for hardware effects, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. The only external interaction is through the imported 'ctypes' and '.ecodes', which are standard and contextually appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure definition for a force-feedback input device interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code serves purely as a data schema with no executable or external data handling components.",
