  "purpose": "Define data structures for force-feedback effects used in joystick or game controller hardware interfacing.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; this is a data structure definition module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely straightforward data structure definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The commented-out 'ff_types' dictionary could be relevant in context, but as-is, it’s inactive and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ctypes structures for various force-feedback effect parameters, such as Replay, Trigger, Envelope, Constant, Ramp, Condition, Periodic, Rumble, EffectType, and Effect. These structures are used for interfacing with hardware drivers or APIs, with no indications of malicious behavior or external data handling. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execution of untrusted data. It appears to be a standard hardware interface data schema, with no signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard definition of data structures for force-feedback effects in hardware interfaces. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low.",
