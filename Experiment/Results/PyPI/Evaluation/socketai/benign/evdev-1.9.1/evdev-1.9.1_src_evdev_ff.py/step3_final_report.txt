  "purpose": "Defines data structures for hardware force-feedback effects, including parameters for effects, triggers, envelopes, and related configurations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static structure definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; purely data structure declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out 'ff_types' dictionary, which is inactive and harmless; no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of ctypes structure definitions for force-feedback effects, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structures are standard for hardware interaction, and no malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as a data schema for device effects, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard hardware interface definition for force-feedback effects. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no revisions are necessary.",
