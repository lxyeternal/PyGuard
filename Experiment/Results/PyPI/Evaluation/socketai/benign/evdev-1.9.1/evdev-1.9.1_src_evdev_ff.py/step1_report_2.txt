{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for force-feedback effects used in a device input handling library, including effect parameters, triggers, envelopes, and effect management structures.",
  "sources": "Importing 'ctypes' and local module '.ecodes'. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output functions are present. No network, file, or environment variable operations are included.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines data structures without dynamic data handling or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of ctypes for defining C-like structures, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are visible. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward translation of device effect parameters into ctypes structures, with no evident malicious logic. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard hardware interface definition. The only external dependency is the 'ctypes' library and a local 'ecodes' module, both standard or presumably benign. There are no anomalies or signs of tampering. The code does not perform any data manipulation, validation, or processing that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a data structure definition module for force-feedback effects, with no indication of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, purely structural implementation for hardware interaction.",
