{
  "purpose": "The script reads Linux header files to extract macro definitions matching specific prefixes and generates either a Python extension module or stub definitions based on command-line options.",
  "sources": "Header files specified via command-line arguments or defaults; system info via os.uname()",
  "sinks": "Generated code snippets with macro constants, written to stdout",
  "flows": "Reads header files, applies regex to extract macros, formats macros into code templates",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; use of os.uname() is benign metadata collection",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reading, regex-based macro extraction, and code generation. It uses standard modules and practices, with no network activity or dynamic code execution. The macro extraction is straightforward, and the output is controlled. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, safe utility for generating Python bindings from Linux input headers. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal, primarily related to trusting external header files, which is typical for such tools.",
