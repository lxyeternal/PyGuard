{
  "purpose": "Generate Python extension module or stubs with constants defined in linux/input.h by parsing specified header files.",
  "sources": "sys.argv input arguments, file reads from specified header files, os.uname() call for system info",
  "sinks": "None directly; output is code generation based on parsed header macros, no untrusted data execution",
  "flows": "Input arguments → file reading in parse_headers() → macro extraction → code template formatting and output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard file parsing and code generation.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input arguments for header files, processes header files to extract macro definitions matching specific patterns, and generates C/Python extension code or stubs based on options. The use of regular expressions for macro extraction and file I/O are typical. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a legitimate code generation utility for input device constants, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward code generator for Linux input device macros, with no malicious behavior detected. It securely processes header files and outputs formatted code without any malicious side effects.",
