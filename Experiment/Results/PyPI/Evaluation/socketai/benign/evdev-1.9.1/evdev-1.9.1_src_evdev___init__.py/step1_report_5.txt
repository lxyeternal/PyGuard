{
  "purpose": "The code organizes and imports various modules and classes into a single namespace for easier access within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and specific classes or functions from relative package paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data output, no external connections, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports modules and defines namespace structure for a Python package. It includes comments about mypy compliance and uses standard import syntax. No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure appears typical for package organization. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and namespace organization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
