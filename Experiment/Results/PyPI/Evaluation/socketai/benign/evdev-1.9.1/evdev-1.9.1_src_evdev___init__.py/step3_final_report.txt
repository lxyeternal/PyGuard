  "purpose": "Organize and consolidate internal modules and classes into a single namespace for easier access and type checking.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules and classes, with comments explaining import syntax choices.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only performs static imports for namespace management.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import module as module' syntax to satisfy mypy, which is a benign pattern; no obfuscation or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static import aggregation with comments explaining the import syntax for type checking. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no suspicious patterns or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace import module with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
