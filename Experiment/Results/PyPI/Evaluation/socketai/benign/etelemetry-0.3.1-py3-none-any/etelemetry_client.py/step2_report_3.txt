  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward version management utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. It uses standard practices like delayed import, environment variable checks, version comparison, and logging.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity detected. The security risk score of 0.2 seems conservative, considering no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard version management, environment variable control, and safe network requests. No malicious behavior identified.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical version check utility, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard version check code, no malicious behavior, with proper error handling and logging.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a benign version check utility, with no suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is clean, well-structured, and performs standard version management tasks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - Malware: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk from network requests and environment variable controls, but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The only slight concern is the dynamic import of 'requests' and 'ci_info', but this is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly avoid speculation.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | **0**       |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**       |\n| Security Risk    | **0.2**     |\n\nThe code is a standard, safe version management utility with no malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
