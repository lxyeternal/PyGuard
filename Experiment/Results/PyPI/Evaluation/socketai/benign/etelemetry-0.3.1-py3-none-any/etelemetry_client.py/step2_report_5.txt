  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a version management utility, fetching project info via network requests, comparing versions, and logging or raising errors.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network endpoints are present.\n- The dynamic import of 'requests' and 'ci_info' is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not malicious obfuscation.\n- Environment variable 'NO_ET' is used to disable network requests, a typical pattern.\n- Version comparison uses the 'packaging.version.Version' class, which is standard.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code is evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk is low (~0.2), aligned with standard version-checking code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code appears clean; no vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n- The only minor concern is the use of environment variables to control behavior, but this is standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The `_available_version_checked` global variable is used to cache the latest version info. This is acceptable but could lead to stale data if the environment or server state changes during runtime. However, this is a typical optimization and not a critical flaw.\n- The code does not handle the case where `res.json()` might not contain the expected keys (`version`, `bad_versions`). If the server response is malformed, it could raise an exception, but this is not a security issue per se.\n- The import fallback for `ci_info` is benign but could potentially cause issues if the deprecated `ci` module behaves differently. Still, not malicious.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a low score (~0.2) seems appropriate, as indicated by the reports.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — low, typical for version management utilities, no significant security concern.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's purpose and implementation are standard.\n- No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The environment variable controls behavior but does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
