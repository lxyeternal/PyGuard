  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a version checking utility with environment variable control, network requests, and version comparison.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Uses standard practices like delayed import, error handling, logging.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the functionality.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on version management and environment info.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Checks project versions, handles network errors, logs info.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Fetches project version info, compares versions, logs or raises errors.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is a typical version checker.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar version fetching and comparison, with environment variable control.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** The low scores (~0.2) are justified given the code's functionality—standard version management with network requests and environment controls.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, due to network operations and environment variable controls, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard version management utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The reported scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.",
