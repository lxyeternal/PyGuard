{
  "purpose": "To generate and provide version metadata information about the source code or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads embedded JSON string 'version_json' which contains version metadata.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' function processes the JSON string; no untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "The code loads a static JSON string into a Python dictionary via 'json.loads'. No data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; it does not perform any unusual actions, dynamic code execution, or use of obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a JSON string with version details and a function that loads this string into a Python dictionary. The JSON data appears static and pre-generated, originating from version control metadata. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code simply processes embedded static data, which is standard in version management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple static JSON parse for version info with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
