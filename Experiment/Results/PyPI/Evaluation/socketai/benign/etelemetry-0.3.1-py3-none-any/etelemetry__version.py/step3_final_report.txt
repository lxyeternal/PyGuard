  "purpose": "Static version metadata loader that parses embedded JSON string containing version info.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string 'version_json' embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function parsing the static JSON; no untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The function get_versions() reads the static JSON string and returns its parsed dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and generated by a version control utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string with version info, then parses it with json.loads() in get_versions(). No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The JSON data contains only version metadata with no secrets or malicious payloads. The code is generated by 'versioneer.py' and serves a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, static, and benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
