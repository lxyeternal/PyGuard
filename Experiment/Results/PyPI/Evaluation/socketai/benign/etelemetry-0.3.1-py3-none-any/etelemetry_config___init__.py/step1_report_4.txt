  "purpose": "Constructs URLs for an ET (possibly 'extraction tool') service based on hostname and protocol preferences.",
  "sources": "hostname variable, https boolean flag",
  "sinks": "String formatting for URLs, concatenation to create ET_ROOT and ET_PROJECTS URLs",
  "flows": "hostname and https input -> URL prefix determination -> URL string formatting and concatenation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed; code uses simple variable assignments and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static hostname and protocol choice, then constructs URL strings accordingly. No user input, network access, or secret handling is present. The URL construction appears standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, intended for URL generation based on fixed parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple URL construction logic with static parameters and no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
