  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe static, hardcoded hostname and protocol flags.\n- The code is straightforward URL construction with no user input, external data, or dynamic execution.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent is evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which seems appropriate given the static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; variables are hardcoded.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — reasonable.\n- **Potential issues:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same conclusions; straightforward URL setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — justified.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar reasoning; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same as others; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues found; all reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is static and does not process external or user data.\n- If future modifications introduce dynamic inputs or external data, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n- The current scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, safe URL construction snippet with no security concerns.",
