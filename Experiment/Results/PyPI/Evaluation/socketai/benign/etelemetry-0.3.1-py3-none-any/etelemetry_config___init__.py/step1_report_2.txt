  "purpose": "Constructs URLs based on a hostname and protocol setting for accessing ET (presumably some service) resources.",
  "sources": "Variables hostname and https, used to determine protocol and base URL.",
  "sinks": "Format string constructing URLs; no direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "hostname and https determine prefix, which is combined into URLs; no external input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious variables or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static hostname and protocol boolean, then constructs URL strings using straightforward string formatting. There are no inputs from users, no external data sources, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The URL construction is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple URL template setup with hardcoded values, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
