  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a straightforward URL construction using hardcoded hostname and protocol flag.\n- No external inputs, dynamic data, or network activity are involved.\n- All reports conclude the code is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \nYes. The reports correctly identify that the code is static, simple URL construction with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \nNo. The reports accurately describe the code's behavior and security posture. They correctly state that there are no dynamic inputs, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — appropriate, as code is straightforward.  \n- *Malware:* 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0 — appropriate, no vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nNone. The code is static and safe; thus, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \nCorrectly set to 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe static URL construction.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**  \nScores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a static URL generator with hardcoded hostname and protocol flag, entirely safe and without malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
