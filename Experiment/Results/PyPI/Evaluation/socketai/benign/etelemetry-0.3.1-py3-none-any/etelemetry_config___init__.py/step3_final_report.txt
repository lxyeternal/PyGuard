{
  "purpose": "Constructs URLs based on static hostname and protocol flag for internal configuration or resource referencing.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded hostname ('rig.mit.edu') and boolean flag ('https') used to determine URL prefix.",
  "sinks": "Generated URL strings ('ET_ROOT' and 'ET_PROJECTS') for further use or network requests.",
  "flows": "Variables 'hostname' and 'https' determine 'prefix', which formats into URL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, hardcoded values are static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static variables for hostname and protocol, then constructs URL strings via string formatting. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple, with clear intent for URL configuration. No malicious or security-compromising operations are evident. The code's static nature and lack of external data make it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static URL generator with hardcoded hostname and protocol flag, entirely safe and without malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
