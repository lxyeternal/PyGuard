  "purpose": "Define base URLs for accessing project resources over HTTP or HTTPS based on configuration",
  "sources": "Variables 'hostname', 'https', and 'prefix' used to construct URLs",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output or data transmission code present",
  "flows": "Uses 'https' boolean to select protocol, then formats 'ET_ROOT' and 'ET_PROJECTS' URLs",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward URL construction without embedded secrets or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code initializes hostname and protocol preference. It conditionally sets the URL prefix based on the 'https' flag, then constructs base URLs for accessing project data. No untrusted input, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs simple string formatting for URL generation, typical in configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only constructs URLs based on predefined variables without external input or dangerous operations.",
