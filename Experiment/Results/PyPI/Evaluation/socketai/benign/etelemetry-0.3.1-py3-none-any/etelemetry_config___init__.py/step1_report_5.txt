  "sources": "Hostname and https variable; formatted URL string.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data usage detected.",
  "flows": "Hostname and https variable determine prefix; formatted strings generate URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses straightforward URL formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a hostname and protocol (https by default). It constructs base URLs using string formatting, which is standard. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic present. The code appears to be a simple configuration snippet for URL generation, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard URL construction based on predefined variables without any malicious behavior or security issues. It is a simple configuration setup with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
