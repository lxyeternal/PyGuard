  "purpose": "Define URL prefixes and construct base URLs for project-related resources.",
  "sources": "Hostname and https flag variables, which are hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The formatted URL strings, which could be used for network requests or resource access.",
  "flows": "The hostname and https flag are used to create the ET_ROOT URL, which then is combined with project-specific paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded hostname and protocol flag, but no unusual or suspicious behavior is present. No user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a hostname and a boolean indicating HTTPS usage. Based on the flag, it assigns a URL prefix. It then constructs a base URL (ET_ROOT) and a project URL template (ET_PROJECTS). All variables are statically assigned; there are no dynamic or external inputs, no sensitive data handling, and no network activity. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple URL construction snippet with hardcoded values. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The design is minimal and safe.",
