{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from local modules to define the package's version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from .client module: get_project, check_available_version, BadVersionError; import from . _version to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no output or data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The version assignment appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports and sets a version string using a function call. The imports are relative and typical for package internal organization. The version information is retrieved from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious activity. The structure is straightforward, and no external or untrusted input handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
