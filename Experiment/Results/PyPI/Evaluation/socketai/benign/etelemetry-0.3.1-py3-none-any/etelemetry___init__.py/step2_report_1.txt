  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as standard package initialization code, involving imports from internal modules and setting a version string.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Standard imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward import and version assignment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), assigns a small security risk (0.1), but no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The minimal security risk score seems to be an overestimation. Since the code only imports internal modules and retrieves version info, there's no actual security concern. The low confidence suggests some uncertainty, but the assigned risk appears inflated. I would recommend setting `securityRisk=0` for this code.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign version management code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only questionable point is Report 4's assigned `securityRisk=0.1`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external or dynamic data handling, this risk score should be 0.\n\n### **Malware score considerations:**\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is accurate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### **Obfuscated score considerations:**\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The scores for all reports are reasonable, except for Report 4's `securityRisk` which should be lowered to 0.\n- Given the code's simplicity, I would also assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0` uniformly.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard package initialization, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed except adjusting Report 4's `securityRisk` to 0.",
