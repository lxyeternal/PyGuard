  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, performing internal imports and version retrieval.\n- No external data, untrusted input, or network activity is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard package initialization code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the original code snippet exactly.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; all reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also very low or zero, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security concern that warrants a higher risk score.\n- The highest security risk score is 0.1, which is still very low and justified given the benign code.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code only performs static imports and version retrieval.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is standard and safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the straightforward, benign nature of this code, I concur with the reports' assessments. I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a typical package initialization segment with no security issues. All scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
