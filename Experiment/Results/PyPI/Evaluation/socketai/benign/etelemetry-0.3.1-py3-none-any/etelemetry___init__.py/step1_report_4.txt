{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a module and retrieves the package version, likely for version management or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.client' module and '_version' module to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and retrieves version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward imports and version retrieval. It does not execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The only potential concern is reliance on internal modules, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues in these operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly managing module imports and version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
