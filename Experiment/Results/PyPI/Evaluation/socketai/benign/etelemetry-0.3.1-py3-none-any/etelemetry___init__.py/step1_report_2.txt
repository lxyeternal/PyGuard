  "sources": "Import statements: from .client and from . import _version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static imports and attribute access",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import operations of functions and variables from internal modules, and assigns a version string from a version management module. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication is present. The code appears standard and follows typical package structure conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import and version assignment block with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
