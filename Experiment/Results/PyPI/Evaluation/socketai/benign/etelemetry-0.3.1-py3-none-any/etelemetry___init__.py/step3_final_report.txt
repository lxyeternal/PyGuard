  "purpose": "Standard package initialization code importing functions from internal modules and setting the version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from .client and ._version modules, and version retrieval via _version.get_versions()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment, with no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version setting, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple internal imports and assigns a version string, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It is a typical package setup snippet. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard package initialization. All reports correctly identify this, with only minor overestimation of security risk in one report. The overall security and malware scores should be set to 0, reflecting the absence of malicious activity or security concerns.",
