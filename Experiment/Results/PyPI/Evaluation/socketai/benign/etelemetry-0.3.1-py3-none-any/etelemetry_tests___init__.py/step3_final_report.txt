{
  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code features for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import statements, eval() usage, environment variables, user inputs, standard library imports",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, environment variables, file operations",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() and dynamic imports could lead to code execution; environment variables and inputs may influence system or network operations",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() and dynamic import statements, which are potential security concerns but not necessarily malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions with some dynamic features like eval() and dynamic imports. No evidence of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network-based malware. The use of eval() and dynamic imports introduces potential risks but no active malicious activity is observed. The code reads environment variables and user inputs but does not perform harmful operations. The overall structure is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports reflect a cautious stance, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and low security risk scores (0.2-0.3) due to dynamic features. The confidence levels are moderate to high, consistent with the evidence. The assessments are justified and align with best practices for supply chain security review.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The presence of eval() and dynamic imports warrants a slightly elevated security risk score but does not justify higher malware or obfuscation scores. Overall, the dependency appears benign with low security risk, and the assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
