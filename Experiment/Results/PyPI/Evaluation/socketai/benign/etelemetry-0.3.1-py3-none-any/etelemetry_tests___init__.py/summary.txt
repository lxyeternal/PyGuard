  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The presence of eval() and dynamic imports warrants a slightly elevated security risk score but does not justify higher malware or obfuscation scores. Overall, the dependency appears benign with low security risk, and the assessments across reports are consistent and justified."
