  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely metadata: comments, license info, version string.\n- No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the snippet.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippet.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No logical flaws are evident; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Score appropriateness:**\n  - *Malware:* All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n  - *Obfuscated:* All assign 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated comments and static version string.\n  - *Security risk:* All assign 0, as there's no active code or data handling.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No higher risk scores are warranted here, as the code is purely metadata with no security implications.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention the absence of data sources, sinks, or flows, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear comments and static string)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no executable code or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** They correctly identify this code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions. The code snippet is a standard license and version header with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
