  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or license comment for a software component, indicating licensing details, copyright, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the comments at the beginning of the file, which do not execute any code or process data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or execution points that handle untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as this is purely metadata and comments with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present; only licensing comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comment blocks detailing licensing, copyright, and version info, along with a version assignment statement. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling. No source or sink points are identified, and the code appears to be standard licensing boilerplate. The version string is static and hardcoded. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard license header and version indicator with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as metadata only.",
