  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata: comments, license info, copyright, and a static version string.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, or sources/sinks involved.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate, common in open-source projects, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Malware and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n3. **Security Risks:**\n   - Given the absence of executable code, data handling, or network interactions, the security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The reports' conclusions about benign nature are justified.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - The confidence score of 1 across all reports is reasonable, as the analysis is straightforward and based on the clear absence of suspicious elements.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Risks:**\n   - Since the code is only metadata, there is no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary or supported.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard license and version info.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I agree with all the given scores and conclusions.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a typical, safe header snippet with no security concerns.",
