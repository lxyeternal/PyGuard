It lacks sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited or indicate malicious activity. Given the limited content, there are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\nThe code does not include any network connections, data handling, or executable statements. It is a standard header found in many open-source or licensed files.\n\nOverall, this fragment alone does not show any malicious intent or security risks.",
