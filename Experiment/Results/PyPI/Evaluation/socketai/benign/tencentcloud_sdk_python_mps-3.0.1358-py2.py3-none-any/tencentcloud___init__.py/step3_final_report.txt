  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a header containing licensing information, copyright notices, and a static version string, primarily for documentation and version tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from comments and static string assignment (the __version__ variable).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a static version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license and version header with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are needed; the code is benign.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
