  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function, but without the actual code, it's unclear what that function is.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user inputs, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include database queries, system commands, network communications, or sensitive data handling points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various processing steps to sinks, possibly involving data transformations or validations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code behaviors include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated or complex code patterns, dynamic code execution, or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "Without the explicit code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Generally, review involves checking for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, insecure data handling, and obfuscation. Given the absence of the actual code, no specific anomalies are identified. The structure and content need to be examined to ensure no malicious logic is embedded.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to definitively identify malicious behavior without actual code content. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident based solely on code structure. Recommend further review with actual source code for detailed assessment.",
