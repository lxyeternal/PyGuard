  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a module designed for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user inputs via function arguments, and possibly external data sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file operations, or data outputs, especially if untrusted data is used directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input parameters to sinks such as network calls, file writes, or output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or suspicious function names. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data and processes it through functions without evident malicious or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or code injection. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no risky operations are apparent. The overall structure appears normal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for typical utility or processing modules.",
