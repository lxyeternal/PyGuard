  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are generally accurate and justified given the incomplete or absent code. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. Slightly lowering the risk score for Report 3 enhances consistency with the lack of concrete issues. The overall security posture appears benign, but ongoing review is recommended when more code details are available."
