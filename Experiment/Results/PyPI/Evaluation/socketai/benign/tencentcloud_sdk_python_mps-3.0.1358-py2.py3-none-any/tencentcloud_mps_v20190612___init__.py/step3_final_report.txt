  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Incomplete code snippets, potential use of eval/exec, reliance on environment variables, lack of concrete evidence of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack complete code, limiting definitive conclusions. Reports 1 and 4 show benign patterns with no signs of malicious activity, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks (0.2-0.3). Reports 2 and 5 have no code, correctly scored as zero across metrics. Report 3, with no code but mentioning potential issues, assigns a slightly higher risk (0.25); however, given the absence of evidence, a lower risk score of 0.1 is more appropriate. Confidence levels are moderate to high based on available data. Obfuscation is not indicated in any report. Overall, scores are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments suggested for Report 3's risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are generally accurate and justified given the incomplete or absent code. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. Slightly lowering the risk score for Report 3 enhances consistency with the lack of concrete issues. The overall security posture appears benign, but ongoing review is recommended when more code details are available.",
