{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a series of constant string error codes and messages related to various operational failures, internal errors, invalid parameters, resource not found, and unauthorized actions within a Tencent cloud service SDK or API.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string assignments representing error codes and messages; no input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present. The code solely defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as this is a static definition of constants without runtime data handling or logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. The structure is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string constants for error codes used in an SDK or API, with licensing comments and no logic, data processing, or input handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. It serves as a static reference for error handling and does not include any code that could harm or leak data. All content appears legitimate and standard for a cloud SDK.\n\nThe presence of only constant definitions and licensing information indicates no malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations are present. The code structure is clean, with no obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of constant error code definitions for a cloud SDK or API, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is benign and solely for error handling purposes.",
