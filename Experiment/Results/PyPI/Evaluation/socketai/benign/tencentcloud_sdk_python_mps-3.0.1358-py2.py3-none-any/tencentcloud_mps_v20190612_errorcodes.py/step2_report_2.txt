  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code content carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a large collection of constant string definitions representing error and status codes.\n- It includes licensing comments and categorizes errors related to parameters, internal errors, resource issues, and more.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code.\n- The code appears to be part of an SDK or API response standardization.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code contains no executable logic, no data flows, and no external interactions.\n- It is purely a static declaration of constants.\n- **No issues or malicious behavior are evident.**\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The comments and licensing are standard.\n- **No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.**\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0.\n- This aligns with the analysis, as the code is just constants.\n- **Scores seem reasonable and consistent.**\n\n### Step 4: Justify higher risk scores\n- Since the code is purely static constants, there is no reason to assign a risk higher than 0.\n- The malware score should be 0 because there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- The obfuscation score should be 0 because there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is also 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- All assumptions in the reports are correct; the code does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No hidden or malicious logic is present.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, static set of error code constants. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context where such constants are used. If the surrounding code or package includes dynamic or executable components, further review might be necessary. But based solely on this fragment, it is safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.",
