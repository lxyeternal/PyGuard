{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant string error and status codes used for error handling and messaging within a cloud SDK or API, facilitating standardized responses and debugging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the static definitions of error code strings; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities; the code only contains constant string assignments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or dynamic execution paths; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a minor typo in one error code string ('FailedOperation.CosStatusInavlid' instead of 'Invalid'), but this is a string value typo, not a logical flaw or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string constants representing error codes and messages, with licensing comments. It does not include functions, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only issue is a minor typo in an error code string. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a standard set of error code definitions for an SDK or API. It contains no malicious or obfuscated content, and the current scores accurately reflect its safety. The minor typo does not impact security or functionality.",
