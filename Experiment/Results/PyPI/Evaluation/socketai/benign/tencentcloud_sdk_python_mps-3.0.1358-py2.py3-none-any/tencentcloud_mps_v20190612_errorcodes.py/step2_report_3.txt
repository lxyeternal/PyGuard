  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a static collection of string constants representing error codes and messages for a cloud SDK or API, with extensive licensing comments. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code is purely declarative—constant definitions with no dynamic logic, data processing, or external interactions. No issues are identified or reported.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are noted. The only minor point is a typo in one error code: `'FailedOperation.CosStatusInavlid'` (should likely be `'Invalid'`), but this is a trivial typo and not a security concern.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risks as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  Given the code's static, constant-only nature, these scores are appropriately zero. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The code only defines constants; it does not process or handle data. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The assigned scores align with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Typos or minor issues:**  \n  The only noticeable issue is the typo `'FailedOperation.CosStatusInavlid'`. While this doesn't impact security, correcting it would improve code quality.\n\n- **Security implications:**  \n  No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code is standard for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (benign constants)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward definitions)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard set of error code constants used for error handling in a cloud SDK or API. It contains no malicious or obfuscated logic, and the scores assigned are appropriate. The only minor note is a typo in one error code name, which does not impact security.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:** No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
