  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely a set of constant string definitions for error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or hidden logic is present.\n   - No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, standard for SDKs or APIs, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscation, and risk:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No reason exists to assign higher scores; the code is benign.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature and standard structure of the code.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of constant definitions for error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are justified and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code's purpose is to provide standardized error codes, which is a common and safe practice in SDKs and APIs.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, and at zero for overall risk.",
