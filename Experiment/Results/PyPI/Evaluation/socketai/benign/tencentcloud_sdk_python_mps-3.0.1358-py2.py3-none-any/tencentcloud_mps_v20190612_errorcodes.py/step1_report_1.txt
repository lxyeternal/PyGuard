{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant error and status codes related to various operations, parameters, and resource states in a system, likely used for error handling and responses.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from predefined constant variables representing error/status codes. There are no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code does not handle or output user input or external data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks because the code only declares constant variables; it does not perform data processing or control flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative with extensive error code definitions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard set of constants for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string constants representing error codes and messages for various failure scenarios, invalid parameters, resource issues, and internal errors. It includes licensing comments and standard coding practices. No code execution, data manipulation, or external interactions are evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The content is straightforward and typical for SDK or API response definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign declaration of error code constants used for handling various operational errors. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. Its purpose is to standardize error responses, and it does so without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
