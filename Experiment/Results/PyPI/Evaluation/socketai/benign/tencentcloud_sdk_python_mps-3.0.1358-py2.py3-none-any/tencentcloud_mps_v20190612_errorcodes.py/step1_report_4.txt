{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of error code constants used for error handling and status reporting in a larger software system, likely related to cloud storage, media processing, or AI services provided by Tencent.",
  "sources": "These constants are static string assignments, not dynamic input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities; the code does not process or output untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code solely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration of error codes with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The comment headers indicate licensing and copyright, standard for open-source code.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only constant string definitions representing various error conditions, mostly related to parameter validation, resource states, and internal errors. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing logic. The constants are organized into categories, but none of them suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of error code definitions used for error handling within a larger system. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for such purposes.",
