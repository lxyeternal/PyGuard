{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of error code constants and messages for a Tencent cloud service, likely related to cloud storage, media processing, or resource management.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module's constant definitions and comments, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects, as it only contains constant definitions and comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only constant error code definitions with descriptive comments. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns are present. The licensing and copyright headers are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of string constants representing error codes and messages, with associated descriptive comments. It includes license information and structured error code definitions for various failure modes, input validation errors, internal errors, resource issues, and authorization problems. There are no functions, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. The presence of error code constants is typical for SDKs or API clients. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors, are evident. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a static definition of error codes and messages for a Tencent cloud SDK or API. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
