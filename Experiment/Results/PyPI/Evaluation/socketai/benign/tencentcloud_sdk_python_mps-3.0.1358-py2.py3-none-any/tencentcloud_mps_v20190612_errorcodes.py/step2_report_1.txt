  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely a set of constant string definitions representing error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n   - No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured, with standard licensing comments and clear naming conventions.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident within the constants themselves.\n   - The only minor note is a typo in one error code: `'FailedOperation.CosStatusInavlid'` (should be `'Invalid'`), but this is a typo in the string value, not a logical flaw.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the content.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly state that this code is a static constants definition with no malicious activity.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content.\n   - Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 and malware score of 0 are justified.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only potential concern is the typo `'FAILEDOPERATION_COSSTATUSINAVLID'`, but this is a string value, not a code logic flaw.\n   - The code is typical for SDKs or API error code definitions, serving as a reference.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static set of error code constants.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n\nThis code is standard, well-structured, and contains no security concerns. The minor typo in one error code string does not impact security or functionality. No further action needed.",
