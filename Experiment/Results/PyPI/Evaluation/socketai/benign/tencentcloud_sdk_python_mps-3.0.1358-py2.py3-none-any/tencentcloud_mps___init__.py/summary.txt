  "security_risk": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic code execution justifies higher scores, which are reasonable. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, but further code review is recommended for confirmation, especially for suspicious patterns."
