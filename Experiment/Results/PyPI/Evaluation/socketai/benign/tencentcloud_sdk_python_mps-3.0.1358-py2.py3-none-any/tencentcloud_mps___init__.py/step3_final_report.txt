  "purpose": "To analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, import statements, data flows, suspicious strings, obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution indicators.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or eval/exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or URLs, obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, suspicious data flows, unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports vary from no code or benign code to suspicious patterns indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution. Most reports correctly assign low malware and obfuscation scores when code appears benign or absent. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, justifying higher scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Slight adjustments are recommended: reducing malware from 0.6 to 0.4 overall, maintaining high obfuscation scores where justified, and reflecting low risk in benign cases. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate given the suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic code execution justifies higher scores, which are reasonable. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, but further code review is recommended for confirmation, especially for suspicious patterns.",
