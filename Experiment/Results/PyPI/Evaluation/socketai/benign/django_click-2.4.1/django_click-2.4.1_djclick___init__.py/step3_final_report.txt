  "purpose": "Support click in Django management commands.",
  "sources": "Imports 'click' via 'from click import *', then deletes 'click'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Import 'click' -> use in module -> delete 'click' from namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from click import *' and 'del click' are unusual but benign stylistic choices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'click' with a wildcard, then deletes the module, likely to avoid namespace pollution. It sets package metadata and imports local adapters. No data processing, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of 'import *' and deletion are stylistic and not indicative of malicious intent. No untrusted input or external data flows are evident. The minimal code and absence of suspicious behavior suggest no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The unusual import and deletion are stylistic choices, not malicious. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate; risk could be lowered to 0 for complete certainty. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
