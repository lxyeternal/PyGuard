  "purpose": "The code initializes a command-line interface for a package, parses arguments, and optionally prints version info or help.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via parser.parse_args() and possibly environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (print). No direct sinks for untrusted data are apparent. Path modification affects import resolution.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) influences control flow (version printing, help display).",
  "anomalies": "Modifies sys.path at runtime to change import behavior; no explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a command parser from a submodule and processes CLI arguments. It conditionally prints version info or help. The modification of sys.path could influence module import behavior but does not directly involve malicious actions. The code structure is typical for CLI wrappers, with no suspicious code injection or backdoors. No external data is retrieved, and no network activity or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward CLI entry point with no malicious intent. The path modification might be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks are evident.",
