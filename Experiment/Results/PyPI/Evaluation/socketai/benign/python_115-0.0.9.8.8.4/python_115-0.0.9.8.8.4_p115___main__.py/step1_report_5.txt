{
  "purpose": "To parse command-line arguments and execute functions or display help/version information based on user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line arguments via 'parser.parse_args()' and the module's own '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs version information or help text via 'print()'. It modifies 'sys.path' to influence module search paths.",
  "flows": "Input args -> parser.parse_args() -> conditional logic -> output via print or function call; sys.path modification influences module import paths.",
  "anomalies": "Modifies 'sys.path' at runtime to change module import behavior, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages command-line interface behavior, importing modules dynamically and adjusting the module search path. The 'path[0]' modification points to the parent directory of the script, potentially to influence module resolution. The rest of the code appears straightforward and standard for CLI scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical command-line interface handler that modifies the import path for module resolution. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The runtime path modification should be reviewed in the context of the overall project but does not indicate malware.",
