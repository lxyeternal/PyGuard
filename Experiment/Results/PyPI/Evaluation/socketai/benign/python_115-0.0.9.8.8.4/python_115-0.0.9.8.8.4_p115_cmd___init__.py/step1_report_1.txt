  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or classes imported from submodules, but none are explicitly used or called here.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from the current snippet as it only imports modules; no data processing or external input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is standard for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module entry point that specifies public symbols and imports several submodules. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It does not execute untrusted data or perform any network or file operations. The code structure is straightforward and clean.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
