{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, defining exported symbols and importing internal submodules for a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports internal modules (.init, .iterdir, .qrcode, .check, .download, .upload).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The current assessments and scores are justified and should be maintained.",
