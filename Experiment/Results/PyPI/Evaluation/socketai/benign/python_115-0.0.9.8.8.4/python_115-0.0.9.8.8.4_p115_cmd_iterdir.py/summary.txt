  "conclusion": "The script exhibits dangerous practices such as unsafe eval/exec and dynamic module installation, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. However, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is present. The security risk is moderate to high (around 0.7), due to unsafe code execution patterns. The code should be used with caution, especially with untrusted input, but it is not inherently malicious."
