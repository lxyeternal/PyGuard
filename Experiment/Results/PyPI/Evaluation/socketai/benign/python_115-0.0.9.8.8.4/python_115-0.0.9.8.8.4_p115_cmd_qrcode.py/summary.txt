  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for automating login and cookie management for the 115 platform. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities based on the provided source. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk score remains minimal. External module trust remains a consideration, but within this code segment, no malicious activity is detected."
