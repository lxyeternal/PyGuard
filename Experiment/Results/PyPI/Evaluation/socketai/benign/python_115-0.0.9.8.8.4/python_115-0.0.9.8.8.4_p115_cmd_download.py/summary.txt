  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for batch downloading files from 115 cloud storage or share links. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the runtime dependency installation, which could be exploited if dependencies are compromised, but this is a supply chain risk rather than malware. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified."
