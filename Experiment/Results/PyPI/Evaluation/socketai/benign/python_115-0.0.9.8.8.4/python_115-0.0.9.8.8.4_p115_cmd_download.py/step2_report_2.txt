  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive CLI utility for batch downloading files from 115 cloud storage or share links.\n- It dynamically imports and installs dependencies at runtime, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behaviors are evident.\n- The network modules (httpx, requests, urllib3, urlopen) are used with fallbacks, and the code handles errors and retries.\n- The main concern could be the dynamic installation of dependencies during runtime, which might be exploited if dependencies are compromised, but this is a common pattern in flexible scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurately describes the script's function.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, seems reasonable due to dynamic dependency installation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as a legitimate download utility with minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes the script's functionality.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified due to runtime dependency installation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states the script's nature and risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Well summarized.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly describes the script.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Appropriately detailed.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 across all reports, justified by the dynamic dependency installation during runtime, which could be exploited if dependencies are compromised, but is standard in flexible scripts.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate given the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to dependency installation approach)\n- **Obfuscation:** 0\n- **Overall:** The script appears legitimate, with the main concern being the runtime dependency installation, which is a common but potentially exploitable pattern if dependencies are compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my analysis. No significant malicious or obfuscated code detected. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering the dependency management approach. The malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure dependencies are from trusted sources, especially when installed during runtime.",
