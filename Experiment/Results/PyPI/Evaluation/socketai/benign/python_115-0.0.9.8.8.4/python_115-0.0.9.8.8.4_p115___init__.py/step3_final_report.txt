  "purpose": "Setup and import configuration for a file upload system, including warning filters and planned features.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'p115client' and local 'component' module; warning filters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; the code only sets up environment and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive TODO comments indicating future feature development; no executable logic or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, warning suppression, and comments outlining future development tasks. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious code is visible. The imported modules are external and could contain malicious code, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious activity is evident. The comments do not suggest malicious intent but indicate ongoing development. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a benign scaffold. High confidence (0.9) is justified given the limited scope and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate. It appears to be a setup script with planned features, but no active logic or malicious payloads are present.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
