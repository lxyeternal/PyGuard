The primary security concern is the runtime dependency installation, which could be exploited if dependencies are compromised, but this is a supply chain risk rather than malware. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified."

The primary concern is the runtime dependency installation, which could be exploited in a compromised environment but is not malicious in itself. The scores are consistent with the code analysis, and the overall security posture is low to moderate."

      "conclusion": "The script exhibits dangerous practices such as unsafe eval/exec and dynamic module installation, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. However, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is present. The security risk is moderate to high (around 0.7), due to unsafe code execution patterns. The code should be used with caution, especially with untrusted input, but it is not inherently malicious."

It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities based on the provided source. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk score remains minimal. External module trust remains a consideration, but within this code segment, no malicious activity is detected."
