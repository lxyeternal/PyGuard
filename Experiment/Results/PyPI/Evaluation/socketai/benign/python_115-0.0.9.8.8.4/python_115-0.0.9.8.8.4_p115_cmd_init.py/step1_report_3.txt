  "purpose": "Define a command-line interface with argument parsing for a toolset called 'python-115'.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse when executed.",
  "sinks": "Uses argparse to process command-line input; no direct sink of untrusted data, but user input could influence program flow.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows through argparse parsing, affecting program behavior based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for CLI applications.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an ArgumentParser with a description and help formatter, adds a version flag, and prepares for subcommands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears to be a standard CLI setup. No external or hidden code, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. The code's security risk is minimal, focused only on input handling, which is common in CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup for a command-line tool using argparse. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for CLI application initialization.",
