  "purpose": "Defines a command-line interface parser with version flag and subcommands for the 'python-115' toolset.",
  "sources": "ArgumentParser and add_argument calls reading command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed beyond argument parsing",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line arguments flow into argparse structures; no further data processing or execution occurs",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward argument parser setup with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for a CLI tool using argparse, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data beyond argument parsing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely argument parsing, which is typical and safe. The minimal security risk scores in some reports are overestimations; given the code's simplicity, the security risk should be set to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a typical argument parser setup with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, with minor overestimations of security risk in some. The appropriate security risk score is 0, malware score 0, obfuscated score 0.",
