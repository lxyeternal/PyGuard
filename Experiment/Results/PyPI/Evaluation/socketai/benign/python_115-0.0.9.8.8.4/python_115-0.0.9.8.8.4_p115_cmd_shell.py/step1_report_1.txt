{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or template for a Python module that is intended to be both executable and importable, but no functional code is present.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit input sources or data reading operations in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are identifiable due to the lack of actual code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation, but no suspicious or unusual code structures, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of shebang and encoding lines, along with TODO comments indicating future work. No executable logic, input handling, or potentially malicious code exists. The comments suggest planned development but do not contain any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal scaffold with no operational code; no malicious behavior or security risks are present. It serves as a starting template rather than an active script.",
