  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder or template with only shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- No actual code, data handling, or logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is just shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Notes:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- **Code presence:** No executable or malicious code present.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk:** All scores are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Reasoning:** The reports are accurate in identifying the code as a non-functional scaffold with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\nGiven the simplicity and lack of any operational code, I agree with the current scores across all reports.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a minimal placeholder with only comments and shebangs, no logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's characteristics. No further adjustments are necessary.",
