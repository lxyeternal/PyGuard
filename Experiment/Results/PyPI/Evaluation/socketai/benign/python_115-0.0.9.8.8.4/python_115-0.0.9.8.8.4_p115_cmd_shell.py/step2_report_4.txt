  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code content.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder or template, with no functional logic, input/output, or data flows.\n- The code is minimal: only shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- Security risks are rated as 0, which seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a placeholder/template with no operational logic, input/output, or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **No significant flaws**. The reports are consistent and accurately describe the code's nature.\n- **Potential overstatement**: Since the code is purely a scaffold, emphasizing \"future development\" is accurate, but some reports mention \"unusual\" comments or \"planned functionality,\" which is fine given the context.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Security risk**: All zero, which is justified.\n- **Malware score**: All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated**: Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence levels**: Appropriately high, given the simplicity.\n\n### Any recommendations for score adjustments?\n\n- No. The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- Since the code is just a scaffold with no logic, any higher scores would be unjustified.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores assigned are appropriate. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and context.",
