  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The provided code snippets are all minimal, consisting solely of shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- No actual code, data handling, or logic exists.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports uniformly identify the code as placeholders or templates, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder/template with no functional code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes absence of executable logic, input/output, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The reasoning aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder/template, can run or import.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no active code or logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The slightly lower confidence is acceptable but still aligns with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder/template with future plans.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no executable code.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risk.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder for a module, can run or import.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder/template with future development.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no operational code.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Judgment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, consistent with the lack of any active or suspicious code.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The assessments are consistent with the code snippets and their descriptions.\n\n**Are any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \nNo. All reports correctly identify the code as a non-functional placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Evaluation**\n\n- The code is purely scaffolding with no executable or malicious code.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe overall security risk is negligible; the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0. The confidence levels are justified given the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code poses no security threat in its current state.",
