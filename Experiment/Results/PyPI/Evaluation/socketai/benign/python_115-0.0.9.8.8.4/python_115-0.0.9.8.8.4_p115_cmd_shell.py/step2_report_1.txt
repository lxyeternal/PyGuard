  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports identify the code as a placeholder or template, consisting solely of shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- No actual logic, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are evident.\n- The code is minimal and intended for future development.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder/template with no functional code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of executable logic, data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *Malware:* 0 — accurate.\n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation.\n- *SecurityRisk:* 0 — no apparent risk.\n- *Confidence:* 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, a placeholder/template.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no active code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *Malware:* 0 — appropriate.\n- *Obfuscated:* 0.\n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.\n- *Confidence:* 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same pattern: placeholder/template with no logic or malicious signs.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *Malware:* 0.\n- *Obfuscated:* 0.\n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.\n- *Confidence:* 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same as above, minimal code, no active logic, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *Malware:* 0.\n- *Obfuscated:* 0.\n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.\n- *Confidence:* 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar assessment: placeholder with no active code or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- *Malware:* 0.\n- *Obfuscated:* 0.\n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.\n- *Confidence:* 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a non-operational scaffold with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious patterns.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as there's no active or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n**Given the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks in the current state.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, placeholder template with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The reports' reasoning and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are thorough and correctly assess the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No adjustments are necessary.",
