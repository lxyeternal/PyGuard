  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or template for a Python module that can run independently or be imported as part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no functional code exists.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comments in Chinese indicating future development; no active code or logic present; no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of shebang, encoding declaration, and TODO comments. There are no actual functions, data handling, or logic to analyze. It appears to be an initial scaffold or template with notes to develop functionality later. Since no executable or data-processing code exists, there's no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-functional placeholder with no suspicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as a template for future development but currently poses no security risks.",
