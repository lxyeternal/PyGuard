  "purpose": "Placeholder/template with no functional code.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution logic exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and intended for future development.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal scaffold with only comments and shebang, indicating a placeholder. No active logic, data handling, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify this as a benign template with no security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-operational scaffold with no malicious activity or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
