  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of shebang, encoding, and TODO comments.\n- No actual logic, data input/output, or executable code is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify these as placeholders or templates for future development.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a scaffold with no functional or malicious code.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the code snippets.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n  The reports do not contain logical errors; they correctly interpret the code as placeholders.  \n  **No errors detected.**\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any active code or suspicious patterns.  \n  The confidence scores are high (0.9-1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code contains no malicious payload, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll assign 0, which is correct. There is no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nAll assign 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate. The code is just a template with no operational logic.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not speculate beyond the evidence; they correctly interpret the code as non-malicious.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies in scoring?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the minimal, placeholder nature of the code, the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, and the correct interpretation by all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0**  \n\nThese reflect that the code is a benign scaffold with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.  \n- **Errors in reports:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Appropriately assigned; no changes needed.  \n- **Overall conclusion:** The code is a safe, non-malicious template with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future code that may build upon this scaffold, especially when actual logic is added. But based on the current state, no security concerns are present.",
