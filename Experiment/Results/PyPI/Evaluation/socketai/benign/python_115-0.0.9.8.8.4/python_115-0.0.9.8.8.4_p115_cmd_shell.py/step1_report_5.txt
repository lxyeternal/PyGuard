  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or template for a Python module that can be run independently or imported.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are observable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comments in Chinese indicating planned functionality; no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of shebang and encoding declarations with TODO comments. There are no function definitions, data processing, or external interactions. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it contain obfuscated code. The comments suggest planning for future implementation but currently lack any operational code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, non-malicious template with no active logic or potential security issues. It serves as a scaffold for future development.",
