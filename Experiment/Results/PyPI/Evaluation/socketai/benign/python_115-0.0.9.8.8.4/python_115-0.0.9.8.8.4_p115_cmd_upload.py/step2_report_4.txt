  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behaviors, code quality, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the script is a legitimate, feature-rich uploader with no malicious behaviors. It highlights dynamic package installation as a potential concern but considers it standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious activity or backdoors are identified. Dynamic imports are common in such scripts, and no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Slight concern due to dynamic package installation, which could be exploited if environment is compromised, but overall low.\n\n- **Assessment:** The score aligns with the analysis. The code is deemed legitimate with no malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's legitimacy. No malicious behavior detected, but notes dynamic dependency installation as a minor anomaly.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No signs of malware, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Same as above, due to runtime dependency installation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the script as a legitimate upload utility but flags the dynamic package installation routines as a potential security concern.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No evidence of malicious code or behavior. The package installation routines are conditional and controlled, not malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3  \n  *Justification:* Slightly higher than previous due to the potential risks of runtime package installation, which could be exploited if manipulated.\n\n- **Assessment:** The score seems reasonable given the context. No malware is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the same dynamic dependency installation routines, noting they could be exploited but are not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious behavior observed. The dynamic import is a fallback mechanism, not an attack vector.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard upload utility with no signs of malicious activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malware indicators.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, aligning with the clear code structure.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2–0.3) due to dynamic package installation routines, which could be exploited if environment or inputs are compromised. However, in normal operation, these routines are controlled and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slight concern over runtime dependency installation routines, but overall low risk given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's analysis. The code appears to be a legitimate, feature-rich upload utility with minimal security concerns. The minor risk stems from the dynamic package installation routines, which are controlled and conditional, not malicious.\n\n**Note:** For enhanced security, consider restricting or auditing the dynamic package installation routines, especially in untrusted environments.",
