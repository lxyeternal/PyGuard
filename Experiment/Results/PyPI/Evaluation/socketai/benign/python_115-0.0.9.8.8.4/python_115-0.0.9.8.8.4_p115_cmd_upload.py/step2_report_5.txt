  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the script as a legitimate, feature-rich uploader for 115 cloud storage, with no signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.  \n  - Dynamic package installation is a potential concern but is common in scripts requiring optional dependencies.  \n  - No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.  \n  - The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  - The scores are reasonable.  \n  - No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's legitimacy and lack of malicious intent. The confidence remains high (0.9), malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected.  \n  - The dynamic dependency installation routines are noted but are not malicious.  \n  - The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent purpose.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  - Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the dynamic package installation routines via subprocess calls, which could be exploited but are used here as fallback mechanisms. The overall conclusion is that the script is legitimate with moderate security concern due to runtime package installation.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The concern about dynamic `pip install` is valid but does not indicate malicious intent.  \n  - No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code.  \n  - The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  - The security risk score of 0.3 is reasonable, given the potential for exploitation if environment variables are manipulated, but not inherently malicious.  \n  - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the dynamic dependency installation routines, which could be exploited but are not malicious in context. The overall assessment is that the script is a legitimate utility.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.  \n  - The dynamic installation routines are noted but not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n  - The security risk score of 0.2 is consistent with the potential risk of dependency manipulation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard upload utility with no signs of malicious activity. The analysis confirms no suspicious network or code behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or secret exfiltration.  \n  - The dynamic library installation routines are cautious and standard.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  - Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as no malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.2 to 0.3), reflecting potential concerns about dynamic dependency installation routines but not actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \n**Risk:** **0.2** (a cautious but justified low risk due to dynamic package installs, which could be exploited if environment is compromised)\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent across reports and justified given the code analysis. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured batch upload utility for 115 cloud storage, with no malicious behaviors or supply chain risks evident from the provided source. The cautious risk score accounts for the dynamic dependency installation routines but does not indicate actual malicious activity.",
