  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, feature-rich batch uploader for 115 cloud storage with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The primary concern is the runtime dependency installation, which could be exploited in a compromised environment but is not malicious in itself. The scores are consistent with the code analysis, and the overall security posture is low to moderate."
