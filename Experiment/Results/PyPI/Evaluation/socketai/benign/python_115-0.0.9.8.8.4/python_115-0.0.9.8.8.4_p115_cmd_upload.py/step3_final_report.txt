  "purpose": "A command-line utility for batch uploading files and directories to 115 cloud storage, supporting features like resumable uploads, progress reporting, and dynamic dependency management.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (scandir, stat, open), user input via command-line arguments, network requests via dynamically imported modules, environment variables for cookies and paths.",
  "sinks": "Network modules (requests, urllib3, urlopen), subprocess calls for package installation, filesystem modifications (remove, removedirs), and local file deletions.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads trigger hashing and upload processes; network modules handle requests; subprocess calls may install dependencies; error handling and retries manage flow control; dynamic imports influence module behavior based on user options.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import and runtime installation of dependencies via subprocess pip calls, which could be exploited if environment variables or inputs are manipulated; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive file upload utility with extensive path handling, progress reporting, and network support. It performs filesystem operations, hashing, and network requests in a standard manner. The dynamic dependency installation routines are notable but serve as fallback mechanisms, not malicious features. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The dynamic import routines could pose a supply chain risk if environment is compromised, but in normal operation, they are controlled and conditional. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to dependency management routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, feature-rich batch uploader for 115 cloud storage with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The primary concern is the runtime dependency installation, which could be exploited in a compromised environment but is not malicious in itself. The scores are consistent with the code analysis, and the overall security posture is low to moderate.",
