  "purpose": "Define constant values for the linode_metadata package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only a string assignment to LOGGER_NAME.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple constant assignment with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single string assignment to LOGGER_NAME, which is a constant. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code elements. The simplicity and clarity suggest normal configuration code with no malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constant definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data handling or actions that could be exploited.",
