  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal, static, and typical for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no suspicious or malicious elements.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration, which is inherently low risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports agree there is no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score remains 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.",
