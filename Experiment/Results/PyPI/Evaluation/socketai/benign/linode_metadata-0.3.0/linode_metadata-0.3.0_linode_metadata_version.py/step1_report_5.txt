  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only setting a version string with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a string assignment for the __version__ variable. It lacks any logic, data handling, external calls, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior. It appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation detected in this code. It is a simple, benign version string assignment.",
