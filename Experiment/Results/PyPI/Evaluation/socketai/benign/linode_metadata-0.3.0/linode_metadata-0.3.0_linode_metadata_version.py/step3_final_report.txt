  "purpose": "Define the version of the package with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; the code is static and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python modules. It contains no input handling, external calls, dynamic code, or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with high confidence scores and no malicious or security concerns. The code's simplicity and static nature mean there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
