  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The code is benign and typical for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly describe the code as a straightforward version declaration.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- They do not overlook any hidden malicious behavior, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is appropriate.  \n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `confidence` scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign, there is no justification for higher risk scores.  \n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is accurate.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static assignment of a version string with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or suspicious constructs. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No issues or malicious intent are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- Confirm that the code remains a simple version declaration in the repository.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nWhile the current code is harmless, always remain vigilant for future dynamic or complex code snippets that could introduce risks.",
