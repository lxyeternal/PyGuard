  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is minimal and typical for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that this is a benign, static version declaration with no suspicious elements. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1.0 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports confidently identify the code as benign, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified. The current score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or behavior detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on static, straightforward code analysis without assumptions of hidden behaviors. The assessments are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicating benign, non-obfuscated, non-malicious code with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Code Analysis**: The code is a simple, static version string assignment, typical in Python modules.\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. No additional risks or malicious concerns are present.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
