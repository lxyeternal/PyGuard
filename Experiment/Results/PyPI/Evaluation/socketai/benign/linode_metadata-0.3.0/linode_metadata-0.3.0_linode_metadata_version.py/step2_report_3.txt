  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and typical for version declaration in Python modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No reports identify any obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execute any commands.\n   - The version string `v0.3.0` is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscation is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence is 1.0, reflecting high certainty based on the static, simple code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:\n   - No issues are present in the code; all assessments seem accurate.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior is detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and no adjustments are necessary.",
