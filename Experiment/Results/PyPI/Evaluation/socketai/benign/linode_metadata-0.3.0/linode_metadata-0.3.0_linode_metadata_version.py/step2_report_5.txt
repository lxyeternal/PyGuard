  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or dynamic elements. The code is minimal and standard for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0  \nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree there are no malicious behaviors, no data flows, and no anomalies, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature. There is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo claims are made beyond the factual analysis that this is a simple version declaration. All assessments are reasonable and based on the code content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and the analyses provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the existing assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
