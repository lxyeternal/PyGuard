{
  "purpose": "Define data structure for SSH keys response associated with users in a Linode instance",
  "sources": "None; the code imports modules and defines a data class without reading external input",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or output, no untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow is present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dataclass SSHKeysResponse that inherits from ResponseBase, and declares a users attribute as a dictionary mapping strings to lists of strings. There are no input sources, external data handling, or malicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward data structure definition for representing SSH key data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data class definition with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
