{
  "purpose": "Define a data class representing SSH keys associated with users for a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "Imports dataclasses, typing for data structure definitions, and a local response_base module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no functions or data processing beyond data class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and typical for data structure definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass SSHKeysResponse inheriting from ResponseBase, with a single attribute 'users' which maps user identifiers to lists of SSH keys. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns detected. The imports and class structure are standard for a data model in Python. The code lacks any dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. The overall structure indicates a simple data container.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic data class definition for SSH key management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
