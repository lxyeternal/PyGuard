{
  "purpose": "Define data classes related to SSH Keys associated with a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute 'users'",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "Data from 'users' attribute to potential consumers within the application, no external flow evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected; code is straightforward data modeling",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a data class SSHKeysResponse that inherits from ResponseBase. The class contains a 'users' dictionary mapping user identifiers to lists of SSH keys. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a simple data container without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class definition for SSH key management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
