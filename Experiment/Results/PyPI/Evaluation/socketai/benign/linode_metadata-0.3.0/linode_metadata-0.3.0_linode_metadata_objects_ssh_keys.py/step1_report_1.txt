  "purpose": "Define a data class for SSH Keys response related to users in a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute declaration",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, output, or external interactions",
  "flows": "N/A; code defines a data structure without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a data class inheriting from ResponseBase, and specifies a 'users' attribute as a dictionary mapping user identifiers to lists of SSH keys. There are no input sources like environment variables, network operations, or user input handling. The class is a simple data container with no executable logic, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data class definition used for organizing SSH key information. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation suitable for its purpose.",
