  "purpose": "Data class representing SSH keys associated with users in a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the class defines a data structure with the 'users' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a static data container without methods or dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class 'SSHKeysResponse' inheriting from 'ResponseBase', containing a 'users' dictionary mapping strings to lists of strings. It imports only standard modules and a local base class, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. The class is purely a data container with no executable logic or malicious elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data class for representing SSH keys associated with users. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
