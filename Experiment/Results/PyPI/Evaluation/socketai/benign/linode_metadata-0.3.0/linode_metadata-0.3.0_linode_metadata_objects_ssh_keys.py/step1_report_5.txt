  "purpose": "Define a data class representing SSH keys associated with users in a response context.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code defining data structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely a data structure definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of dataclasses and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataclass and type hints, then defines an SSHKeysResponse class extending ResponseBase, containing a dictionary mapping user identifiers to lists of SSH keys. There are no input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows. The class appears to serve as a data container for SSH key information. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign data structure definition for handling SSH key data within a larger application. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
