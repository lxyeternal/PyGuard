  "purpose": "Define objects for API responses by importing modules related to instance, networking, ssh_keys, and token.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local package components: .instance, .networking, .ssh_keys, .token.",
  "sinks": "No direct data processing or handling; no untrusted data sources identified within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports modules and contains no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports components for API response objects. It does not execute any logic, process inputs, or interact with external data sources. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The import statements suggest modular organization but do not in themselves pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement block for organizing API response objects. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
