  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported concerns, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nObjects for API responses.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom .instance import *\nfrom .networking import *\nfrom .ssh_keys import *\nfrom .token import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n\n- The code only performs import statements from local modules.\n- No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The comments are benign.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`*`) is stylistically discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The security of the overall package depends on the imported modules, which are not shown here.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Importing modules for API response objects; benign; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report is accurate. The code is benign, and no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; benign; straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, accurate. No issues found. The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import statements; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No anomalies or malicious signs. Confidence score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import modules; notes use of wildcard imports which can obscure imported names; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The concern about wildcard imports is valid, as they can hide imported names and potentially introduce namespace pollution.\n- However, wildcard imports alone do not imply malicious intent.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 reflects a minor style concern rather than a security threat.\n- Confidence of 0.9 is reasonable, given the benign nature but acknowledgment of style issues.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe securityRisk score could remain at 0.1; it’s a style issue, not a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Wildcard imports again; potential for hiding malicious code, but no actual evidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The concern about wildcard imports is valid, but again, no actual malicious activity is observed.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting a moderate concern about namespace pollution.\n- Confidence of 0.8 is appropriate, given the minimal code and lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Slightly higher for reports highlighting wildcard imports, which is justified as a style and maintainability concern but not a security risk.\n- **Confidence:** High for all, given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- The minor security risks associated with wildcard imports are acknowledged but do not constitute security threats.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as zero.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to wildcard imports' style concern)  \n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no malicious activity. Wildcard imports are a style concern but not security issues. Therefore, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 (to reflect the wildcard import concern)  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The minor concern about wildcard imports is noted but does not elevate the security risk significantly. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet provided.",
