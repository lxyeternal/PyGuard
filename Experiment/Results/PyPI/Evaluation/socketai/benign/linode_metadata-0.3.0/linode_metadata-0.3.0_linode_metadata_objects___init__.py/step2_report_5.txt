  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nObjects for API responses.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom .instance import *\nfrom .networking import *\nfrom .ssh_keys import *\nfrom .token import *\n```\n\nThis code only contains import statements from local modules, with no additional logic, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code itself does not contain malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** Not detectable here; the code is purely import statements.\n- **Use of wildcard imports (`*`):** This can be a style concern because it obscures what exactly is imported, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- **Potential security risks:** Minimal; the main concern is maintainability and clarity, not security.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Import-based, benign, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected. Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same benign import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Notes use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported objects.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The concern about wildcard imports is valid from a style and maintainability perspective but does not imply malicious activity. The assigned security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, reflecting a minor concern rather than a real threat. Confidence is high, which is appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Also notes wildcard imports, potential obscurity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 4, the concern about wildcard imports is valid but does not indicate malicious activity. The security risk score (0.2) is slightly higher, possibly overestimating the risk, but still within a reasonable range considering the style concern. Confidence is slightly lower, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** The scores for security risk are low, reflecting minor concerns about wildcard imports. They are reasonable given the context.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1) in the benign nature of the code, except for Reports 4 and 5, which appropriately reflect slightly lower confidence due to style concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The use of wildcard imports (`*`) is generally discouraged because it reduces code clarity and maintainability. While not malicious, it could hide imported objects, which might be exploited if the imported modules contain malicious code.\n- The security risk scores for Reports 4 and 5 are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1, aligning with the minor style concern rather than a security threat.\n- Overall, the scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1, reflecting style concerns rather than security issues.\n- **Confidence:** Should be 1 for all, as the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which affects code clarity but not security directly. The current scoring appropriately reflects this.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge the style concern)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and ensures consistent, justified scoring.",
