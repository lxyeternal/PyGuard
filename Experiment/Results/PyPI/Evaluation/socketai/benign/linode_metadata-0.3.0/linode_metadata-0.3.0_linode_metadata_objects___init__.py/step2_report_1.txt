  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- The code imports modules related to API response objects from local modules.\n- Several reports mention the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No reports identify actual malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- The code does not process data, execute dynamic code, or interact with external sources.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n**Code verification:**\n- The code is a set of import statements, with no execution or data handling.\n- The only potential concern is the use of wildcard imports (`from .module import *`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There are no malicious issues or security vulnerabilities directly present in this code snippet.\n- The only noteworthy point is the use of wildcard imports, which can be considered a style or maintenance concern but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and primarily imports modules.\n- Some reports mention the risk of namespace pollution due to wildcard imports, which is valid.\n- No report claims the presence of malicious code or exploits.\n\n**Note:** Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they can lead to unclear namespace pollution, but they do not automatically indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- All reports assign very low or zero risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n**However:**\n- For reports that mention wildcard imports, a slight increase in security risk score (e.g., 0.2) is justified due to potential namespace pollution concerns, even if not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):\n\n- None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5, and given the benign nature, such high scores are unwarranted.\n- The highest risk score in the reports is 0.2, which seems appropriate considering the wildcard import concern.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores with the reports:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the content and analysis.\n- No report overstates the risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern over wildcard imports, but not significant)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with only minor stylistic concerns. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The scores should remain low, reflecting the minimal risk.",
