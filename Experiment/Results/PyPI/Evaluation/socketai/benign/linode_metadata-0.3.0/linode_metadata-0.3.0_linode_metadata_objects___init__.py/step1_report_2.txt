{
  "purpose": "The code defines objects for API responses by importing modules related to instance, networking, ssh_keys, and token.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .instance, .networking, .ssh_keys, and .token.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established within this snippet as it solely imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The imports are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports modules from the same package directory, serving as a module aggregator or initializer for API response objects. There is no data processing, input handling, or dynamic execution present. Since the code is minimal and purely import statements, it presents no security issues or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple module imports to organize API response objects. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
