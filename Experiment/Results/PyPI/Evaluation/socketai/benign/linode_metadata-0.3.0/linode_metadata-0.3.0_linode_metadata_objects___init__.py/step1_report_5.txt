  "purpose": "Import modules related to API response objects for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing all contents from local modules: instance, networking, ssh_keys, token.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows observable within this code snippet; it only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure the actual contents imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, specifically wildcard imports from several local modules. This approach can be risky as it makes it difficult to determine what exactly is imported and may hide malicious or unintended code within those modules. The snippet does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or network operations. Given the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues directly in this file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import module primarily used to bring in various components for API responses. The use of wildcard imports is not ideal but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this specific snippet.",
