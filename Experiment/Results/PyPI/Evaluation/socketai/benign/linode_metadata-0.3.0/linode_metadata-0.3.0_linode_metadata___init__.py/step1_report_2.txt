  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from a known third-party package 'linode_metadata'. There are no data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, and no network or file operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are apparent based on this minimal snippet. The imports are standard and relate to metadata access within a Linode environment, which is a legitimate use case. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only importing modules for metadata handling. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
