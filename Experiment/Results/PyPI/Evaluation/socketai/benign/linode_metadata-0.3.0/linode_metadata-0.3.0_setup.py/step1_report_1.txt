  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code imports a library and calls a function without reading external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the setup() function is a standard method that does not process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only initializes package setup with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior; the code is minimal and standard for packaging scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with default parameters, indicating a typical package initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not include hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. Given its simplicity and adherence to standard practice, it appears to be a benign packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
