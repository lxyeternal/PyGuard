{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with no arguments, typically used as a placeholder or default configuration.",
  "sources": "No external input, data sources, or dynamic data; static import and function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of arguments in setup() is unusual but not suspicious; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard minimal setup script with no malicious or security concerns. It does not read untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
