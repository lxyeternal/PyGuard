{
  "purpose": "To configure and prepare the package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; standard setup() invocation with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions beyond calling setup().",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; setup() is called with default parameters and no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward invocation of setuptools' setup() function with no parameters. It serves as a minimal setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The simplicity and standard usage reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
