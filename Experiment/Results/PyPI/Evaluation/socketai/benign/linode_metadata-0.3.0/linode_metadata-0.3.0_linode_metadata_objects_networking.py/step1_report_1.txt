  "purpose": "Define data structures for networking information related to a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations, data class fields, imports",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Data flows from class fields to instances representing network configurations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Use of optional fields and metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with type annotations, intended to model networking data. It imports standard modules and a base response class. No input/output handling, network operations, or code execution logic present. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code observed. The use of 'metadata' in fields is typical for serialization/deserialization purposes. Overall, the code appears straightforward and aligned with normal data modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data classes for networking information. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
