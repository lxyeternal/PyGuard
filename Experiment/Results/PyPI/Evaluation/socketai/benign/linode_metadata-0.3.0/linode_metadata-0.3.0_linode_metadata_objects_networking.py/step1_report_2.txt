  "purpose": "Define data classes for representing network-related information associated with a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any output that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python dataclasses to model network information, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. It references other modules and employs optional typing. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless set of data classes for network configuration information, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
