  "purpose": "Define data classes related to networking information for a Linode instance.",
  "sources": "Reading class definitions, imported modules, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling; data classes are used for data representation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., network responses) into these classes when instantiated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with type annotations and metadata for JSON serialization. No dynamic execution, no input parsing, and no interaction with external data sources are present. Import of ResponseBase suggests inheritance from a base class, but no suspicious behavior is evident. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observable. The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for network info. No obfuscation, malware, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard data class definitions for network data representation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
