  "purpose": "Data classes modeling network configuration information for Linode instances, including interfaces, IPv4, and IPv6 details.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes such as 'label', 'purpose', 'ipam_address', and lists of IP addresses; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects, as the code only defines data structures without processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "The data flows from class instantiation to attribute access; no data processing or untrusted data flow occurs within this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions for network-related information, with no dynamic behavior, network calls, or code execution. It uses standard Python features and metadata for serialization. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of optional fields and metadata is typical for such data schemas. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data schema for network configuration data, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
