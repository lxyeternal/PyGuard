  "purpose": "Define data classes for representing Linode instance information and backups status.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily imports modules and defines data classes with fixed attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output is performed.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines structured data containers without any data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard use of dataclasses and type annotations without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataclass and type annotations, then defines three dataclasses: InstanceBackups, InstanceSpecs, and InstanceResponse. These classes encapsulate information about Linode instances and their backups, with clear, fixed attribute types. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward data schema definition for API responses or internal data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign data structure definition without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a schema for Linode instance data and does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
