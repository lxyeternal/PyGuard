  "purpose": "Define data classes representing Linode instance information and backups.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscation, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Python data class definitions that model the response structure for Linode instances and backups. It imports standard and local modules without performing any data manipulation, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. It uses type annotations and inheritance properly. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of data classes for Linode instances. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
