{
  "purpose": "Define data classes related to Linode instances, including backup status, specifications, and overall instance response.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and a local module response_base; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input, output, or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no processing of external input present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data modeling with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three data classes with no functions or dynamic execution. It imports standard libraries and a local module. The classes specify data fields with types and optionality, typical for response modeling. No external inputs, no data processing, and no external communications are present. The structure is standard for such models, with no signs of malicious or malicious-looking code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data model setup for Linode instance responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is benign and appears to serve purely for data representation.",
