{
  "purpose": "Define data classes related to Linode instances for use in API responses or internal processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute declarations",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external communication present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with type annotations, inheriting from a base response class. It uses standard Python features with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. There are no sources of untrusted data, nor are there sinks or flows that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a typical model definition for API responses, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for Linode instances without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
