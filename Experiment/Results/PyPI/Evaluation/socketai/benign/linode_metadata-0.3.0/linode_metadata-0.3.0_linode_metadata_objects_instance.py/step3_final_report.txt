  "purpose": "Data classes modeling Linode instance responses, backups, and specifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and local response_base; class attributes defining instance data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data model with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard use of dataclasses and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Linode instances, backups, and specs, inheriting from a base response class. It uses standard Python features without dynamic code, external data processing, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural, serving as data schemas for API responses. No signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
