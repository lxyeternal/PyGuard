  "purpose": "Define data classes related to Linode instances and their backups, specifications, and responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing, and local module response_base; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output within the code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of data class instances with provided attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data class definitions that model Linode instance data. It uses standard Python features (dataclasses, type hints) and imports from a local module. No data is read from external sources, no external network calls, no suspicious logic or obfuscation present. The classes serve as data containers without executing any code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for Linode instances with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is well-structured, simple, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
