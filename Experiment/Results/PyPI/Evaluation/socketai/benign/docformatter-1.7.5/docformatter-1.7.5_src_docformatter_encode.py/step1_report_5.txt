  "purpose": "This module provides an Encoder class for handling file encoding detection and newline identification in text files.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files specified by filename parameter in do_detect_encoding and do_open_with_encoding methods; reads lines from source list in do_find_newline.",
  "sinks": "Opens files with specified encoding in do_open_with_encoding; reads file contents in do_detect_encoding.",
  "flows": "do_detect_encoding reads from file and updates self.encoding based on file content; do_find_newline analyzes source list for newline detection; do_open_with_encoding opens file with self.encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious file handling; standard encoding detection; no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors; use of charset_normalizer appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs encoding detection and newline style analysis for text files. It uses a third-party library charset_normalizer for encoding detection, which is legitimate. File operations are standard, and there are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The methods follow normal patterns for encoding detection and file handling without any suspicious or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for encoding and newline detection in text files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet.",
