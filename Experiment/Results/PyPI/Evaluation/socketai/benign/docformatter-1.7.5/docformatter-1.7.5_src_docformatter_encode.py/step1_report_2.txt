{
  "purpose": "Provides encoding detection and handling for file reading and writing, primarily for use in a code formatter tool.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths via function parameters; reads files in do_detect_encoding and do_open_with_encoding methods.",
  "sinks": "Opens files with specified encoding; reads entire file contents in do_detect_encoding.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> do_detect_encoding -> from_path and do_open_with_encoding -> file read; filename input -> do_open_with_encoding -> file open.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard use of third-party library for encoding detection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an Encoder class that detects file encoding using charset_normalizer and opens files with specified encoding. It handles exceptions gracefully and defaults to 'latin-1' on errors. The do_find_newline method analyzes line endings to determine the predominant newline character. There is no code that performs network activity, data exfiltration, or any malicious operations. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for encoding detection and file handling, typical in formatting tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for encoding detection and file handling. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The third-party library usage is appropriate for its purpose. Overall security risk is very low.",
