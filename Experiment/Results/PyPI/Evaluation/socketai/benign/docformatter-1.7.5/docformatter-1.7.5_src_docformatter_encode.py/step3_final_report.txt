  "purpose": "Provides encoding detection and newline analysis utilities for text files, using charset_normalizer for encoding detection and counting line ending styles.",
  "sources": "Reads files via do_open_with_encoding method; analyzes lines in do_find_newline method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication; file reading is standard.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> do_detect_encoding reads file -> sets encoding; source lines -> do_find_newline counts line endings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for encoding detection and newline style analysis. It uses standard library functions and a legitimate third-party library. Exception handling defaults to 'latin-1' fallback, which is typical. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
