{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the __all__ variable and import various modules and classes related to a documentation formatter package.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from __pkginfo__, strings, syntax, util, configuration, encode, format modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no use of untrusted data, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and sets module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The import statements include wildcard imports which can be risky but are common in package internal code.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only license information, documentation, and import statements. No runtime data handling, user input, or external communications are present. The wildcard imports could potentially introduce unwanted names, but this is typical in internal package modules and not malicious. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent. It primarily handles imports and module exports. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
