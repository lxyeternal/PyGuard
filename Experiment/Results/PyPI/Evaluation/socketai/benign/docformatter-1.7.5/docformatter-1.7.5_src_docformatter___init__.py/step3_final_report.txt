{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initializer for 'docformatter', setting up module exports and importing internal components.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports and license comments; no external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only performs static imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing internal modules and defining '__all__', with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Wildcard imports ('from .strings import *', etc.) are used, which can be risky but are common in internal package modules; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with license info, documentation, and import statements. No runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Wildcard imports are used but are typical in internal modules. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are observed. The code's purpose is to expose module components, and it does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard imports, while generally discouraged, is acceptable in this context and does not indicate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
