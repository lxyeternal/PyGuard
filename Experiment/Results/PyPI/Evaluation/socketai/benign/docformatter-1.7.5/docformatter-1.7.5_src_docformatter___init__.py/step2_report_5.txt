  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward package initialization script.\n   - No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, or external data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are identified.\n   - Wildcard imports are used, which can be risky in terms of namespace pollution but are common in internal package modules and not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code primarily sets the `__all__` variable and imports internal modules, including version info and various components needed for the package.\n   - No runtime data handling, user input, or external communication.\n   - License and documentation comments are present, indicating good open-source practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero, reflecting no evident security risk.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they can introduce unintended symbols into the namespace, but this is a common pattern in package `__init__.py` files and does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable given the code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard package initializer.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores given are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, serving only to set up package metadata and imports. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The use of wildcard imports, while generally discouraged, is typical in internal package modules and does not constitute a security concern here.  \n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present that would warrant a higher risk score.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
