  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The code only contains license information, import statements, and module exports.\n   - No network activity, data processing, or external communications are present.\n   - Wildcard imports ('from .module import *') are used, which can be risky but are common in internal package code and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is clear and readable; no obfuscated code patterns are present.\n   - The import statements are explicit, aside from the wildcard imports, which are standard in some package contexts.\n\n3. **Security Risks:**\n   - No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n   - The code is purely for setting up package metadata and internal module imports.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. There is no indication of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports give a very low or zero risk score, which is consistent with the findings.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can lead to namespace pollution or unintended symbol exposure. However, this is a common pattern in package internal modules and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the code and the reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: very low) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for wildcard imports, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior.\n- Wildcard imports are typical in internal package code, not malicious.\n- No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe package appears safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk stems from the wildcard imports, which are not inherently malicious but could be improved for clarity and safety.",
