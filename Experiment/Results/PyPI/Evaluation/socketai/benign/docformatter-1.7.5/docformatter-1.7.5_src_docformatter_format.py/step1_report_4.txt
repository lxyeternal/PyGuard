{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for formatting Python docstrings and code, including removing blank lines and adjusting docstring styles.",
  "sources": "Reads source code, tokens, and docstring contents; reads files and standard input.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted source code to standard output or files, outputs diffs, handles file operations.",
  "flows": "Reads source input, tokenizes, processes tokens (including docstrings), then writes back formatted code or diffs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and clean token processing. No network activity, reverse shells, or data leaks observed. The code mainly handles formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured formatter for Python code, focusing on handling tokens, especially string tokens (docstrings). It uses standard library modules like 'tokenize' for tokenization and 'difflib' for diffs. The code performs file reading/writing, token manipulation, and string processing for docstrings. No signs of code injection, network communication, or malicious behavior. The absence of any hidden or obfuscated code, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms suggests a benign purpose. It strictly adheres to formatting tasks without manipulating or leaking sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate code formatter with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured for its purpose, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
