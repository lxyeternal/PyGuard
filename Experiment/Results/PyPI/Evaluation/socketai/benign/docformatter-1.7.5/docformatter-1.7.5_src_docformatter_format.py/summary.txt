  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured Python code formatter with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. It operates solely on source code tokens for formatting purposes, with no network activity or hidden payloads. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to file handling and token processing, which are standard in such tools."
