  "purpose": "This module provides a class for formatting Python docstrings and code, including removing blank lines, wrapping text, and managing string quotes.",
  "sources": "Token generation from source code via 'tokenize.generate_tokens', reading source code from files or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Writing formatted code back to files, stdout, or diff output; reading files; potentially unsafe if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Source tokens are generated from source code; tokens are processed and potentially modified; formatted code is written back to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code primarily handles text processing and file I/O. No obfuscated code patterns, no dynamic execution, or unusual variables are present. External imports are standard or ignored via type: ignore.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard tokenization, string handling, and file I/O for code formatting purposes. It removes blank lines between definitions and docstrings, wraps docstring summaries and descriptions, and manages string quotes. No code injection, malicious data leaks, or suspicious network activity are evident. The functions are straightforward, with proper handling of token streams and file operations. No signs of hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors are detected. The import statements are either standard library or known third-party packages for formatting tasks. There is no evidence of code that exfiltrates data, connects to suspicious domains, or executes any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a benign code formatter utility focused on style and formatting enhancements. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It is a legitimate open-source style formatting tool with no evident security risks.",
