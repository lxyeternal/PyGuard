{
  "purpose": "This module provides a class for formatting Python docstrings and related code adjustments, mainly for code style consistency.",
  "sources": "Input is read from files or standard input; data is processed via tokenization and string manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Formatted code is written back to files or output streams; no untrusted data is sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data is tokenized; docstrings are identified and reformatted; tokens are untokenized and output; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs standard formatting and token processing.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs code style formatting for Python files and standard input, including tokenization, manipulation of string tokens (docstrings), and output. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. It handles file I/O securely with context managers and uses standard libraries. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are observed. The functions for formatting, token handling, and diff generation are typical for a code formatter, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Python code formatter focused on styling docstrings and code structure. It performs standard operations with no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. The overall risk score is very low.",
