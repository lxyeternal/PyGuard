  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's a CLI for a docstring formatter, taking input from arguments, stdin, or files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks; data flows are typical for CLI tools.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code imports standard modules and specific formatting modules, handles signals, and provides a typical CLI interface. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Completely benign, straightforward CLI utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is a CLI for formatting docstrings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external network or data exfiltration, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, possibly considering minimal risk due to general CLI operations). This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes a standard CLI for formatting documentation strings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious signs, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings: a CLI tool with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: a legitimate formatting CLI.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard CLI utility for formatting docstrings, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to general CLI operations, which is reasonable but could be lowered to 0 given the absence of any risky behavior.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 would be appropriate for all reports, unless specific context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured CLI tool for formatting Python docstrings. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The current scores are appropriate, though the risk scores could be reduced to 0 for full confidence.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and purely intended for formatting purposes.",
