  "purpose": "The script is designed to provide a command-line interface for formatting Python docstrings according to specific styles and options, using the 'docformatter' package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (argv), standard input (stdin), and potentially file contents specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to standard output (stdout) or files for formatted content; calls functions that perform formatting operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from command-line args or files flow into formatting functions; formatted output is sent to stdout or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of signal handling and standard library imports are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI tool setup with argument parsing, help message display, and invoking formatting routines from the 'docformatter' package. It handles signals and user input in a typical manner. There are no signs of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated routines. The code’s structure and imports are straightforward, focusing on formatting functionality without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for formatting docstrings, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for such tools and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
