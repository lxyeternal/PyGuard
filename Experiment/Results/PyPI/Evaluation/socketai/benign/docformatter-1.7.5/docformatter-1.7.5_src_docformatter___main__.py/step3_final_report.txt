  "purpose": "A command-line utility for formatting Python docstrings according to specified styles and options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, standard input (stdin), and files specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Formatting functions that process input data; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from args or stdin flows into formatting routines; output is written to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the 'docformatter' library, handling argument parsing, signal management, and invoking formatting routines. It imports only standard libraries and the formatting modules, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Signal handling for SIGPIPE is standard, and the code structure is clear and conventional. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard CLI utility for formatting Python docstrings. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0. The risk score, initially slightly above zero in some reports, should be set to 0, reflecting the absence of any security concerns.",
