{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for locating Python source files and checking line length/range constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'sources' parameter, which is an iterable of file or directory paths, and possibly from environment variables via sysconfig.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write data to external systems, but it generates file paths for further processing. No sinks indicate data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Sources (file paths) are passed to find_py_files, which yields file paths. No data flows into or out of sensitive sinks such as network or database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Functions are straightforward. Usage of sysconfig and os libraries appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file discovery and validation of line lengths within source files, with no dynamic code execution or external communication. It excludes hidden files and specified directories. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for file handling and validation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
