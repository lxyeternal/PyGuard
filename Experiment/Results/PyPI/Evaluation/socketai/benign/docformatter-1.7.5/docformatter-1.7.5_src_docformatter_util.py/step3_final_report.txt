  "purpose": "Utility functions for discovering Python source files and validating line lengths and ranges within source files.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths provided in 'sources' parameter, read during os.path.isdir, os.walk, and filename checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input beyond filesystem reading, which is benign.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths -> Directory traversal -> File filtering based on extension and hidden/exclusion rules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward filesystem and string operations with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign file discovery and validation functions using standard libraries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The security risk scores in the reports are slightly above zero (0.1), but given the benign nature, they should be set to 0.0 for accuracy. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly at 0.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, with minor overestimation of security risk. The scores should be finalized as malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0.",
