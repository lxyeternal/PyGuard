{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for finding Python files in directories, checking string lengths, and range validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input directories and filenames; uses 'sources' parameter for input paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Source of directory and filename inputs; no data flows to untrusted outputs or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'unicode' alias for 'str' (not malicious), no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to find Python source files within directories, respecting exclusions and recursion. It also checks line lengths and ranges for source code analysis purposes. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions operate solely on filesystem inputs and perform local checks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for file discovery and range checking, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. It is consistent with standard code for static analysis tools or code formatting utilities.",
