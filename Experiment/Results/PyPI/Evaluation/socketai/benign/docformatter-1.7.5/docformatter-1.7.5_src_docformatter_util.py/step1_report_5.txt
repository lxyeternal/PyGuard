{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for locating Python source files and analyzing line lengths/ranges for documentation or code formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment paths via sysconfig.get_paths(), and accepts external sources input for file discovery.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data, and there are no network operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources are the provided file paths and environment data, flowing into file discovery functions without any unsafe or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard modules and functions; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: 'find_py_files' for discovering Python files with optional recursion and exclusions, and 'has_correct_length' and 'is_in_range' for analyzing line lengths and ranges. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is processed in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The environment data from sysconfig is standard and does not pose a security risk. The code structure and functions are straightforward and follow common patterns for file handling and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for file discovery and analysis tasks. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and does not perform any network or data exfiltration activities. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
