  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for file discovery and line range/length validation.\n- It uses standard libraries: os, re, sysconfig.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears benign and typical for static analysis or formatting tools.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, safe, legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes benign utility functions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign utility functions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no signs of malicious activity, standard filtering.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature of the code, this seems overstated. The code does not interact with untrusted sources or perform any risky operations.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0.0 for consistency. The code is purely filesystem-based with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 4, the securityRisk score is slightly elevated without justification.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-report conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware; set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; set to 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports, but the code is straightforward and safe. The risk score should be 0.0, not 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1.0, appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n\nThe code is a standard utility module with no security issues. The minor elevation in the reported security risk scores appears unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of recommended score adjustments:\n\n- For all reports, **securityRisk** should be **0.0**.\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at **0.0**.\n- Maintain high confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent with the code, and no malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The slight overestimation of security risk should be corrected for accuracy.",
