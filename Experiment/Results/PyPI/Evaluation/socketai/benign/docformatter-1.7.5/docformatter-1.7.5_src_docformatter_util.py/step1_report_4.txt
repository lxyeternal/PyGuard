{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for finding Python files in directories, checking line lengths, and range inclusion, primarily used in code formatting or analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Reads input sources from the 'sources' parameter; reads directory contents via os.walk; accesses sysconfig.get_paths() for system paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.path.join to generate file paths; performs regex searches for exclusions; no untrusted data is processed in a manner leading to code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources (file paths, directory names) are iterated over and filtered; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations like executing code or network access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected; functions perform standard file system and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for file discovery and range checks, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and performs typical filtering based on filenames and directory names. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted, and there are no suspicious patterns such as network activity, code injection, or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility for file detection and range validation, with no malicious intent or security risks evident based on the provided code.",
