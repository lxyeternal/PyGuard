  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing and filtering Python source files based on directory, filename, and line length/range criteria.",
  "sources": "Reading os.path, os.walk, sysconfig.get_paths(), and re.search to determine file paths, directory contents, and name filtering.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions contain sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities; no data leaks or injections are evident.",
  "flows": "Source inputs include sources parameter (list of paths) and exclude list; flows involve filtering files based on name, directory, and extension; no flow leads to unsafe data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for file discovery and line range validation. It performs directory traversal with exclusion filters, filename filtering, and line length/range checks. Uses standard library functions and regex for filtering. No indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It simply facilitates project file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for managing Python source files with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
