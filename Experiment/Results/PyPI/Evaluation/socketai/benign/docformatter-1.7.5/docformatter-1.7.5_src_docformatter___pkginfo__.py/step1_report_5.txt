  "purpose": "Define package information and version for the 'docformatter' Python package.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code defining package metadata.",
  "targets": "No data is sent, received, or processed in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package metadata file with licensing information, comments, and a version variable. It contains no external input, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. It appears to be a typical module-level script for package metadata, with standard licensing and a version string. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely informational, serving as package metadata without any malicious intent or security risks.",
