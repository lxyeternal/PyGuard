  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely static metadata: license comments, version string, and a docstring.\n   - No input/output, external data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are identified.\n   - The code is standard for package metadata files.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident, given the nature of the code.\n   - The code's purpose is straightforward, and the analysis correctly reflects that.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they focus on the absence of malicious or suspicious code.\n   - The reasoning is sound and based on the static, metadata-only nature of the script.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward package metadata file with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
