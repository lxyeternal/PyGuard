  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata for 'docformatter', providing version info, licensing, and documentation without any executable logic.",
  "sources": "The static comments, version string '__version__', and module docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, non-executable module containing licensing comments, a version variable, and a docstring. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's transparency. The security risk score is 0, given the absence of security issues. The consistency across reports and the static nature of the code support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
