{
  "purpose": "The code provides package metadata and licensing information for the 'docformatter' project, primarily for documentation and version tracking.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions; no external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this code is static metadata without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard licensing and metadata comments, version assignment, and module docstring.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of license comments, a module-level docstring, a version variable assignment, and no executable logic. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or network activity. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The content appears typical for a package metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-formed metadata file with no signs of malicious behavior.",
