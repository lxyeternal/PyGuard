  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and normalizing docstrings and text in Python source code.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as lines, lines of text, and strings provided to normalization and splitting functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction; it operates solely on provided input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions that analyze, normalize, and split text, without any external data transmission or untrusted input affecting system state.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard text processing functions with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. No external network, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The module provides utility functions for handling docstrings and text normalization, including determining indentation, sentence beginning heuristics, line normalization, summary normalization, and splitting text into sentences or sections. The code uses common Python features and libraries, with no dynamic code execution or external interactions. Functions operate solely on input data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for text processing within documentation or code comments. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. It appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module.",
