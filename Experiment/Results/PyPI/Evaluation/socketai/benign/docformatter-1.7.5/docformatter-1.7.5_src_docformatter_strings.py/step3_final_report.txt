{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing and formatting Python docstrings and text lines, including indentation detection, sentence boundary detection, line normalization, and splitting summaries from descriptions.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings such as lines of text, summaries, and docstrings; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network operations, or handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed within functions, with no external data flows or untrusted data passing to sinks; the functions operate on provided parameters only.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the use of 'assert not isinstance(lines, str)', which is a standard validation check, not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward string processing functions for docstring normalization and analysis. It does not include external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The use of assertions is standard for validation. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are detected. The functions operate solely on input strings, with no side effects or external interactions. The overall structure and logic are clear and typical for documentation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for processing docstrings and text lines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security concern is the assertion statement, which is standard validation and does not pose a threat. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively zero.",
