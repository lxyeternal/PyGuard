{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite verifying the presence and types of constants related to quarantine attributes in the CoreServices framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined constants from the CoreServices module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only checks constant types.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely tests constants for their types, with no unusual code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system framework modules and defines a test class that asserts specific constants are of type string. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for verifying constants in the CoreServices framework. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
