  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward test suite for system API attributes and functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the minimal risk associated with controlled, system-level testing code."
