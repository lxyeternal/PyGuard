  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying the proper wrapping and functionality of CoreServices and related Apple frameworks in Python.",
  "sources": "No direct external data inputs; tests rely on internal attribute existence and function calls with hardcoded parameters.",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as LSGetExtensionInfo and _LSCopyAllApplicationURLs, which interact with system services and return data, but no untrusted data input is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test functions invoke system APIs with controlled parameters and verify expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Usage of system API functions with fixed parameters appears normal for a testing context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests checking for attribute presence, data types, and expected return values from system framework functions. There are no inputs from external sources or network interactions. Function calls use hardcoded parameters that seem consistent with system API usage. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration logic is present. The focus is on verifying system interface attributes and return values, typical for test code. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite intended for verifying the presence and correctness of system API attributes and functions. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious data flows, or security risks identified. It appears to be legitimate testing code with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
