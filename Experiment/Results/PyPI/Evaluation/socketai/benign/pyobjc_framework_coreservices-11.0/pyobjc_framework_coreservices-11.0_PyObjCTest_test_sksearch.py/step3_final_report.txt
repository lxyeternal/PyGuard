{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for macOS CoreServices Spotlight search API bindings via PyObjC. It tests constants, types, functions, and callback mechanisms using static data and URLs, with no untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "sources": "Static constants, URL creation with system file paths, data objects, and callback functions within the test suite.",
  "sinks": "Internal API calls, object creations, and callback invocations; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static files and constants into API functions; callbacks process search results internally without external leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Usage of callbacks and file URLs is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for system APIs, creating indexes, documents, and performing searches with callbacks. It operates solely within the system API scope, with no external or untrusted data inputs. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's structure and usage are consistent with legitimate testing practices, and the signals indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for macOS's CoreServices Spotlight search API, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security posture is benign, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero risk.",
