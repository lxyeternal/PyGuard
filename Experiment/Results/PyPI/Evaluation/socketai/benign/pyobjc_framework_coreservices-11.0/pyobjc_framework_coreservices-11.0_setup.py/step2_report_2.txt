  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malware. The analysis confirms that the code is typical for Python packaging, importing modules, modifying sys.path, and calling setup().\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code involves reading the current directory, modifying sys.path, and defining package metadata.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard for packaging, with no malicious elements. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The analysis confirms that the code is a typical setup script, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. It performs standard package configuration.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Justification:** The code's behavior is benign and standard, so the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it describes the code as a benign setup script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard packaging code, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious. No evidence of malware is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging macOS framework wrappers, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.**\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
