{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing Python wrappers for the CoreServices framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and pyobjc_setup; hardcoded package info and version strings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no execution of untrusted data, network calls, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static setup and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard packaging setup with no obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It modifies sys.path, imports setup tools, defines package info and dependencies, and calls setup(). No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python package distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It functions solely to package and distribute the CoreServices wrappers for macOS.",
