{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-CoreServices' library on macOS, defining package metadata, dependencies, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem paths, and module files during setup; imports standard modules and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling; no network or system calls that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration data flow from static package info into the setup process; no dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional Python setup script utilizing standard modules and conventions for packaging. It modifies sys.path for module discovery, defines package metadata, dependencies, and extension modules, all in a static and predictable manner. No runtime data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code aligns with typical packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
