  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines a setup script for packaging the pyobjc-framework-CoreServices.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads environment, modifies sys.path, sets up package info.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard packaging script, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1—package configuration.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads current directory, modifies sys.path, standard setup.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Packaging for CoreServices framework.\n- Sources & Flows: Standard imports, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard boilerplate, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Setup configuration for the package.\n- Sources & Flows: Static metadata, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical setup script, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar package setup.\n- Sources & Flows: Standard, static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard, benign script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python setup script for packaging macOS framework wrappers.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly zero, given the code's clarity.\n- The overall risk score is rightly zero, as the code performs no security-sensitive operations or data handling.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
