{
  "purpose": "To define a setup script for packaging and installing the pyobjc-framework-CoreServices library on macOS, providing wrappers for the CoreServices framework.",
  "sources": "The script reads environment variables, system paths, and module files such as '_CoreServices_inlines.m'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted input; it primarily sets up package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code mainly sets up the package without processing untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The script appears to be a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules, modifies sys.path, and defines package and extension metadata for building a Python package. It uses standard setup and extension constructs with no suspicious or obfuscated code. There are no runtime data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling involved. All parts conform to typical Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script for macOS frameworks. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the pyobjc project for framework bindings.",
