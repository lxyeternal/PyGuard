{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure the pyobjc-framework-CoreServices package, which provides Python bindings for macOS's CoreServices framework.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (os.path.dirname(__file__)) and system path modifications (sys.path.insert).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data, network, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules and modifying sys.path to setting up package metadata and extensions, with no untrusted data influencing security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard setup tasks without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and modifies sys.path to include the current directory, which is typical in setup scripts. It imports setup functions from pyobjc_setup and uses them to define package metadata, dependencies, and extensions. All operations are standard for Python package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or obfuscation. The dependencies and extension modules are related solely to macOS frameworks and are not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package providing bindings to macOS's CoreServices framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and typical for such packaging tasks.",
