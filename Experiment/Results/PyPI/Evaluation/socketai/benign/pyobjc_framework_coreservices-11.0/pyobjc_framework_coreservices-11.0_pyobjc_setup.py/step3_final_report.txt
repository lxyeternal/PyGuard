  "purpose": "Build, test, and package routines for the PyObjC framework on macOS, involving environment checks, system info retrieval, and dynamic test module loading.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'; environment variables; filesystem reads for SDK info; dynamic import of test modules based on filesystem patterns.",
  "sinks": "System commands for system info; file writes for build info; environment variable modifications; dynamic module imports for testing.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via subprocess influences build flags and SDK detection; environment variables affect compiler and build configurations; test modules loaded dynamically based on filesystem patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocesses for system info, dynamic test module import, environment variable manipulations are standard in build scripts; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and test setup routines for a macOS Python extension. Subprocess calls invoke system tools to gather environment and SDK info, which are used to configure build flags. Dynamic import of test modules is based on filesystem patterns, common in test suites. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity are evident. The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts, and environment manipulations are typical. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's nature and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
