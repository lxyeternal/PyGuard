  "purpose": "Verify that specific internal or sensitive attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module by asserting their absence.",
  "sources": "Attribute names checked via hasattr() calls within the test assertions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or effects involved.",
  "flows": "The code checks for attribute existence; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute 'TECPluginDispatchTable;' ends with a semicolon, which is unusual for attribute names but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static unit test that asserts certain attributes are not present in CoreServices. It uses straightforward hasattr() checks with no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be to prevent exposure of internal symbols, a common security or stability measure. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The attribute name with a semicolon should be verified for correctness, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign attribute verification test with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
