{
  "purpose": "Unit test class to ensure certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute names from the CoreServices module and calls hasattr() to check their existence.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Attribute name checks flow from test methods to attribute existence verification via hasattr(). No external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and solely for testing attribute exposure.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a test class with methods to verify that certain attribute names are not present in the CoreServices module. It uses hasattr() calls wrapped in assertions to enforce this. No external input, environment variables, or network activity is involved. The code appears to be a standard unit test intended for library safety verification, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test to confirm that specific attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module bindings. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
