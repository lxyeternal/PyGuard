{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for verifying that certain symbols from the CoreServices module are not exposed in Python bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined attribute names from the CoreServices module and checks their existence.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling the 'hasattr' function to check for attribute existence and asserting its value; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard test case with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscation or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system libraries and defines a test class that contains methods to verify the absence of specific attributes in the CoreServices module. The checks are straightforward assertions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code’s purpose seems to be security or integrity validation of the Python bindings, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite designed to verify that certain internal symbols are not exposed in bindings. There are no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks.",
