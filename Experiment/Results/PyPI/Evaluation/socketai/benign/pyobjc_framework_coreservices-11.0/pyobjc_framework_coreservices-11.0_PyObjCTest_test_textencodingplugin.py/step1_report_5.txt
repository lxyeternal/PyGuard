{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test case to verify that certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code inspects module attributes internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources are present; the code only performs assertions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static attribute checking.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs repetitive attribute checks, which is standard testing. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a core system module and testing utilities, then defines a test class with methods to ensure certain attributes are not present in the CoreServices module. It performs static assertions to verify attributes do not exist, likely to prevent exposing internal or sensitive API components. There are no dynamic inputs, no network calls, no credential handling, or other indicators of malicious activity. The pattern appears to be a standard safeguard in bindings or interface exposure checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test ensuring specific attributes are not exposed in the module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a security measure within a codebase to prevent exposing internal constants or identifiers.",
