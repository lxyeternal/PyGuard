  "purpose": "Unit testing to verify that certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for CoreServices; usage of hasattr checks within test_not_wrapped method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "Importing CoreServices, then checking for attributes; no data flow or external input/output.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs attribute existence checks, which is standard testing; no unusual behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system module and defines a test case class with methods that verify certain attributes are not present in the module. The tests are straightforward assertions ensuring attributes are not exposed, which is typical for compatibility or security reasons. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code structure and logic are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite verifying attribute exposure in a system library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
