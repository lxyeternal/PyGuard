  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreServices.MDLabel API in macOS, verifying data types, constants, and function behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreServices module, retrieves constants and functions, and uses test assertions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sources or sinks. No network or file system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Test assertions validate function return types and constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of expectedFailure suggests some tests are known to fail, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite verifying the existence and types of constants and functions within the CoreServices.MDLabel API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. All operations are read-only assertions on system API functions and constants. No external data, network calls, or system modifications are present. The use of decorators like @expectedFailure indicates anticipated test failures, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for macOS CoreServices API. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are identified.",
