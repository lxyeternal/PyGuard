{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test class designed to verify that certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute names from a predefined list within the test methods, specifically checking for the presence of specific attributes in CoreServices.",
  "sinks": "There are no typical data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted input; the code only performs attribute checks and assertions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking attributes in CoreServices (source) against expected absence; there is no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a repetitive pattern to ensure certain attributes are not present; no unusual or obfuscated code patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The function name 'assert_not_wrapped' is consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test case to verify that specific attribute names are not present in the CoreServices module, likely to prevent exposing internal or sensitive constants. The pattern is consistent and straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code. The test is purely for validation purposes and does not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or system modification. All attribute names checked are related to debug or internal identifiers. No suspicious behaviors, external interactions, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test designed to ensure certain internal attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
