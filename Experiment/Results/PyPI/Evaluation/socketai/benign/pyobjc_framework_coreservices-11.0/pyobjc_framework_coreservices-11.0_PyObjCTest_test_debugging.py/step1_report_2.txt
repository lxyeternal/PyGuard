  "purpose": "Unit testing to ensure certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module.",
  "sources": "Python module import (CoreServices), attribute checks via hasattr() within the TestCase class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; the code only performs attribute existence checks.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; only internal attribute checks and assertions are conducted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard unit test assertions without any suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework (CoreServices) and defines test cases to verify that specific attributes are not exposed in the module. It performs repeated attribute existence checks with assertions, which is a common testing pattern. There are no indications of data leaks, input handling, or external communication. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The purpose appears solely to ensure certain symbols are not exposed, which does not present security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test suite verifying attribute exposure in a system framework. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is benign and solely for testing purposes.",
