{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test class to verify that certain attributes are not exposed in the CoreServices module.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes from the CoreServices module and calls methods on the TestCase class.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking attributes of CoreServices; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs attribute existence checks, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data manipulation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs systematic checks to ensure specific attributes are not exposed within the CoreServices module. It imports system-level libraries and runs assertions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or system damage. The functions are straightforward and serve as safeguards against unintended attribute exposure. The overall structure is consistent with a standard unit test and contains no suspicious or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purpose-driven test suite verifying the absence of certain attributes in a module. It does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
