There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to remote URL dependencies, which are from reputable sources."

The minor security risk associated with sys.path modification is typical in development scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with common practices."
