{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to evaluate predicted denotations against target denotations in the WikiTableQuestions dataset, normalizing and matching strings, numbers, and dates.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include files read from the specified dataset directory and prediction files; the code reads TSV files and command-line arguments for prediction data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs evaluation results to standard output and warnings to standard error; it does not perform data leaks or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files (dataset and prediction files), processed into internal Value objects, and results are printed to stdout/stderr; no untrusted data is used in a way that influences system behavior beyond printing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are present. The code mainly performs string normalization, parsing, and comparison. The normalization functions are robust and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, uses well-structured functions for normalization, value parsing, and comparison, and processes data files and command-line input for evaluation. There is no evidence of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The normalization procedures are consistent with expected behavior, and all data processing appears safe. The code's sole purpose is dataset evaluation, and it outputs results via print statements. No functions or code sections suggest malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset evaluation script focused on string, number, and date normalization and matching. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
