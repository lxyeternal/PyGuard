{
  "purpose": "The code is an evaluator for the WikiTableQuestions dataset, designed to compare target denotations with predicted denotations for correctness, primarily used for evaluation in NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset files from specified directory and prediction files from specified path; processes data lines and converts string representations into structured Value objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or system effects; primarily reads and processes files, outputs evaluation metrics.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset -> processes and normalizes data -> stores in target_values_map -> reads predictions -> converts to Value objects -> compares with targets -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code uses standard libraries and does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file I/O operations for reading dataset and prediction files, normalization of text data, conversion to structured Value objects, and evaluation of correctness. The normalization functions remove diacritics, quotes, citations, parentheses, and whitespace issues, ensuring consistent comparison. The core logic is limited to data processing and comparison without any system manipulation or network activity. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. Overall, the code appears to be a benign evaluation script without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign evaluation utility for dataset correctness assessment. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
