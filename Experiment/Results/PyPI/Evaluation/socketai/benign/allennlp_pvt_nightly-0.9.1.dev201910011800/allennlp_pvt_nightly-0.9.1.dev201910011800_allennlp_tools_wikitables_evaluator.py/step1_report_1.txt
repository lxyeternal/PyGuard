{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to evaluate predicted denotations against target denotations for the WikiTableQuestions dataset, normalizing and matching various data types such as strings, numbers, and dates.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from TSV files in a specified dataset directory and from a prediction file; data is processed through normalization functions, parsing functions, and string manipulation routines.",
  "sinks": "The code writes evaluation results, warnings, and progress logs to standard output and standard error streams; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset files into in-memory data structures, through normalization and parsing functions, then into comparison functions for correctness evaluation; no external network or system commands are invoked during this process.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hidden backdoors, system calls, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms; the code appears to be straightforward dataset evaluation logic with standard normalization and parsing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data normalization, parsing, and comparison routines typical for dataset evaluation. It reads input from local files, processes strings, numbers, and dates, and outputs evaluation metrics and warnings. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network access, system modifications, or hidden functionalities. All functions are related to data normalization and comparison, with no signs of code injection, data theft, or other malware. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign dataset evaluation script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local files, normalizes data, and reports evaluation metrics. Its design and implementation do not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
