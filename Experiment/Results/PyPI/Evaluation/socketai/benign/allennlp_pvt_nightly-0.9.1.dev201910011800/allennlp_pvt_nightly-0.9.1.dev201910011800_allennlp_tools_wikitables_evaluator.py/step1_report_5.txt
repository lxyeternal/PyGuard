{
  "purpose": "This script evaluates predicted denotations against target denotations in the WikiTableQuestions dataset, normalizing and matching string, number, and date values.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from TSV files containing target values and from a prediction file containing model outputs. The code reads filenames from a directory and parses lines from TSV files and the prediction file.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs evaluation results to standard output, including correctness and accuracy metrics. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files; target values are stored in memory. Predicted values are generated from the prediction file, then compared with stored target values using normalization and matching functions. Results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard normalization and matching functions; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. No use of eval, exec, or system commands that could execute untrusted code is observed. The code is straightforward and designed for evaluation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script loads datasets and predictions, normalizes string, number, and date values, and checks for matches to evaluate accuracy. It reads files and directories securely, performs normalization to prevent malicious input manipulation, and outputs evaluation metrics. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code primarily processes data and performs string normalization, with standard Python libraries. Overall, the code appears purely for evaluation with no malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset evaluation script that normalizes and compares dataset values for correctness. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions as intended for its purpose, with no security concerns.",
