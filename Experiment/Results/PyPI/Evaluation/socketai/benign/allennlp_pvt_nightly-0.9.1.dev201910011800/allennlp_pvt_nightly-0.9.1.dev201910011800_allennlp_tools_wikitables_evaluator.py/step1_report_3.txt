{
  "purpose": "The code is a dataset evaluation script designed to compare predicted values against target values in the WikiTableQuestions dataset, normalizing and matching different data types such as strings, numbers, and dates.",
  "sources": "The code reads dataset files from a specified directory (`targeted-dataset-path`) and prediction files from a given path (`prediction_path`). It reads input data from TSV files, parsing lines for example IDs, target values, and predictions.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data but does not include any untrusted data sinks such as network communication, file writing other than reading, or executing external commands. No data is transmitted or written beyond reading input files and printing evaluation results.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files, unescaped and normalized; predictions are parsed and converted to internal representations; then, the code compares target and predicted values for correctness based on normalization and matching rules. The flow is straightforward data parsing and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The normalization functions include detailed text cleaning, but nothing suspicious is present. The code primarily performs data normalization and evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data reading from specified directories and files, normalizes textual data, converts data to various value types (string, number, date), and compares predictions against targets. It uses standard Python libraries and safe practices, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or external command execution. The functions for normalization and data parsing are well-structured and do not contain malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are detected. The only potential concern could be if the files read are maliciously crafted, but this is outside the code's control and not a security vulnerability of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard dataset evaluation script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It performs data normalization, parsing, and comparison for evaluation purposes. There are no security risks or malware indicators present. The overall security risk score is low.",
