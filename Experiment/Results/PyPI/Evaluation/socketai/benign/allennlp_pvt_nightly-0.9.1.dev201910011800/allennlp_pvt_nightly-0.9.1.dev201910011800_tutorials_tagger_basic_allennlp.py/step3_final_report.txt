{
  "purpose": "Standard POS tagging with AllenNLP, no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data from URLs and local files; no suspicious data sources.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data can lead to potential data leak or effect are typical data flows; no external commands or network activity beyond dataset download.",
  "flows": "Data flows from datasets to model, then to save/load operations; no external network communication or malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical AllenNLP pipeline for POS tagging, including dataset reading from URLs, vocabulary creation, model training, saving/loading, and inference. All libraries used are standard, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The data sources are reputable URLs, and the operations are routine for ML workflows. No obfuscation or covert channels are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP training and inference pipeline with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
