  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard sequence tagging training script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The security risk score could be conservatively set to 0.1, reflecting minimal external data dependency but no actual threat."
