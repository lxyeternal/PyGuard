  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious code, no obfuscated parts, and no malware. The only dynamic element is reading version info via `exec`, which is common practice.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The setup script appears safe and conventional.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on the use of `exec` to load version info. The report notes this as a potential concern but considers it standard practice.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is safe, with a minor concern about `exec`.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Highlights the use of `exec` as a potential security risk if `version.py` is compromised. No malicious code is present, but the use of `exec` is flagged as a possible vector.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3, which seems appropriate given the potential risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malware is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The use of `exec` warrants caution but is not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script and the commonality of `exec` usage.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting a low but present concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is considered safe, with the `exec` usage being the only minor concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the script performs typical setup tasks, with no suspicious behavior, network activity, or malicious code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard for a setup script, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Use of `exec`:** The only notable concern is the use of `exec` to load version info from `version.py`. While common, it could be exploited if `version.py` is compromised. However, in the context of a trusted codebase, this is a known pattern.\n- **Malware detection:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to `exec`, but still low overall.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature of the code and no malicious activity, a conservative but reasonable score would be **0.2**.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is the use of `exec` to load version info, which is a common but potentially risky pattern if `version.py` is compromised. Overall, the code appears safe, and the risk is minimal.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive assessment.",
