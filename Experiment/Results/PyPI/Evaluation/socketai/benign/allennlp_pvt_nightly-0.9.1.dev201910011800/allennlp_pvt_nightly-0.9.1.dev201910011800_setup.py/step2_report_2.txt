  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, noting that the dynamic execution of 'version.py' via `exec()` is common practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious code, no external data flows, and no hardcoded secrets. The use of `exec()` is typical for version management, assuming 'version.py' is trusted.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is typical for packaging, with no malicious behavior. It notes that the only dynamic code execution is `exec()` on 'version.py'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) perhaps reflecting caution about `exec()`, but still minimal. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; the minimal security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that the only potential concern is the use of `exec()` to evaluate 'version.py'. It correctly notes that if 'version.py' is compromised, malicious code could execute during setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.8.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is appropriate; the use of `exec()` is a known pattern but does pose a risk if the file is compromised. The score of 0.3 for securityRisk seems reasonable, considering the potential for malicious code if 'version.py' is tampered with.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is balanced and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, emphasizing that the only anomaly is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Evaluation:** Slightly lower risk score than Report 3, which is reasonable given the same reasoning. The confidence is high, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, notes that the code performs standard setup tasks, with `exec()` being the only notable point, which is common but not ideal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent with previous reports; the risk is minimal but acknowledges the potential concern with `exec()`.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No actual malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Main concern:** The use of `exec()` to load version info from 'version.py' — a common pattern but potentially risky if 'version.py' is compromised.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports align well with their reasoning. The security risk scores range from 0.1 to 0.3, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware or malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of `exec()` is standard but carries some risk if 'version.py' is compromised, a moderate score around **0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup script with a common pattern (`exec()` for version loading). While `exec()` can be risky if 'version.py' is tampered with, in typical controlled environments, this is acceptable. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n**Final note:** Ensure that 'version.py' remains secure and unaltered to mitigate the risk associated with `exec()`.",
