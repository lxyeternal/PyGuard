  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security concern is the use of exec to load version info, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if 'version.py' is tampered with. Overall, the package is safe for use, with the risk manageable by ensuring the integrity of 'version.py'."
