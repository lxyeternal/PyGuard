  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation for loading pretrained NLP models from trusted sources. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to remote URL dependencies, which are from reputable sources."
