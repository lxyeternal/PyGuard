{
  "purpose": "Defines functions to load pretrained NLP models from URLs and return specific predictors for various NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "URLs pointing to model archives on Amazon S3 and other cloud storage; load_archive function fetching models from these URLs.",
  "sinks": "Return statements returning predictor objects; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing visible.",
  "flows": "URLs are loaded via load_archive in each function; predictors are instantiated from these loaded archives and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present. Use of standard warnings catch block and predictable URL loading.",
  "analysis": "The code loads machine learning model archives from publicly accessible URLs on Amazon S3, then creates and returns predictor objects for various NLP tasks. No dynamic code execution, no network communication after loading, and no suspicious data handling are present. URLs appear to be legitimate model hosting points. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations. The code structure is straightforward and conforms to typical model loading patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely loads pretrained models from trusted URLs and returns predictor objects without any malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be standard code for setting up NLP models using the AllenNLP library.",
