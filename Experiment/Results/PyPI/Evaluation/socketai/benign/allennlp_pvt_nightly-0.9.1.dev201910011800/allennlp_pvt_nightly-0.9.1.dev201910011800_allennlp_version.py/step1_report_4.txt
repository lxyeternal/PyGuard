  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using hardcoded strings.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to _MAJOR, _MINOR, and _REVISION variables.",
  "sinks": "String formatting to create VERSION_SHORT and VERSION variables.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version components to variables, then formatting into version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static string values to version component variables and formats them into version strings. There are no external inputs, no user input, no network interactions, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The inclusion of 'unreleased' in the revision string is typical for development versions, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of version labeling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
