  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Constants assigning version components and string formatting statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version components into version strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an 'unreleased' tag in the revision string is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _REVISION). It then constructs version strings using the format method. No input handling, no external data, and no dynamic code execution are present. The inclusion of 'unreleased' as part of the version revision is common for indicating development versions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines version strings for a package.",
