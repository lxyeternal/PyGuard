  "sinks": "String formatting operations for VERSION_SHORT and VERSION, but these are safe and do not involve untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of hardcoded version components into formatted version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses straightforward string assignments and formatting with hardcoded values.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to version component variables, then constructs version strings via format. No input reading, no untrusted data handling, no external calls, and no suspicious or obfuscated behavior are present. The code's purpose appears to be to define version metadata for a package.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It is standard version declaration code, with no security concerns.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues.",
