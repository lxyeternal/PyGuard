  "drops": "Formatting of version strings using the defined components.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned string values; VERSION_SHORT and VERSION are constructed from these values.",
  "anomalies": "The _REVISION variable contains '1-unreleased', which is unusual for a version string but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to variables representing version components. The _REVISION includes a non-numeric suffix 'unreleased', which may indicate development status but does not pose a security risk. The code constructs version strings for display or logging. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected based solely on version string definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward version string assignment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is the non-numeric revision identifier, which is not suspicious in this context.",
