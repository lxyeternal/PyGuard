  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code assigns static string values to version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _REVISION), with _REVISION set to \"1-unreleased\".\n- The code then constructs version strings (VERSION_SHORT and VERSION) via string formatting.\n- There are no signs of dynamic input, external data, or malicious code.\n- The only unusual aspect is the _REVISION value \"1-unreleased\", which indicates a development or pre-release state but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of \"unreleased\" in the revision string is typical for development versions and does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only \"anomaly\" noted is the non-numeric revision string, which is common in development cycles.\n- No logical flaws, code errors, or security flaws are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- The scores seem consistent and reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious code, no external data handling, and no security flaws, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified because there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The presence of \"unreleased\" in the revision string is a normal development indicator, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration snippet with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary to the scores or conclusions. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the \"unreleased\" suffix, which is typical for development versions and does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.",
