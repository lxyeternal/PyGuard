  "purpose": "Defines version components as static strings and constructs version strings for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string literals to _MAJOR, _MINOR, and _REVISION variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input used.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version components into VERSION_SHORT and VERSION strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '1-unreleased' in _REVISION, indicating a development version, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version components with no dynamic input, external data, or obfuscation. The 'unreleased' suffix in _REVISION is typical for development versions and does not pose security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The inclusion of 'unreleased' is standard for development versions and does not indicate any security threat. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
