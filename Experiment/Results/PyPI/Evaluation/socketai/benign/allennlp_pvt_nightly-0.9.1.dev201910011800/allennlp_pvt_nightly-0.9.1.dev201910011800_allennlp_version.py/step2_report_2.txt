  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code assigns static string literals to `_MAJOR`, `_MINOR`, and `_REVISION`.\n- The `_REVISION` is set to `'1-unreleased'`, which is unconventional but indicates a development or pre-release state.\n- The version strings are constructed via string formatting, with no dynamic or external data involved.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Correctly states that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent. The unusual `_REVISION` value is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or 0). The report's score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is static, with no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's score is 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is benign, with an unconventional `_REVISION` but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's score is 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard version string definition with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's score is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others; straightforward static version assignment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's score is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** Only if the `_REVISION` contained malicious payloads or dynamic code, which it does not.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The only noteworthy aspect is the `'1-unreleased'` revision string, which is typical for development versions and not suspicious.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the current scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
