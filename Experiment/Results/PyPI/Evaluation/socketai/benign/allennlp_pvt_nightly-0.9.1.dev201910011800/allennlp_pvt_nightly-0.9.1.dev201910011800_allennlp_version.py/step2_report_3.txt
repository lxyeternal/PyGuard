  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code only assigns static string literals to version components and formats them into version strings.\n- The _REVISION includes '1-unreleased', which indicates a development or pre-release state, not malicious.\n- No inputs, external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or signs of malicious intent are present.\n- All reports agree on these points, and the confidence level is high (1).\n\n**Specific points to consider:**\n\n1. **Presence of 'unreleased' in _REVISION:**\n   - Unusual but common in development versions.\n   - Not inherently suspicious or malicious.\n   - No security risk associated with this practice.\n\n2. **Malware score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, this seems appropriate.\n   - No indication of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Obfuscated score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward.\n\n4. **Security risk score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or reasoning flaws:**\n- The reports do not consider that the _REVISION string could be used maliciously if, for example, it were dynamically generated or fetched from untrusted sources. But in this static assignment, that concern does not apply.\n- No mention of version validation or enforcement, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The 'unreleased' tag is typical for development versions and not suspicious.\n- The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward version string declaration with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are needed.",
