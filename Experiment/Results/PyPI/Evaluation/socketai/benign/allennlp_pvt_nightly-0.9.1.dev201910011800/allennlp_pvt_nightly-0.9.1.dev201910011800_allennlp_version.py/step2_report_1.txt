  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and assessing the potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe static assignment of version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _REVISION) with no dynamic input, external data, or complex logic.\n- The only anomaly noted is the inclusion of 'unreleased' in _REVISION, which is common for development versions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly assigns string literals and formats version strings. The presence of '1-unreleased' in _REVISION is unusual but not malicious or harmful.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No input handling, no external data, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Risk assessment:** The minimal security risk score of 0 aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The inclusion of 'unreleased' is typical for development versions and does not imply any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard. The scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
