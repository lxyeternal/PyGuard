  "purpose": "Define version strings for a software package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _REVISION)",
  "sinks": "Formatting of version strings into VERSION_SHORT and VERSION",
  "flows": "Variables _MAJOR, _MINOR, _REVISION -> formatted into VERSION_SHORT and VERSION",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'unreleased' in _REVISION, which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string values to version components, with _REVISION set to '1-unreleased', possibly indicating a development or pre-release state. It then formats these components into version strings. No user input, network access, or data manipulation is present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected. The code appears to be a standard version declaration with an unconventional revision string, but nothing malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to define version strings for the package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
