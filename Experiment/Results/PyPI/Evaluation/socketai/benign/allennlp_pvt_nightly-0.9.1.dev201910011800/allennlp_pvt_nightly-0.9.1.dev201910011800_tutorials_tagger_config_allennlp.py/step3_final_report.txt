  "purpose": "Implement a standard NLP POS tagging pipeline using AllenNLP, including data reading, model training, and prediction.",
  "sources": "File input via 'cached_path' during data reading, temporary directories for training outputs, local prediction calls.",
  "sinks": "No data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data read from files (local or remote via cached_path) → processed through AllenNLP pipeline → predictions output locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'cached_path' could fetch remote data; use of 'shutil.rmtree' on temp directories is standard cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical NLP sequence tagging implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or backdoors are present. The use of 'cached_path' introduces a minor potential security concern if fetching untrusted remote data, but this is standard practice and not malicious. Temporary directory cleanup with 'shutil.rmtree' is normal. The code structure and library usage are straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate NLP pipeline with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score (0.1) due to remote data fetching is justified but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
