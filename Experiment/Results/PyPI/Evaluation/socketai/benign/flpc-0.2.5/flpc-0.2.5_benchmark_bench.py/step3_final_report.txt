{
  "purpose": "The code benchmarks regex functions from 'flpc' and 're' modules using internally generated random data to compare performance.",
  "sources": "Generates random text using 'choices' from 'string' module; reads pattern and text data for regex operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data exfiltration; all operations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Pattern compilation and matching functions process the generated text; data flows within the script without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward benchmarking logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs performance benchmarking of regex functions with internally generated data, with no external or untrusted inputs. It uses standard libraries and a custom 'flpc' module. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code is purely for performance measurement, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign performance benchmarking utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward script. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
