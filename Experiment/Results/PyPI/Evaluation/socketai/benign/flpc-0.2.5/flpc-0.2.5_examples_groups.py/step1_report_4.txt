{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of the 'flpc' library for pattern compilation, searching, matching, iterating, and replacing text based on regex patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded strings such as 'Hello World' and 'Hello World Hello Python'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are printed to the console; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The input strings are used as source data; the results of regex operations (matches, groups, replacements) are printed, but no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors are detected. The 'flpc' library appears to be used for regex operations similar to 're', with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'flpc' library and performs standard regex compilation, search, findall, finditer, and substitution functions on static strings. There are no inputs from external sources, no network connections, and no handling of untrusted data. The operations are typical for text processing. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears straightforward and benign, with clear intent to perform regex operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal regex usage example using the 'flpc' library, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely operates on static strings and outputs results locally.",
