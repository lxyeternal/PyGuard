{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the 'flpc' library for pattern compilation, searching, finding all matches, iterating over matches, and substitution using regex-like operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the string \"Hello World\" and \"Hello World Hello Python\" within the search, findall, finditer, and sub functions.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console; no data leaks or untrusted data effects are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are fed into 'search', 'findall', 'finditer', and 'sub' functions; the results are printed or stored. There are no untrusted data flows leading to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and typical for pattern matching operations. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'flpc' library functions to compile a regex pattern, search for matches, retrieve all matches, iterate over matches, and perform substitutions. All operations involve static strings, with no user input or external data sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a simple regex utility demonstration. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of regex pattern compilation and matching operations using 'flpc'. It shows no malicious intent or security risks. There are no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
