{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the 'flpc' library for compiling regex patterns, searching, finding all matches, iterating over matches, and substituting matched patterns in text.",
  "sources": "Reads input string \"Hello World\" and \"Hello World Hello Python\" for pattern matching and substitution.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print, which display match groups and replaced text; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by 'search', 'findall', 'finditer', and 'sub' functions; outputs are printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual dynamic code execution detected. The library 'flpc' appears to be a standard regex-like utility.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'flpc', which seems to serve regex operations similar to 're'. All operations are standard pattern compilation, searching, finding, and substitution. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions operate on static input strings with no external or untrusted data sources, and outputs are printed locally. There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard regex operations using 'flpc' with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign example of pattern matching and substitution. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
