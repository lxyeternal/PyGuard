{
  "purpose": "The code sets up custom roles and options for reStructuredText directives used in Sphinx documentation, specifically for code blocks and IPython directives.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration, import statements, and roles from source modules; accesses optional IPython extension import.",
  "sinks": "Modifies option_spec dictionaries of directive classes with new options; no data sinks or external outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Imports roles and adds custom options to directive classes during setup; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present; conditional import handles missing optional dependency gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs import operations and modifies class attributes to add custom roles. The import of IPython extension is optional and handled safely. The addition of options to directive classes appears standard for extending Sphinx directives. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It is a straightforward extension setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration extension for Sphinx documentation, adding custom roles and options. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
