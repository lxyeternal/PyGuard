{
  "purpose": "This code configures a Sphinx extension by adding custom roles to specific directive classes for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from imported modules, class attributes (SOURCEBLOCK_ROLES, CHECKER_ROLES), and the app parameter in the setup function.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the option_spec attribute of directive classes, which could influence how options are processed but does not directly handle untrusted data or perform output actions.",
  "flows": "The add_custom_roles function takes a directive class, iterates over role lists, and adds options to its option_spec. The setup function invokes this for CodeBlock and possibly IPythonDirective.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code conditionally imports IPythonDirective, which is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly sets up configuration for a Sphinx documentation project, adding specific options to directives based on roles. The import handling is safe and common. No network, data transmission, or system manipulation occurs. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension setup for Sphinx, adding custom roles to directives for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
