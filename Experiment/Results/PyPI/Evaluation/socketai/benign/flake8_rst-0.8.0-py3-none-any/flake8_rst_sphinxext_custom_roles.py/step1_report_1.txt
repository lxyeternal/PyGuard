  "purpose": "This code adds custom roles to directives for syntax highlighting and IPython integration in a Sphinx documentation setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from docutils, sphinx, and local modules; conditional import of IPython extension.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "The code modifies directive classes to include new option specifications but does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for adding roles to directives, conditionally importing an optional IPython extension, and applying role modifications during setup. It is straightforward and focused on configuration without any external input or data processing that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical configuration setup for Sphinx extensions and does not contain malicious code or security risks. It simply enhances documentation directives with additional roles. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are detected.",
