{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing, file handling, or network operations without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files, environment variables, or network interfaces; no suspicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network endpoints; no untrusted data flows leading to vulnerabilities detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) without suspicious transformations or malicious manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors supports a benign assessment. The high confidence scores reflect thorough review. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the data flow is typical for standard scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is set to 0. The overall assessment indicates a low-security threat level, consistent with the provided analysis.",
