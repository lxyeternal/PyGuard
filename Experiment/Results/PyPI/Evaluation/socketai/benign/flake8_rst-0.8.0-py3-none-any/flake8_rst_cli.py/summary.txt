  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external Application's implementation. Scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: approximately 0.1–0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
