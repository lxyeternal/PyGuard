  "purpose": "Command-line interface for executing the flake8_rst application.",
  "sources": "Imports application from flake8_rst; reads command-line arguments via argv parameter.",
  "sinks": "Calls app.run(argv), which may process command-line input; calls app.exit().",
  "flows": "argv is passed from main to app.run, which may process external input; then app.exit() terminates the application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and relies on the external application logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports an application module, defines a main function that initializes and runs an Application instance, passing command-line arguments. It then exits cleanly. No untrusted data handling, data leaks, or malicious code is evident. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a simple wrapper for executing the flake8_rst application. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line entry point for the flake8_rst application, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly delegates processing to the imported application module. Overall, it appears safe.",
