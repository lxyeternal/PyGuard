  "purpose": "A utility for parsing, cleaning, and manipulating Python source code, especially in IPython/Jupyter environments, to extract or modify code blocks and roles.",
  "sources": "Code strings, bootstrap code, regex matches for IPython prompts and magic commands, environment detection modules.",
  "sinks": "Regex-based transformations, code modifications via 'transform_cell', source code extraction and merging.",
  "flows": "Source code input flows into regex matching, cleaning functions, and source merging; 'transform_cell' modifies code in cleaning steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex and 'transform_cell' for code cleaning, which could theoretically be misused but are standard practices; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for parsing, cleaning, and managing code blocks in IPython/Jupyter notebooks. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, uses regex to identify IPython prompts and roles, and employs 'transform_cell' for cleaning console syntax. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The regex manipulations are typical for sanitization, not malicious intent. The source flows into cleaning functions, and the code structure is clear. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for parsing and cleaning Python source code in notebook environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the minimal potential for misuse of regex transformations, but overall, the code is safe.",
