  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the assessments, and then synthesize an overall security evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- The code is primarily a parser for source code and documentation blocks, using regex to identify code snippets and docstrings.\n- It employs decorators to organize, group, and annotate these blocks.\n- The `SourceBlock` class (not provided here) appears to be a container or parser for code snippets.\n- No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code patterns are evident.\n- The regex patterns are standard for parsing code and documentation structures.\n- The code does not perform any file modifications, system calls, or other side effects that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Parsing and grouping code blocks, benign.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign parser, no security issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar parsing of source code blocks, benign.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Again, a parser for code snippets, documentation.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign parser.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar code block extraction, benign.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same as above, parsing and grouping code snippets.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate parser.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Consistency Check:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign `0`. Given the code's nature—parsing, grouping, cleaning code snippets—there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior. The absence of dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code supports this.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are `0`, which aligns with the code's clarity and straightforward regex parsing.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—this is reasonable given the code's benign purpose.\n- **Flow & logic:** The code is consistent across reports, and the reasoning aligns with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior, a risk score of **0.1–0.2** is appropriate; perhaps slightly lower to **0.1** for minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, well-structured parser for documentation and source code snippets. It does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden payloads. The minor risk score accounts for the general complexity and potential for misuse if integrated into a larger system, but as-is, it appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the `SourceBlock` class and any external modules are also scrutinized for malicious code, but based solely on the provided code, the assessment is that this is a benign, standard parser utility.",
