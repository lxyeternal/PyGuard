{
  "purpose": "This code extends flake8 to process reStructuredText files, extract source code blocks, and perform style checks with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from source blocks via find_sourcecode, file reading in FileProcessor, and options via roles.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting through self.results, modification of options via inject_options, and source code extraction.",
  "flows": "Source code is extracted from source blocks, options are injected based on roles, and errors are appended to results during reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Dynamic options injection is standard but could be misused if roles are manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate flake8 extension for processing reStructuredText files, with source code extraction, dynamic options injection, and error reporting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic options pattern is common and not inherently malicious. The source code handling and attribute manipulations are standard. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low security risk primarily due to configurable options, which is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension for flake8 with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior and structure.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
