  "purpose": "Minimal CLI launcher that imports 'cli' from 'flake8_rst' and executes 'cli.main()' to run the package via command line.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from flake8_rst import cli' and the call to 'cli.main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli.main()' which depends on external package implementation; no direct data sinks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' from 'flake8_rst' → invocation of 'cli.main()' which executes external code.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and function call with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI entry point that relies on the external 'flake8_rst' package. It does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk and malware likelihood depend entirely on the trustworthiness of 'flake8_rst' and its 'cli.main()' implementation. The code itself is benign, with no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The minimal nature and external dependency mean the malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk score (around 0.2) to reflect dependency trust considerations. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI wrapper relying on an external package. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is low, primarily dependent on the external package's integrity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate.",
