  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI wrapper relying on an external package. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is low, primarily dependent on the external package's integrity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate."
