{
  "purpose": "This module provides an entry point to run the 'flake8_rst' CLI tool via the command 'python -m flake8 ...'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'cli' from 'flake8_rst' and calling 'cli.main()'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli.main()' which likely executes code within the 'flake8_rst' package's CLI logic.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' from 'flake8_rst' → invocation of 'cli.main()' → execution of code within 'flake8_rst' package's main function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation present. The call to 'cli.main()' depends entirely on the imported package's implementation, which could potentially be malicious if the package itself is malicious, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI handler from 'flake8_rst' and invokes its main function, effectively acting as an entry point for the 'flake8_rst' command-line tool. There are no hidden or suspicious elements within this minimal code. The security of this code depends on the trustworthiness of the 'flake8_rst' package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet alone, but if 'flake8_rst' were compromised, executing 'cli.main()' could execute malicious code. Since the code is straightforward and simple, the risk is limited to the trustworthiness of the imported package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper to invoke the 'flake8_rst' CLI. It does not contain any inherently malicious code, but it relies on an external package. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone.",
