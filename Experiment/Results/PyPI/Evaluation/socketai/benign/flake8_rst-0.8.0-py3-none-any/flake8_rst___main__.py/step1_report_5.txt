{
  "purpose": "The module provides an entry point for running the flake8_rst CLI tool via 'python -m'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'cli' from 'flake8_rst' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli.main()' function which executes the CLI command logic.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli', then execution of 'cli.main()' to run the CLI tool.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI object from the 'flake8_rst' package and executes its 'main()' method, which is typical for CLI entry point scripts. There is no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, or network activity evident. The package 'flake8_rst' is known for integrating reStructuredText with flake8 and is publicly available, with no indication of malicious intent. The code structure is standard and simple, indicating no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple entry point for executing the 'flake8_rst' CLI tool. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
