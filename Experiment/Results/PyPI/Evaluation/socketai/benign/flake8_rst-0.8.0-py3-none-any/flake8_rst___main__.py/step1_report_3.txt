{
  "purpose": "The module is designed to invoke the CLI main function of the 'flake8_rst' package, likely to run linting or code analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it simply imports a module and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import to function call without any data manipulation or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' component from 'flake8_rst' and executes its main() function, serving as an entry point for a command-line interface. There are no input or output streams, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical wrapper for CLI invocation. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script to invoke a CLI command from the 'flake8_rst' package. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, straightforward module.",
