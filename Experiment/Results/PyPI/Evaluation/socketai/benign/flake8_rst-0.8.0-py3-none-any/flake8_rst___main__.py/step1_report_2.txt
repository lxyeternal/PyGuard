{
  "purpose": "This module allows the user to run flake8 with the rst plugin via command line.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from flake8_rst import cli' and 'cli.main()' invocation.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import retrieves the CLI object, and 'cli.main()' executes the command-line interface; no untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present; the code is straightforward and typical for a CLI module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' module from 'flake8_rst' and calls its 'main()' function to run the command-line interface. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. The structure is simple and intended for executing a CLI command. It does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, nor does it perform any network operations or file manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI launcher module for 'flake8_rst' with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
