  "purpose": "Declare the version of the module or package as '0.8.0'.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None, no data flows or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, since the code only sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string value to the variable '__version__'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no output sinks, and no suspicious constructs. The assignment is typical for package versioning and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or hidden code present. Given the simplicity, there are no security concerns or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
