  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package as a string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "The assignment is direct with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple variable assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input/output, data flow, or complex logic. All reports confirm its benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
