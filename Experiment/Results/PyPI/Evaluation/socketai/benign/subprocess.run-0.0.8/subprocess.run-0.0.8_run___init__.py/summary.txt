  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, functional utility for executing chained shell commands, with no malware or obfuscation. Its primary security concern is the potential for command injection if external inputs are incorporated without validation. Proper input sanitization and cautious usage are recommended to mitigate risks. The existing reports and scores are consistent and appropriate."
