{
  "purpose": "This module manages Data Observatory tokens within the CARTO platform, providing classes for token representation and management.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings (API version and endpoint), class attributes, and imported modules. No external input handling or data reading observed.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data. No network or file I/O operations involving untrusted input shown in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets aside from standard static strings. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing tokens with fields that are likely to hold sensitive data but are statically defined as class attributes. The API endpoint is formatted using static constants. The get method calls a parent method with a fixed string 'token', with no user input involved. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data model and management classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not read untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain malicious logic.",
