  "purpose": "Module for managing Data Observatory tokens within an API client, defining resource and manager classes with static configuration.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions for API version and endpoint; class attributes; method calling superclass with fixed string 'token'.",
  "sinks": "The get() method calls super().get('token'), which depends on parent class implementation; no direct untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The get() method retrieves a token resource via superclass method, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions, static strings, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models and resource management classes for API tokens, using static configuration and simple method calls. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of fixed strings and static fields indicates standard API client code. The get() method's reliance on superclass behavior is typical; without parent class code, no risk is inferred. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low risk score reflects minimal concern due to static configuration and straightforward design.",
