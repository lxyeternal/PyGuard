{
  "purpose": "The code manages CARTO datasets, including creation, deletion, and synchronization with external sources, via API interactions and internal data management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URLs (for remote files and sync sources), function parameters, and external API responses during dataset creation and deletion.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include API request calls, file operations, and data exchanges via network (e.g., API requests, sleep calls for polling).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (URLs, import arguments) to API requests and internal object manipulations, including dataset creation, deletion, and status polling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code properly handles exceptions and polling logic without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard dataset management functions: creating datasets from files or URLs, deleting datasets with validation, and polling for operation completion. It uses API calls with proper exception handling, retries, and status checks. No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network behavior is found. The use of sleep-based polling and exception handling indicates conventional API interaction patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. External API interactions are well-structured and do not appear malicious. The overall flow is consistent with legitimate dataset management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of dataset management via API calls, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage. It performs expected operations such as creation, deletion, and status polling securely and transparently. The code has a low malware score and minimal security concerns.",
