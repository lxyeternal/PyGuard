{
  "purpose": "The code manages CARTO datasets via API interactions, including creation, deletion, and polling for job completion.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'archive', 'interval', 'import_args', and API response attributes like 'state' and 'visualization_id'.",
  "sinks": "API requests for dataset creation, deletion, and status checks; dataset identifiers used to fetch details.",
  "flows": "Inputs influence API calls; dataset IDs retrieved and used to access dataset details; polling with sleep waits for job completion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dangerous system calls; polling with sleep is standard but could be exploited for DoS.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API-based dataset management, with exception handling and polling mechanisms. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Error messages include internal details, which could leak info but are typical in such implementations. The use of sleep in polling is common but can be misused for DoS; however, this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK component for managing datasets through API calls. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to the polling sleep and error message leakage, but these are typical and do not significantly elevate risk. The overall security posture is sound.",
