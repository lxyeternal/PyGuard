  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code manages CARTO datasets via API interactions, with functions for creation, deletion, and polling.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, such as code injection, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors, are identified.\n- The code uses standard practices like retries, sleep-based polling, and exception handling.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behaviors.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minor concerns like error message leakage or potential denial-of-service via sleep loops, but these are typical and not malicious.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, nor does it perform any dangerous operations like system calls or code injection.\n- API requests are constructed from parameters, but no evidence suggests manipulation for malicious purposes.\n- The polling mechanism is standard; while it could be exploited for DoS, this is a common pattern and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n\n**Potential issues and reasoning:**\n\n- The reports mention the use of sleep loops and exception messages that could leak internal error details. These are acknowledged as minor security considerations but do not constitute malware or malicious activity.\n- The code's purpose and logic are consistent with legitimate SDK functions for dataset management.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable; minor security concerns are acknowledged but do not indicate significant risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured SDK component for managing datasets via API.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The minor security risks are typical for such operations and do not elevate the overall risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2**\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code review. The overall security posture appears sound, with only minor, common concerns.",
