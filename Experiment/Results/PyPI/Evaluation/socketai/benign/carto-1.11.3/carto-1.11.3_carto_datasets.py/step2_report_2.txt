  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code manages datasets, reading parameters like 'archive', 'interval', 'import_args', and API response attributes such as 'state' and 'visualization_id'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests and dataset identifiers are used appropriately; no direct data leaks or dangerous commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of `time.sleep()` in polling, which is standard but can be exploited for DoS if misused.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, which seems reasonable given the analysis. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages datasets, reading from parameters and API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API interactions are standard; no evidence of untrusted data being written to sensitive outputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. The use of sleep for polling is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, matching the previous report. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard dataset management with input parameters and API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, exception handling, sleep loops—all typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Error message leakage is a minor concern but common.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, consistent with previous assessments. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—dataset management via API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, retries, exception handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or secrets. Use of sleep is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, aligned with prior reports. Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid reasoning. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general pattern—dataset creation/deletion with API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API interactions, retries, exception handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The use of sleep and retries is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, consistent with others. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is consistent across reports, reflecting minor security concerns mainly related to sleep-based polling and error message leakage, which are typical and not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor security considerations, but nothing serious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK component for managing datasets via API calls, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
