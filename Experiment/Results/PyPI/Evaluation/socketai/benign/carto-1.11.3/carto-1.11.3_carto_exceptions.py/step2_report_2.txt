  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code defines two exception classes: `CartoException` and `CartoRateLimitException`.\n- The `CartoRateLimitException` extracts rate limit info from response headers and provides a static method to identify rate-limited responses.\n- The code relies on the `requests` library's response object.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It functions as intended for error handling and rate limit detection.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected. The code follows standard practices.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature observed.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security risks or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- It simply reads response headers and raises exceptions accordingly.\n- The static method `is_rate_limited` performs a straightforward check on response status and headers.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
