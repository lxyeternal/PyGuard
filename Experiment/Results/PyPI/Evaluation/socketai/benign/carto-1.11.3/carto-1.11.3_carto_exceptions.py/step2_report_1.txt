  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines custom exception classes for handling CARTO API errors, especially rate limiting.\n- They highlight that the code reads response headers and status codes from the 'requests' library's Response object.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code employs standard patterns for exception handling and rate limit detection.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, indicating benign intent.\n\n**Confirmations and observations:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- It does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or dynamic code execution.\n- The extraction of headers and response text is typical for error handling.\n- The static method `is_rate_limited` correctly checks for rate limiting based on status code and headers.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues are identified in the code logic or implementation.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of headers like 'Carto-Rate-Limit-Limit' and 'Retry-After' is appropriate and consistent with API rate limiting practices.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, well-structured, and standard for its purpose.\n- The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of exception handling for API rate limiting. It presents no security concerns or malicious intent.",
