  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for handling API errors, specifically rate limiting, in the carto-python library. It correctly reads response headers and status codes, raises exceptions, and provides a static method to identify rate-limited responses. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and well-structured. They note the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate. The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no anomalies, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on standard practices and observations. There are no unwarranted assumptions or speculative claims.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are 0 or 1 where appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Work-through Summary**:  \n- The code is straightforward and aligns with best practices.  \n- No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
