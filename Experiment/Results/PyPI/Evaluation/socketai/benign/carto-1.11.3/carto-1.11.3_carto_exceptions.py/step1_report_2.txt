{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the CARTO Python SDK, including rate limiting scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'response' object passed to the constructor and the static method, specifically accessing response.headers and response.status_code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code mainly processes and raises exceptions based on response data.",
  "flows": "The code processes the response object to determine if a rate limit error occurred, then raises or checks exceptions accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code uses standard patterns for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for handling errors from the CARTO API, particularly rate limits. It reads response headers to extract rate limit info and provides a static method to identify rate-limited responses. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The approach is standard, safe, and well-structured, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is standard for handling HTTP response errors, specifically rate limiting, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
