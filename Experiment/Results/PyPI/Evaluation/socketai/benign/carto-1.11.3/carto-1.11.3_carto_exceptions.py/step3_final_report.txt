{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for handling CARTO API errors, particularly rate limiting scenarios.",
  "sources": "Response headers such as 'Carto-Rate-Limit-Limit', 'Carto-Rate-Limit-Remaining', 'Retry-After', and 'Carto-Rate-Limit-Reset' from the requests.models.Response object.",
  "sinks": "The exception constructor and static method access response headers and status code; no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Response status code and headers are read in the constructor and static method to determine if rate limiting applies; no data flows outside the response object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with the main class extracting rate limit info from response headers and providing a static method to identify rate-limited responses. It employs standard practices for error handling and API response analysis. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The header accesses assume headers are present; potential for runtime errors exists if headers are missing, but this does not imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or other malicious activities. It is a typical implementation for API error handling, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception handling for API rate limiting. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
