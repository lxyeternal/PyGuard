{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors and rate limiting responses in the carto-python library.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'codes' object from the 'requests' library; reads response headers and status code in CartoRateLimitException.",
  "sinks": "Accesses response.headers to retrieve rate limit information; uses response.text for exception message.",
  "flows": "Response object is passed to CartoRateLimitException, which extracts headers and status code; is_rate_limited checks response headers for rate limiting conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or misleading code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with standard Python practices, utilizing response headers and status codes from the 'requests' library to manage API rate limits. It employs straightforward logic to identify rate-limited responses. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. Usage of response data is typical for error handling and rate limit management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling, specifically rate limiting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is benign and well-structured.",
