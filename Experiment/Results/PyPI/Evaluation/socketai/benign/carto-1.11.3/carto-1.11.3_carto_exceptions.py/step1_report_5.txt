{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling errors related to CARTO API interactions, including rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Reads response objects from the requests library, specifically response status codes, headers, and text.",
  "sinks": "Uses response headers to parse rate limit information; no sinks for untrusted data affecting system behavior.",
  "flows": "Response object is checked for rate limit status; headers are parsed to extract rate limit info, and exceptions are raised based on response data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes, primarily for handling API rate limiting errors. The CartoRateLimitException class extracts rate limit info from response headers and raises an exception accordingly. The is_rate_limited static method checks if the response indicates a rate limit breach by examining the status code and headers. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of the requests library is standard, and the handling of headers and response data appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception handling implementation for API rate limiting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and safe for its purpose.",
