  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling CARTO API errors, particularly rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Reads HTTP response objects, specifically response.status_code, response.headers, and response.text.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not perform any dangerous operations or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Response object is checked for rate limit conditions; exception initialized with response text; headers are parsed for rate limit info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward and aligns with standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for CARTO API errors, especially rate limiting scenarios. The CartoRateLimitException class extracts rate limit details from the response headers and provides a method to check if a response is rate-limited. It relies on standard libraries and performs no unsafe operations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception handling for API rate limits with no malicious intent or security risks.",
