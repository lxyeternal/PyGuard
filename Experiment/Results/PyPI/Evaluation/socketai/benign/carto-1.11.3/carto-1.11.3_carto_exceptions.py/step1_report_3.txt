  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling errors, especially rate limiting, in the carto-python library.",
  "sources": "Reads response object from the requests library, specifically response text and headers.",
  "sinks": "Uses response headers to set attributes and determine rate-limiting status; no data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Response object is checked for status code and headers; if rate limited, information is stored in exception attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes, primarily for capturing rate-limiting info from API responses. The CartoRateLimitException class extracts rate limit details from response headers and provides a static method to check if a response is rate-limited. The implementation uses standard Python exception handling, relies on the requests library's response object, and performs no suspicious operations or data leaks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is focused on error handling for API rate limiting scenarios, which is normal for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes for API error handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
