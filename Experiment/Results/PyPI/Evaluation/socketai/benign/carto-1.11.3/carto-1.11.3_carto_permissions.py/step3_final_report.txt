{
  "purpose": "Defines internal data models for permissions and entities within the CARTO platform, serving as data structures without external interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyrestcli.resources, pyrestcli.fields, and local fields modules; constants for permission types.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data outputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions and constant assignments; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with standard fields and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions modeling permissions and entities with standard fields and constants. No external input handling, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The constants are simple string identifiers. The structure is typical for internal data modeling, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code. The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward analysis. No logical errors or security flaws are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of internal permission data models with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
