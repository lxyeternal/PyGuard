{
  "purpose": "Defines entity and permission classes for CARTO permissions management.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyrestcli.resources, pyrestcli.fields, and local .fields module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for internal data models. It uses standard field types and references external modules for resource and field definitions. No user input handling, no network operations, no eval or dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious logic. The constants defined are simple strings representing permission levels. The overall structure appears straightforward and consistent with typical data model code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious implementation of data classes for permissions management. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
