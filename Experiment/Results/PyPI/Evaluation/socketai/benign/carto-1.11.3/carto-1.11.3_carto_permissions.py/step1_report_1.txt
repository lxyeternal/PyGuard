{
  "purpose": "Define entity and permission data models for CARTO, a geospatial platform, with no direct API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imported modules 'pyrestcli.resources', 'pyrestcli.fields', and local '.fields'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points that handle untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly declares classes and fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple resource classes with fields for internal data modeling. It imports standard modules and custom fields, with no runtime input handling or external data processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data models for permissions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
