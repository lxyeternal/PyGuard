  "purpose": "Define entity and permission classes for the CARTO platform, including permission attributes and related metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for resources and fields, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. The constants PUBLIC, PRIVATE, LINK are standard permission types.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for permissions and entities, using standard Python class and attribute constructs. No external data input, no execution of untrusted code, and no dynamic code execution observed. The constants and class attributes are typical for modeling permission data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward definition of data models for permission management within CARTO. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks evident in this snippet.",
