  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the exposure of 'auth_token' in URLs, which is a common pattern but should be handled with care to prevent leaks. Overall, the code does not contain malware or obfuscation; the low risk score of 0.2 reflects this minor concern."
