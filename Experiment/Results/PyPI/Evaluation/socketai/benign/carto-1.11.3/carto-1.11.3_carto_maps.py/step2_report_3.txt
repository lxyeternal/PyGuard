  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs URLs for map tiles and API requests, with no malicious behavior. The main concern is the inclusion of `auth_token` in URLs, which could expose tokens if URLs are logged or intercepted.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n  - The `auth_token` is appended as a URL parameter, which is common but can be insecure if URLs are logged or captured.\n  - No malicious or backdoor code is present.\n  - The `send` method is external; if it transmits data insecurely, that’s outside this code's scope.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2, Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on URL construction, including `auth_token`. No malicious code, but potential token exposure.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n  - The use of URL parameters for tokens is standard but can be insecure.\n  - Exception handling is broad but not malicious.\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct reasoning; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard resource management with URL construction, token handling, and API calls. No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n  - Use of tokens in URLs is typical.\n  - No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n  - Exception handling is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent; scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on URL generation, API interaction, and token handling. No malicious code detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n  - Token appending in URLs is common but should be handled carefully.\n  - No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages map URLs and resources, with tokens included in URLs. No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n  - Use of tokens in URLs is standard but can be a security concern.\n  - No suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasoning is valid; scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, primarily due to token exposure in URLs, which is a common pattern but warrants cautious handling.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Note:** The main security concern is the exposure of `auth_token` in URLs, which is standard but should be managed securely in deployment environments. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---",
