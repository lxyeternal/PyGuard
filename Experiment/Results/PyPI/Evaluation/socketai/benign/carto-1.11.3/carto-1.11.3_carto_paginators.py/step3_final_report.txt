  "purpose": "Internal utility to retrieve paginated results from an API endpoint, managing URL generation and response processing.",
  "sources": "response.json() method to parse JSON data; initial_url parameter for starting point.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; standard JSON parsing and variable updates.",
  "flows": "response.json() -> total count checks -> page increment or URL termination.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward pagination logic with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical pagination pattern, checking for total counts in JSON responses and iterating through pages accordingly. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious actions. The logic is correct, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident. The response JSON is parsed safely, and the control flow is standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API pagination handler with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
