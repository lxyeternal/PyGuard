  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution, reading dependencies from external files with fallback defaults.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' files, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external code execution points.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from files (sources) with fallback defaults, then passing data to setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks without logging or error handling; no obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads dependencies with broad exception handling, which could mask errors but does not introduce security risks. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. The only minor concern is error masking, which does not elevate security risk. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
