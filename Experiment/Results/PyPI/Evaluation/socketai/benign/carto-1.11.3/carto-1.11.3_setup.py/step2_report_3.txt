  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' with fallback defaults.\n- Uses broad try-except blocks without logging.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The broad exception handling masks errors but does not introduce security risks or malicious activity.\n- No untrusted data sinks, code injection points, or external network interactions are present.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The use of broad `except:` blocks without logging or error handling could hide real issues (e.g., missing files or syntax errors). While this is a code quality concern, it is **not** a security risk or malicious.\n- No validation of dependency files, which could lead to silent failures or incorrect dependencies, but again, not malicious.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1; since no security vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The overall code is a standard setup script, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The minor use of broad exception handling does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n- No indication of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The slight differences in the security risk scores (mostly 0.1) are acceptable given the broad exception handling, but these are not indicative of actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.**",
