{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'carto', specifying dependencies and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Input from requirement files influences 'install_requires' and 'test_required', but no flow leads to execution of untrusted code or command injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except blocks may hide errors but not malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to set up a Python package, reading dependencies from external files with fallback defaults. The code is straightforward, standard for Python packaging, and contains no suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the broad except clauses which may suppress errors, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply manages dependencies and package metadata.",
