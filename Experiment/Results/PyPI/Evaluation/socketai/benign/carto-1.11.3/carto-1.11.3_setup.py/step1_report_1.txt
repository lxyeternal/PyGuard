  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'carto' Python SDK, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' files for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no code executes based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading dependency lists from files to pass to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except blocks that silently fallback; no validation of dependencies or malicious content. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No network activity or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency files to gather requirements, with fallback defaults. It then calls setuptools.setup() to package the project. There are no input validation issues, code injection points, or malicious behaviors. The broad exception handling could mask errors but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
