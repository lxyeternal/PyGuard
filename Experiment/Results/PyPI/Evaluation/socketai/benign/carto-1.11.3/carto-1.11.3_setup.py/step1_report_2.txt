  "purpose": "To set up the Python package 'carto' by reading dependency requirements and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' files for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input files (requirements) -> dependency list used in setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of broad exception handling which could mask errors, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency requirements from external files, falling back to default dependencies if files are missing. It then calls setuptools.setup() to package the project with provided metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no suspicious variable usage. No anomalies indicating malicious behavior. The code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
