{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'carto' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'test_requirements.txt' files to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from files, then passes them to setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling without logging or error reporting; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with fallback dependencies if files are missing. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The exception handling could be improved, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No external network connections, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs package configuration safely.",
