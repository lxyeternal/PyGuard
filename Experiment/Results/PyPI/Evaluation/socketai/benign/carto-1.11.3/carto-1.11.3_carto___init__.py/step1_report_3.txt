  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leakage points are apparent from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable, as the code is empty.",
  "anomalies": "The code block is empty, which is unusual. No code behavior or patterns are present that could indicate malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The submitted code contains no executable statements, imports, or logic. This absence of code makes it impossible to identify any source, sink, or flow. The empty code could be intentional or incomplete, but it does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior based on the available content.",
  "conclusion": "There is no actual code to analyze; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks are detectable. The code appears to be empty or placeholder.",
