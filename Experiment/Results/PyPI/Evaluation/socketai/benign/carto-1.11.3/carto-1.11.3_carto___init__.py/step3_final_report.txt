  "purpose": "The code appears to be either absent or minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It is likely a benign utility or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No input sources detected; no data read operations are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code itself; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is either empty or minimal, providing no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the limited information. Confidence levels vary but are justified by the lack of code content. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available data, the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects cautious baseline assessment due to incomplete information. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
