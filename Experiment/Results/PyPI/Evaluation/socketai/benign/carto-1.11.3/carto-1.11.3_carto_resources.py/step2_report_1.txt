  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; code extends resource classes with async handling and warnings; exception handling is broad but only re-raises errors; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard extension code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; adds warnings for non-public APIs; no suspicious behavior; exception handling is broad but harmless; no secrets or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK extension, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern; warnings for non-public APIs; send() method used for API requests; no signs of malicious activity; exception handling standard.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Adds async and warning features; send() used for external API interaction; no secrets or obfuscation; exception handling normal.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to others; extension with warnings; send() method for API calls; no suspicious code; standard exception handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads. The code is purely extension and warning wrappers around existing API classes.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code structure. No obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting the use of warnings and API interactions, but no real security threats.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is standard extension code, adding async capabilities and warnings for non-public APIs.  \n- The send() method is used for API communication, which is typical and not inherently risky, especially given the context.  \n- Exception handling is broad but only re-raises errors as a custom exception, which is acceptable.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads are present.  \n- Warnings are informational, not malicious.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the warnings and external API calls, which are standard in SDKs.\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very safe. No malicious or obfuscated elements are evident, and the risk is minimal.",
