  "purpose": "Extensions and custom resources for pyrestcli Resource and Manager classes, including warning mechanisms for non-public APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyrestcli.resources, methods within AsyncResource, WarnAsyncResource, WarnResource, and Manager classes.",
  "sinks": "send method in AsyncResource, exception handling, warnings issued during initialization, superclass constructor calls.",
  "flows": "send method called in run(), exception caught and re-raised as CartoException, warnings triggered during Warn* class instantiation, superclass init in Manager class.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of warnings to alert about non-public APIs, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends existing classes with added warnings and exception handling. The run method sends data via send(), catching exceptions to raise CartoException. Warnings are issued for non-public API classes. The Manager class initializes a paginator with attributes but does not process untrusted input or perform insecure operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an extension layer adding warnings and exception handling to existing API classes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The warnings are for informational purposes about non-public APIs. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
