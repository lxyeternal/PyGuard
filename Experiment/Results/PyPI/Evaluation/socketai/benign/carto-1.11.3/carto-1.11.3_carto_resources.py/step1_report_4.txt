  "purpose": "Extension of pyrestcli Resource and Manager classes for CARTO API interactions, providing async job handling and warnings for non-public APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports (pyrestcli.resources, warnings, custom exceptions), class initializations, method definitions (run, refresh, __init__), warnings.warn calls.",
  "sinks": "self.send method in run (potential for external API interaction), exception handling raising CartoException, warnings.warn (user notification), super() calls (resource management).",
  "flows": "run method: input client_params -> self.send -> potential API call; refresh method: get_resource_endpoint -> super.refresh(); warnings during class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn to alert users about non-public API, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code, exception handling with CartoException, no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of Resource and Manager intended to add async job support and warnings for non-public CARTO API endpoints. The run method performs an API POST request via self.send, and refresh updates resource state. Warnings are issued during class instantiation to alert users about non-public APIs. Exception handling wraps errors in CartoException. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard extension for API interaction with added user warnings. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as API client extension classes with warnings for non-public APIs. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly provides warnings and handles API interactions securely. The overall security risk is low.",
