  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's security implications, correctness, and consistency with the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends pyrestcli resource classes for async jobs and non-public API warnings. Uses broad exception handling, warnings for non-public APIs, no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The broad `except Exception` is a minor concern but common in such extension code.\n- No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The low risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension with warnings, no suspicious behavior, exception handling, and no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same as above; no malicious indicators.\n- Warnings are informational, not malicious.\n- Exception handling is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Adds async support and warnings; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends classes, adds warnings, performs API calls via `self.send`, exception handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The `run()` method's call to `self.send()` is standard for API clients.\n- Warnings are informational.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension with warnings, API calls, exception handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with other reports.\n- No malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. There's no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the low security risk of this extension code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to API interactions and warnings, but no real security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard extension code for an SDK, with proper warnings and exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
