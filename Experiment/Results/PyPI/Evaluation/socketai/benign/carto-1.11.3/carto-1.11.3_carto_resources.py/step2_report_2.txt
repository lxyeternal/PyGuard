  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends pyrestcli Resource and Manager for async jobs, adds warnings for non-public APIs.\n- **Code Elements:** Uses send() for API requests, broad exception handling, warnings.warn for non-public API classes.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Exception handling is broad but standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). Confidence high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard extension code with no malicious activity. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. The warning about non-public APIs is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension with warnings for non-public APIs, focus on resource management.\n- **Code Elements:** Uses send() in run(), warnings during class init, exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Warnings are informational.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators. Exception handling is standard. Warnings are for informational purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Adds async support and warnings for non-public APIs.\n- **Code Elements:** send() in run(), warnings in constructors, exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. No suspicious external activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends for async jobs, warnings, and resource management.\n- **Code Elements:** send() in run(), warnings during init, exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious indicators. The code is standard extension code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension with warnings about non-public APIs.\n- **Code Elements:** send() calls, warnings.warn, exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting that the code interacts with external APIs and issues warnings, but these are standard and low-risk activities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, primarily due to external API interactions and warnings, but no significant security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign extension of an SDK, adding async support and warnings for non-public APIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or high security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the risk score low (~0.1), maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and monitor for any future changes that might introduce vulnerabilities.",
