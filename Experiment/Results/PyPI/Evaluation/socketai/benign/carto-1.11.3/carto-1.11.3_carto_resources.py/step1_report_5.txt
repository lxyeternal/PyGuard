  "purpose": "Extensions for pyrestcli Resource and Manager classes to handle asynchronous operations and non-public APIs with warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports, class initializers, methods calling external APIs via self.send, warnings.warn, and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "self.send method (potential network call), warnings.warn (user notification), super() method calls, attribute access, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Method run() calls self.send to communicate with external server; __init__ methods set up attributes; refresh() accesses resource endpoints; warnings.warn notifies user; super() calls may invoke parent class methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn indicating non-public API; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; exception handling re-raises as CartoException.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes that extend existing resources and manage API interactions, adding warning notifications for non-public APIs. The run() method sends data to a remote server, which could be risky if misused, but there are no evident malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of warnings and exception handling appears standard. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly extension and warning wrappers for existing API resource classes. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior but includes warnings about non-public APIs. No security risks are evident beyond standard API interactions. Overall, the code appears safe with low likelihood of malicious intent.",
