  "purpose": "Extensions for pyrestcli Resource and Manager classes to add asynchronous job handling, warnings for non-public APIs, and manager initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class initializers, method definitions, warnings.warn calls, and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "send() method (likely makes HTTP requests), raise CartoException, warnings.warn.",
  "flows": "send() method uses parameters to make API requests; exception handling catches all exceptions and raises CartoException; warnings issued during class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except Exception as e' that can obscure specific errors; warnings warn about non-public APIs, but this is informational. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing resource and manager classes to add asynchronous job management and warnings for non-public APIs. The send() method is a key point where data is transmitted to external services. Exception handling is broad but only re-raises errors as CartoException. Warnings are properly issued for non-public API classes. No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard extension code with no suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard extension code for resource management with appropriate warnings and exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code fragment.",
