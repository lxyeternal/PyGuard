  "purpose": "Extensions and warnings for pyrestcli Resource and Manager classes, mainly to add asynchronous capabilities and non-public API warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pyrestcli.resources, local exceptions, and warnings module; class initializations; methods that send requests and raise exceptions; warnings issued in constructors.",
  "sinks": "send method in AsyncResource.run; exception raising in refresh; warnings in WarnAsyncResource and WarnResource constructors.",
  "flows": "Method calls in run lead to send; constructor warnings notify about non-public APIs; refresh method updates resource state; warnings and exception handling flow as intended.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings to indicate non-public API; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no suspicious external network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class extensions for resource management, adding asynchronous operation support and warnings for non-public APIs. The send method in run handles request dispatching but is standard and controlled. Warnings are used appropriately to flag non-public API usage. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity is present. Exception handling is standard, raising CartoException for errors. The code structure and flow are typical for SDK extensions and contain no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate SDK extension code, providing warnings and async capabilities without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security threats are identified based on this code segment.",
