  "purpose": "Test suite for encoding sentences and verifying embedding outputs, normalization, and input handling.",
  "sources": "Input sentences provided directly within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model.encode() calls; outputs are verified via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions invoking a SentenceTransformer model with various input formats, asserting output shapes, sums, and normalization. No external data, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries, and performs typical unit testing tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in one report is unjustified given the benign nature of the code, and should be adjusted to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for a sentence embedding model. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned are consistent with its behavior. The overall security risk should be considered negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the risk score at 0.",
