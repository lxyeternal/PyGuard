  "purpose": "Test suite for validating multi-process sentence embeddings using SentenceTransformer.",
  "sources": "Predefined sentences within the test; model methods for encoding and pooling.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or untrusted data handling; in-memory processing only.",
  "flows": "Input sentences -> model encoding -> embedding outputs; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pytest markers and skip decorator are standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite employing standard libraries (numpy, pytest, sentence_transformers). It performs in-memory validation of sentence embeddings, including normalization and consistency checks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign test script for embedding validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
