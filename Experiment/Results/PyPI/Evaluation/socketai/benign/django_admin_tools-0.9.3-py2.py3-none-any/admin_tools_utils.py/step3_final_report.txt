  "purpose": "Utility functions for Django admin, including URL generation, site retrieval, and model filtering, to support admin interface functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, accessing Django settings, importing modules dynamically based on configuration, and model metadata.",
  "sinks": "URL reversal functions that generate admin URLs based on model and site info.",
  "flows": "Input from request headers and settings flows into URL generation and module imports, influencing URL outputs and site selection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import_module based on configuration; deprecated attribute warnings; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django patterns for admin utilities, with dynamic imports for plugin/dashboard loading and URL reversal for navigation. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic import_module could pose a risk if settings are compromised, but in a controlled environment, this is typical. The URL generation relies on trusted model attributes and settings. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin utility module with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight security risk score of 0.2 reflects potential concerns if environment settings are compromised, but the code itself is safe and aligns with best practices.",
