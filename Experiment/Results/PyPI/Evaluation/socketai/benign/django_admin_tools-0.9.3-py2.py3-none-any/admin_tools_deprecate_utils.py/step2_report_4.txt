  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** Yes. The code matches the description.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified. The logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 seems high; since the code is benign, a risk score of 0.1 is more appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** No. No malicious or risky behavior is evident.\n- **Malware score?** 0, consistent.\n- **Assumptions?** None; the report correctly states benign behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same observations as Report 1. The code is benign, standard deprecation warning pattern.\n- **Risk score?** Should be lower than 0.5, e.g., 0.1.\n- **Malware?** 0, consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score?** Should be around 0.1.\n- **Malware?** 0, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; straightforward deprecation warning code.\n- **Risk score?** Should be lower, e.g., 0.1.\n- **Malware?** 0, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same benign pattern.\n- **Risk score?** Should be about 0.1.\n- **Malware?** 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk score:** Currently, most reports assign a risk of 0.5 or higher, which overstates the actual risk. The code is a standard utility pattern with no harmful behavior. A more appropriate risk score would be **around 0.1** for the potential of misuse or confusion, but not for malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust risk scores** to approximately **0.1** for all reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.**\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores estimate:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and standard usage patterns.",
