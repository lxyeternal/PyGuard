  "purpose": "Provide a utility for issuing deprecation warnings when an import path has changed.",
  "sources": "Input parameters old_name and new_name used to generate warning messages.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated during object instantiation, which could alert users about deprecated import paths.",
  "flows": "Calling import_path_is_changed with old_name and new_name returns a class that, upon instantiation, warns about deprecated usage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation present. Uses standard warnings mechanism. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a mixin class. When the mixin class is instantiated, it issues a deprecation warning informing users that a certain import path is deprecated. This is a typical pattern for deprecation handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The code relies solely on the warnings module and standard class creation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for deprecation warnings with no malicious intent. It correctly uses standard Python warnings and class creation. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
