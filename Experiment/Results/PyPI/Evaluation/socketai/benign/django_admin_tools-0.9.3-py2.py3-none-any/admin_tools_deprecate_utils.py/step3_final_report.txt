  "purpose": "Provides a utility to issue deprecation warnings when import paths change, by creating a mixin class that warns upon instantiation.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'old_name' and 'new_name' used in the warning message during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn invoked during __new__, which outputs a DeprecationWarning.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the returned class triggers warnings with messages referencing 'old_name' and 'new_name'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward use of warnings in class creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function returning a mixin class that issues a deprecation warning when instantiated. It uses standard Python practices, with no external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The warning message is constructed from parameters, but these are typical inputs. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The pattern is common for deprecation notices, and the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deprecation warnings with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
