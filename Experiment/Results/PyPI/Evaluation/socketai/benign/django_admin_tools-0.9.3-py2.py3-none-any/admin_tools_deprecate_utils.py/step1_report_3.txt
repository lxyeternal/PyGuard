{
  "purpose": "This module provides a utility function to warn users about deprecated import paths, facilitating migration to new module names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'old_name' and 'new_name', and uses the class constructor to generate warnings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('old_name', 'new_name') are used to generate warning messages during class instantiation, which are then issued as warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates a class that issues a warning upon instantiation, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a class. When an instance of this class is created, it emits a deprecation warning informing the user of a changed import path. The warning message is dynamically generated but straightforward. No external data is fetched, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The structure is simple and standard for deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a benign purpose of notifying users about deprecated module names.",
