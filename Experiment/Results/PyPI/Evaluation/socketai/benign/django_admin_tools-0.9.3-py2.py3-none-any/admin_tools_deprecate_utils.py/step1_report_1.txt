{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for issuing deprecation warnings when importing changed module paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads the parameters 'old_name' and 'new_name' when calling 'import_path_is_changed'. It also involves class instantiation within '__new__' and the use of the 'warnings.warn' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'warnings.warn' function issues a deprecation warning, which is generally safe but can potentially be misused to generate misleading warnings or leak information if message contents are manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('old_name', 'new_name') flow into the message construction inside '__new__'. When a class created via 'import_path_is_changed' is instantiated, the warning is issued with a message referencing the deprecation. No external untrusted data flows directly into a sink that could cause harm, but the warning message is generated dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and uses standard Python warnings for deprecation. No suspicious or unusual code structures, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a mixin class designed to issue a deprecation warning when instantiated. It uses standard Python patterns and the 'warnings' module, with no signs of malicious behavior. The message references old and new names, which is typical for deprecation notices. There are no suspicious data flows or obfuscated techniques. Overall, it is a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard practices without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
