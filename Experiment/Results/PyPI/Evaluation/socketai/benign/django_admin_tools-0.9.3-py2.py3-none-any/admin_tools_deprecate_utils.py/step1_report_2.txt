{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility to warn about deprecated import paths by creating a mixin class that issues warnings when instantiated.",
  "sources": "The function import_path_is_changed which takes old_name and new_name as parameters and defines a class that issues a warning upon instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The warning.warn call within the __new__ method, which issues a DeprecationWarning when the class is instantiated.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the class returned by import_path_is_changed leads to warning issuance via warnings.warn.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard warning mechanisms for deprecation notices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a mixin class. When this class is instantiated, it issues a deprecation warning indicating that an import path has changed. The warning uses the class type, old_name, and new_name to inform users. There are no external data sources, no network activity, or suspicious code behaviors. The logic is straightforward and intended for deprecation handling without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deprecation warnings with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply issues a warning when a deprecated import is used. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
