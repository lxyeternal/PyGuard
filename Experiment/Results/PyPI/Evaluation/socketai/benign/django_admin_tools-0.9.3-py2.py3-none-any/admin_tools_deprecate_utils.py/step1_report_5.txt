{
  "purpose": "This module provides a utility function to warn users when an import path has changed, encouraging migration to the new module name.",
  "sources": "The function import_path_is_changed takes old_name and new_name as input parameters.",
  "targets": "The code generates a DeprecationWarning message for users when the returned class is instantiated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters old_name and new_name are used within the warning message generated during class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard practices for deprecation warnings. The use of warnings.warn within __new__ is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a mixin class. When this class is instantiated, it issues a deprecation warning informing users about the old import path and suggesting the new one. The warning is issued using warnings.warn at the point of object creation, which is acceptable. The code does not contain any malicious activity such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. It performs a benign deprecation warning mechanism. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard deprecation warning pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for guiding users to updated import paths.",
