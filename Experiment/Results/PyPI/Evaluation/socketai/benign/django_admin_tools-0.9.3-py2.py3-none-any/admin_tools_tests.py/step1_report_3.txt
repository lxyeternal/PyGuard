  "purpose": "Unit testing code to verify deprecation warnings for specific classes and modules in the admin_tools package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and function definitions, import of specific modules and classes within test methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking for DeprecationWarning and the presence of 'deprecated' in warning messages.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class instantiations trigger warnings, which are caught and evaluated in assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of unittests to check for deprecation warnings on specific classes and modules within the admin_tools package. It uses standard warnings catch mechanisms to assert whether certain classes are deprecated or not. The tests involve importing modules, instantiating classes, and verifying warning messages. No external data input, network activity, or harmful behavior is present. The code appears to be straightforward testing logic with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests aimed at verifying deprecation warnings within a specific package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure and logic are standard for testing deprecation warnings.",
