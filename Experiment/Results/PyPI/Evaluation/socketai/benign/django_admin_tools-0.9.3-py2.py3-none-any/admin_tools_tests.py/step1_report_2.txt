{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for checking deprecation warnings in the admin_tools package modules.",
  "sources": "import statements, attribute checks, module imports within test methods",
  "sinks": "assert statements checking warnings, module imports",
  "flows": "import modules -> create objects or call functions -> warnings captured and assertions made",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; no network or system manipulation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test class designed to verify deprecation warnings for various modules and classes within the admin_tools package. It uses warnings.catch_warnings to monitor deprecation warnings emitted when instantiating classes. The code imports modules dynamically within test methods, which is standard practice in test suites. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code’s structure and logic are clear and consistent with typical testing code, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing script for deprecation warnings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
