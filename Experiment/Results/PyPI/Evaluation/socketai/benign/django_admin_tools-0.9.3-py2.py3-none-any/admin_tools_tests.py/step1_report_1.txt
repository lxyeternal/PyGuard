  "purpose": "Unit testing for deprecated warnings in admin_tools.dashboard and admin_tools.menu modules",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__ import, warnings, unittest), class and method definitions, import within methods for models, dashboards, modules, menu, items",
  "sinks": "Warnings handling (warnings.catch_warnings, warnings.simplefilter), object instantiations (cls(*args, **kwargs))",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Instantiate classes -> Capture warnings -> Assert warning presence or absence",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings testing; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no file manipulations or external system interactions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unittest.TestCase subclass for testing deprecation warnings of various classes in the admin_tools package. It uses warnings.catch_warnings to verify whether certain classes trigger DeprecationWarning upon instantiation, and whether others do not. The import statements are straightforward, and class/method structures are typical for test cases. No user input, external data sources, or dangerous operations are present. There is no obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is solely to validate deprecation warnings, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for deprecation warnings with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It employs standard testing and warnings handling practices. There are no signs of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
