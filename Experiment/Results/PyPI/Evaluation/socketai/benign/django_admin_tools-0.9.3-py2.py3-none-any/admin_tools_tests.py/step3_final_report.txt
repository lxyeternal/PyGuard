  "purpose": "Unit testing for deprecation warnings in admin_tools.dashboard and admin_tools.menu modules.",
  "sources": "Class instantiations within test methods, warnings.catch_warnings context managers.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of classes that may trigger warnings; no external data or network calls.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation within warnings.catch_warnings blocks, leading to warning capture and assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or external interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python unit testing practices to verify deprecation warnings, using warnings.catch_warnings and assertions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with no external data handling or network activity. The purpose is solely to verify warnings, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for deprecation warnings with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All observed signals are consistent with safe, intended testing behavior.",
