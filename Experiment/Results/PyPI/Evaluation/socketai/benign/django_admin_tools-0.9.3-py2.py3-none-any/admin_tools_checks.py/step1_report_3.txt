  "purpose": "The code defines a Django check for verifying the configuration of the 'admin_tools' package, specifically ensuring a template loader is included and the 'admin:admin/base.html' template exists.",
  "sources": "The code reads the template 'admin:admin/base.html' using get_template()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "Code attempts to load a specific template; if it fails, it registers a warning",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, and no obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Django check module that registers a configuration verification function. It attempts to load a template to verify correct setup. The get_template call is safe and does not involve untrusted data, nor does it execute malicious code. The warning message is informational and refers to documentation. No potential attack vectors, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident from this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django check for configuration correctness. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. The purpose is purely to provide user guidance; there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
