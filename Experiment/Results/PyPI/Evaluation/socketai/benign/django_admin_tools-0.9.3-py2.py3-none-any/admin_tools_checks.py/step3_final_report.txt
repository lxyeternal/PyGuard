  "purpose": "The code performs a Django system check to verify the existence of the 'admin:admin/base.html' template, issuing a warning if missing to guide configuration.",
  "sources": "The call to get_template('admin:admin/base.html') and the exception handling for TemplateDoesNotExist.",
  "sinks": "The appending of the warning W001 to the result list when the template is missing.",
  "flows": "Source: get_template() reading the template; Sink: appending warning to results if exception occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django configuration check that attempts to load a specific admin template. If the template does not exist, it issues a warning to guide the user to add the appropriate loader. It uses safe, standard Django API functions and exception handling. No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution occurs. The logic is simple and clear, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django configuration check with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is warranted.",
