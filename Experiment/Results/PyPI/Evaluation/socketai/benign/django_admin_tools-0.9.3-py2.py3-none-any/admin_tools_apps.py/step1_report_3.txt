  "purpose": "Configure the Django app 'admin_tools' and load custom checks during app initialization.",
  "sources": "The 'ready' method imports the 'checks' module from the same package.",
  "sinks": "The import statement is a safe operation; no data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves the import of 'checks' during app startup, which triggers loading of additional code, but no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AppConfig subclass for Django, setting default auto field and app name. The 'ready' method imports a 'checks' module, which is typical for registering custom Django system checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious operations. The import is standard and does not involve dynamic execution or external data sources. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration file that loads custom checks during startup. There are no indications of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in this snippet.",
