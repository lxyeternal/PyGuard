{
  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class for 'admin_tools' that loads checks when the app is ready.",
  "sources": "The class definition, the 'ready' method, and the import statement within 'ready'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement within the 'ready' method could potentially load code at runtime, but it is a standard Django pattern.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method calls super().ready() and then imports the 'checks' module, which executes at app startup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and follows standard Django practices; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a 'ready' method that loads a 'checks' module upon application startup. The import within 'ready' is typical for registering custom checks or signals. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration module that loads custom checks during app initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
