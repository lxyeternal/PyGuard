{
  "purpose": "Define Django application configuration for 'admin_tools', including setup procedures during application startup.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'checks' module within the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method calls the superclass's 'ready' and then imports a module, which executes code at startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports are present. Importing 'checks' is typical for Django apps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass, specifying default auto field and app name. The 'ready' method loads a module named 'checks'. This is standard practice for registering system checks in Django applications. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. The import occurs during app initialization, which is typical for loading custom checks or configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads a module during startup, which is common practice. No malware or security issues detected.",
