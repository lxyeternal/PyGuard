{
  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class for 'admin_tools' that loads checks on startup.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'checks' module within the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "The 'ready' method calls 'super().ready()' and then imports the 'checks' module, which is standard for Django app configs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass, specifying default_auto_field and name. The 'ready' method properly calls the superclass method and then imports a local 'checks' module, which is typical for loading application checks during startup. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. The import within 'ready' is standard for modular check registration and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django application configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely loads application checks during startup, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
