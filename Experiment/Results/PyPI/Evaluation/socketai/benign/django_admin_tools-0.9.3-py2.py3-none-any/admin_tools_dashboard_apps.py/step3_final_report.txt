All indicators point to a benign, static configuration module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with typical Django patterns and contains no secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django app configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
