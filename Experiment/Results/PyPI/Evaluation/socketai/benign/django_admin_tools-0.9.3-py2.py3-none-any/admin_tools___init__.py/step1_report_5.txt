  "purpose": "Provide description and configuration setup for the django-admin-tools package, including version info and conditional app configuration.",
  "sources": "VERSION variable assignment, import statement for django, conditional block checking django.VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statement and version check flow without data flow to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward, standard for a package's __init__.py",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, attempts to import Django, and conditionally sets a default app config for Django versions below 3.2. If Django is not installed, it silently ignores the import error. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The code follows typical patterns for package configuration in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs version checking and configuration setup in a standard manner.",
