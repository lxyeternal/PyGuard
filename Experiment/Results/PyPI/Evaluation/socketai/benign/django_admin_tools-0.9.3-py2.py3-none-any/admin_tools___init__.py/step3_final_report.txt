  "purpose": "This code initializes configuration for the django-admin-tools package, setting version info and adjusting app configuration based on Django version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statement for django, version tuple, assignment to default_app_config",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Import and version check flow to conditional assignment of default_app_config",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and version check; silent handling of ImportError",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup snippet for a Django package, defining a version string, attempting to import Django, and conditionally setting default_app_config based on Django version. It handles ImportError gracefully, which is common for optional dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input, external data, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is standard for maintaining compatibility across Django versions. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration snippet for a Django package, with no malicious or security concerns. The analysis confirms that the code poses no threat, and the scores are appropriate.",
