{
  "purpose": "To provide descriptive information and configuration setup for the django-admin-tools package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version, attempts to import django, and checks django.VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to vulnerable operations or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading version info and conditionally setting a configuration variable based on the imported django version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard version checking and conditional configuration assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, containing package description, version declaration, and a version check for django. It conditionally sets 'default_app_config' if django is imported and its version is below 3.2. This is typical for Django apps needing compatibility configuration. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign configuration/setup script for the django-admin-tools package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
