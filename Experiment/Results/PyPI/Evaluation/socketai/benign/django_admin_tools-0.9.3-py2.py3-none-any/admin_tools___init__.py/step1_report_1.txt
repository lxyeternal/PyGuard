  "purpose": "Defines metadata and configuration for the django-admin-tools package, including version info and conditional app configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'django' module; the 'VERSION' variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import and version check are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package metadata and includes a version check to conditionally set 'default_app_config' based on Django version. No dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The import check and version comparison are standard patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves to configure the Django application properly depending on the Django version. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
