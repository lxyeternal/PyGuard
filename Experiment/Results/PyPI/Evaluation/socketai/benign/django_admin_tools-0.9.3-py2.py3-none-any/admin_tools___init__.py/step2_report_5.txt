  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code snippet to assess potential security concerns.\n\n1. **Code Review and Data Flow Analysis:**\n   - The code imports the `django` module and assigns a version string.\n   - It performs a version check (`django.VERSION < (3, 2)`) to conditionally set `default_app_config`.\n   - The `try-except` block handles the case where `django` isn't installed, avoiding runtime errors.\n   - There are no dynamic data inputs, no user inputs, and no external data sources.\n   - The code does not execute any untrusted data, nor does it write or transmit data externally.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The logic is straightforward and standard for Django app configuration.\n   - The version check is a common pattern to maintain compatibility with different Django versions.\n   - No flaws or mistakes in reasoning are evident; the code aligns with typical Django app setup practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code execution is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear and readable; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — The code does not introduce any security risks; it’s standard configuration code.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they simply describe configuration code.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities are suggested or implied.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports uniformly assess the code as benign, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The scores given (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all zero, which is appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup snippet for a Django package.\n- No security issues, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The reported analysis and scores are consistent and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
