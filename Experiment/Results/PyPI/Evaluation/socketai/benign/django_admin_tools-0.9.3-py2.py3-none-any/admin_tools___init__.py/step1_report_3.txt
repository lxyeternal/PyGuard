{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration setup for the django-admin-tools package, including version info and conditional app configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement for django module; VERSION variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import and version info are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata and conditionally sets a configuration variable based on the Django version. The import of django is standard, and the version check is straightforward. There are no suspicious operations such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or malicious network activity. The try-except block for import errors is typical for optional dependencies or version-dependent configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign part of a Python package setup, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply configures package behavior based on Django version.",
