  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward package initialization snippet.\n   - It defines a version string.\n   - It attempts to import Django.\n   - If Django is imported successfully and its version is less than 3.2, it sets `default_app_config`.\n   - It handles ImportError gracefully.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, no external data sources, no obfuscated code, and no hardcoded secrets.\n   - The logic is standard for Django package compatibility setup.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O beyond import, or data handling.\n   - No malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The import and version check are static and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is benign setup/configuration code.\n\n4. **Any discrepancies or unusual claims?**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound.\n\n5. **Additional considerations:**\n   - The code's purpose is purely configuration; it does not handle or process untrusted data.\n   - The version check is standard for maintaining compatibility.\n   - The try-except block for import errors is typical and not suspicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign Django package setup snippet.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
