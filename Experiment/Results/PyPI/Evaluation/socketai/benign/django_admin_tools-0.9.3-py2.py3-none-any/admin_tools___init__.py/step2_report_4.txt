  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard setup snippet for a Django package.\n   - The code defines a version string, attempts to import Django, and conditionally sets `default_app_config` based on the Django version.\n   - No dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or data flows from untrusted sources are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Assumptions**:\n   - The code is straightforward package configuration; no assumptions about malicious activity are justified.\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities beyond standard version compatibility setup.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification**:\nThe code is a standard, benign package setup snippet. It performs version checking and configuration without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- No security concerns or malware risks are present.\n- Scores are justified as they are.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
