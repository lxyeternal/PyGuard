  "purpose": "Provide descriptions and configuration setup for the django-admin-tools package",
  "sources": "Import statement for django module, version assignment, and conditional assignment of default_app_config",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external data sources are used",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for a Django package setup",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a package description, version, and conditionally sets a Django app configuration based on the Django version. It imports django, handles ImportError, and sets default_app_config if the Django version is less than 3.2. All operations are standard and do not involve any malicious behavior, data leakage, or unusual activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external communication observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to configure a Django app depending on the environment. Overall, it appears safe.",
