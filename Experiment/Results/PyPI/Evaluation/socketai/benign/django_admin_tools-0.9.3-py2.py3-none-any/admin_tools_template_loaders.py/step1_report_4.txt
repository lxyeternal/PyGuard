  "purpose": "Custom Django template loader to load templates from specific apps, enabling template extension and override.",
  "sources": "App configs via django.apps.apps.get_app_configs(), template_name input in get_template_sources(), join() function for path construction.",
  "sinks": "join() function for path construction, return statements providing file paths or origins.",
  "flows": "Input: template_name (potentially from user) -> get_template_sources() -> get_app_template_dir() -> join() -> return origin or path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of join() on potentially untrusted input (template_name) split by colon, but only in a controlled manner; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django template loader, primarily retrieving app-specific template directories and constructing file paths. It uses app configs to locate template directories, caches results for efficiency, and constructs Origin objects for template source referencing. The path construction is based on trusted app directory info, and the template_name input is split by colon, assuming correct formatting. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. No external network or system modification actions are performed. The use of join() is standard for path handling, and the code relies on Django's internal app configuration APIs without executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Django template loader extension with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose, with proper caching and path handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
