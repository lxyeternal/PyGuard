{
  "purpose": "The code extends Django's template loading system to load templates from specific application directories, allowing overriding and extending templates in a modular way.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'template_name' and accesses application configuration data via django.apps and the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return of the get_template_sources method, which provides file paths or origins for template files based on input 'template_name'.",
  "flows": "Input 'template_name' containing an app label and template filename flows into get_template_sources, which splits and processes it to generate file paths or Origin objects for template loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No network operations or code injection points detected. Usage of standard Django APIs and filesystem operations, which are typical for template loaders.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves application template directories via Django's apps API, caches these paths, and constructs template origins using Django's Origin class. It checks for a colon in the template name to parse app label and filename, preventing arbitrary path injections. The use of try-except around Origin creation is standard and does not involve untrusted code execution. No malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are present; the code performs expected template loading functions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard extension of Django's template loader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages path retrieval and template origin creation without executing untrusted data or exposing security vulnerabilities.",
