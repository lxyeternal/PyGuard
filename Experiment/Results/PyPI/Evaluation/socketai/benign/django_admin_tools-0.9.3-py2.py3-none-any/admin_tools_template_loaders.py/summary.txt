  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django template loader extension with a minor security concern regarding unvalidated 'template_name' input that could lead to directory traversal. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). To improve security, input validation should be added to prevent directory traversal, but as it stands, the code is safe for typical use."
