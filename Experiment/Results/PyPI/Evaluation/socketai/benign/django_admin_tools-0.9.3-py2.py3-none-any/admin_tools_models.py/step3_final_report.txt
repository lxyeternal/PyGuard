{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring scores and conclusions are consistent with the analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network communication functions, data processing routines",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, system commands, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file system operations",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious patterns, suspicious behaviors, and anomalies. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities was found. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk=0.2 are justified given the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and low or zero where code is absent. The reasoning is consistent across all reports, aligning with the provided descriptions and scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or suspicious indicators. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
