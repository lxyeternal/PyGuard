  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but without the actual code, the specific intent cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from user, environment variables, files, or network data streams. Exact sources cannot be identified without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess execution, or data transmission points. Specific sinks are not identifiable without the code.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from sources to sinks could involve data transformations or checks, but without code, these paths cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to lack of code. Typically, anomalies include hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow, none of which can be confirmed here.",
  "analysis": "In the absence of provided code, no step-by-step analysis is possible. Typically, such analysis involves identifying input points, data handling, and output points, along with checking for suspicious patterns or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "There is insufficient information to determine if the code contains malicious behavior or security risks. Without the actual code, no definitive conclusions can be made.",
