  "purpose": "Configure URL routing in a Django project, including optional admin tools modules based on settings.",
  "sources": "Reading Django version, settings.INSTALLED_APPS, and defining urlpatterns.",
  "targets": "Potentially influence URL routing behavior; no direct data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input: Django version and settings; Output: urlpatterns list, modified based on installed apps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution; straightforward URL configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adjusts URL patterns based on Django version and installed applications, specifically for admin tools modules. It conditionally includes URL patterns for 'admin_tools.menu' and 'admin_tools.dashboard' if they are present in INSTALLED_APPS. The logic is standard Django URL configuration with version compatibility handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for a Django project setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django URL configuration snippet with conditional inclusion based on installed apps. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
