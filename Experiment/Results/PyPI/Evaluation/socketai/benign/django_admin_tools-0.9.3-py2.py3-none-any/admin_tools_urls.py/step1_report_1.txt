  "purpose": "The code sets up URL routing for a Django application, conditionally importing modules based on Django version and including admin tools URLs if present.",
  "sources": "Reading Django version, reading settings.INSTALLED_APPS, importing modules, accessing urlpatterns list",
  "sinks": "Appending URL patterns to urlpatterns based on installed apps",
  "flows": "Django version check -> Conditional import -> Checking installed apps -> Appending URL patterns",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. The use of version-dependent imports is standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Django setup tasks: importing modules based on Django version, checking installed apps, and configuring URL patterns accordingly. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL configuration snippet with conditional imports and optional app inclusion. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
