  "purpose": "Django URL configuration setup for different versions and optional admin tools modules inclusion based on installed apps.",
  "sources": "Django settings.INSTALLED_APPS, import statements, URL pattern definitions",
  "sinks": "URL patterns that include admin_tools modules, which could potentially route to malicious code if compromised",
  "flows": "Checks for installed apps lead to app-specific URL inclusion, but no untrusted input flows are evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of version-based imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles importing URL functions based on Django version, then conditionally appends URL patterns for admin_tools modules if present in settings.INSTALLED_APPS. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The URL inclusion is standard Django practice; no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL configuration snippet with conditional imports and optional URL pattern additions. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are evident. It appears safe and standard.",
