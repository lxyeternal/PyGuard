  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for Django project based on version and installed apps.",
  "sources": "Django settings.INSTALLED_APPS and version information, URL patterns defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern registration and inclusion of app URLs, potential exposure of route configurations.",
  "flows": "Based on installed apps, URL patterns are appended, using imported URL functions for route inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-dependent import statements; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports URL functions depending on Django version, then conditionally adds URL patterns for admin tools if they are installed. No untrusted input is used; the URL patterns are static and based on configuration. The code is standard for Django URL configuration and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. No data leaks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward Django URL configuration that dynamically handles different Django versions and includes admin tool URLs if present. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
