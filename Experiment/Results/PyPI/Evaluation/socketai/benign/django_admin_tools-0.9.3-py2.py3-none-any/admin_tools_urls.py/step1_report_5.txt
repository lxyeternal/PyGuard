  "purpose": "Configure URL patterns for a Django project based on version and installed apps.",
  "sources": "Django settings (settings.INSTALLED_APPS), Django version (django.VERSION).",
  "sinks": "URL pattern list 'urlpatterns' which is used by Django routing.",
  "flows": "Imports depend on Django version, and the conditional app inclusion adds URL patterns based on installed apps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard Django URL configuration logic with conditional imports and app URL inclusion.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports URL functions depending on Django version, then constructs URL patterns based on the presence of 'admin_tools' modules in installed apps. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The code simply manages URL routing in a standard way without any external data inputs or suspicious flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Django URL configuration script with conditional imports and optional app URL inclusion. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior detected. The code appears safe and standard for Django projects.",
