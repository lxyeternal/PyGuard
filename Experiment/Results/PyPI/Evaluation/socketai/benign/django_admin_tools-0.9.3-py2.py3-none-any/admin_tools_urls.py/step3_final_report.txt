  "purpose": "Standard Django URL configuration with version-dependent imports and conditional inclusion of admin tools URLs based on installed apps.",
  "sources": "Reads Django version, checks settings.INSTALLED_APPS, imports URL functions, and appends URL patterns conditionally.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version and settings -> conditionally appends URL patterns based on installed apps -> no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard practice, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check to import URL functions appropriately and conditionally adds URL patterns if certain admin tools are installed. It does not process untrusted input, execute network operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code. The logic is clear, and the structure aligns with common Django practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor security risk scores (0.1) in some reports reflect minimal exposure due to URL pattern inclusion but are justified as the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django URL configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, as there is no real security concern.",
