  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard URL setup based on Django version and optional admin tools.\n- Sources & sinks: Reading version, settings, appending URL patterns.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis & conclusion: No malicious behavior, straightforward code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practice.\n- Slightly less confident (1 vs. 1), but still consistent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- Notes: URL inclusion based on installed apps, no untrusted input.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — minor, perhaps considering minimal exposure.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment, standard Django URL config.\n- Confidence=1.0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, standard practice.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard Django URL configuration.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The use of version-dependent imports and conditional URL inclusion is normal practice.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero in some reports (0.1). Given the code's nature, these should be adjusted to 0, as there's no real security concern.\n- The malware score is correctly at 0; no change needed.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe Django URL configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
