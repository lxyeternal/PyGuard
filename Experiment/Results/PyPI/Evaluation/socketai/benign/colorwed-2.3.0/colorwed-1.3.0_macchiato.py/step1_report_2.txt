{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to read Python source code, wrap it with synthetic code for parsing, format it with 'black', and then unwrap and output the formatted code.",
  "sources": "Input is read from sys.stdin (standard input) as lines of code.",
  "sinks": "The formatted lines are written to sys.stdout (standard output). The code executes 'black.main' with a temporary filename, which involves external process invocation and temporary file handling.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> wrap_lines() (adding fake code) -> format_lines() (calling black) -> unwrap_lines() (removing fake code) -> output lines",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'black.main' with arguments; creation and handling of temporary files; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code patterns; minimal unusual code beyond standard formatting process.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs input reading, temporary file handling, and calls the 'black' formatter to reformat Python code. It injects synthetic code (fake lines) to ensure syntactic correctness during formatting and then removes these additions. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious data handling is present. The use of 'tokenize' to analyze indentation and handle specific code structures appears legitimate. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The code's purpose aligns with automated code formatting, and the external 'black' dependency is standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate code formatter wrapper that uses 'black' to reformat Python source code, adding and removing synthetic code as needed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage within this code. It appears safe and consistent with its stated purpose.",
