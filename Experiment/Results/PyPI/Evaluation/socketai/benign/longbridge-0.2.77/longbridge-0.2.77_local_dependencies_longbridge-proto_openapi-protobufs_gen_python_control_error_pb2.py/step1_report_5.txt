  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for error messages in a control system.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf libraries, serialized file data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to outputs or sinks; code is primarily defining descriptors.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code includes no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, no dynamic execution, and no network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated by the protocol buffer compiler, including standard library imports and descriptor setup. It defines message structures for error reporting using protobuf. No malicious behaviors, such as network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code, are present. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate protobuf definition, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard generated protobuf code for error messages, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code does not perform any suspicious actions and is typical for serialization schema definitions.",
