{
  "purpose": "This code defines protobuf message schemas for trade subscription, responses, notifications, and commands, generated by the protobuf compiler for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads embedded serialized descriptor data for message definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data sinks or external data processing points; the code only defines message schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flows at runtime; the code is static schema definition without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward generated protobuf schema.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated protobuf schema file with no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations. It imports standard protobuf modules and loads a serialized descriptor, which is typical for such generated code. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, schema-only nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. The code does not process untrusted data directly and contains no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This protobuf generated code is safe, static, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
