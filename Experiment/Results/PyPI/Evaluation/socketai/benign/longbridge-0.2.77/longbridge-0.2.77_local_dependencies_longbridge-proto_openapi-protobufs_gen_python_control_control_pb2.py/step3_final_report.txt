  "purpose": "This code is auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for control messages, with no executable logic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Descriptor data and message schema definitions within the protobuf generated code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines message structures.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only loads descriptors and defines message classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard protobuf generated boilerplate with serialized descriptor data.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely auto-generated protobuf schema definitions, containing no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. It does not include hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The descriptor data is typical for protobuf files. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is 0, since the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the standard, well-understood nature of protobuf generated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated protobuf schema definitions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and analysis are justified and should remain as is.",
