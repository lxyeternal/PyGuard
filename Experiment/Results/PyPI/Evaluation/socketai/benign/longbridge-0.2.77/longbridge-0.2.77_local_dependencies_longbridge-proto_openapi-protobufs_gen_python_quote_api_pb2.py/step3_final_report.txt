  "purpose": "Auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for a financial trading API, serving as data serialization structures.",
  "sources": "Embedded serialized protobuf descriptor data within the code, used for message definitions.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, external data handling, or network operations; purely static schema definitions.",
  "flows": "Serialization and deserialization of protobuf messages based on the schema; no dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard generated protobuf code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protobuf message and enum definitions generated by the protobuf compiler. It contains no executable logic, no network calls, no data handling of untrusted input, and no obfuscation. The embedded serialized descriptor data is typical for protobuf generated files. All signals indicate a benign, static schema file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated protobuf schema definition with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high risk and malware scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; the appropriate assessment is that it poses no security threat.",
