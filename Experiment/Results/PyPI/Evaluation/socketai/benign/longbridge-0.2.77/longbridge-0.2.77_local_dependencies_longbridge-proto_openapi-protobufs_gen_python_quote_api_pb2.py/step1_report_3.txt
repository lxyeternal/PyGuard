{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for longbridgeapp.quote.v1 API definitions and message serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.protobuf library; serialized descriptor data embedded as bytes.",
  "sinks": "None; no code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond data definition and serialization.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; this is static code generated for data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of serialized descriptor data within the source code; typical for generated code, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments identified. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated by the protobuf compiler, containing descriptors and message definitions for the API. It imports standard protobuf modules and builds descriptors for message types. The serialized descriptor data is a common pattern in protobuf-generated code. No logic, input handling, or network activity is present; the code solely defines data structures for serialization/deserialization. No anomalies, secrets, or malicious behavior patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard generated protobuf code used for serializing/deserializing data in the longbridgeapp.quote.v1 API. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present. The code's purpose is data structure definition, with no active runtime components that could be exploited.",
