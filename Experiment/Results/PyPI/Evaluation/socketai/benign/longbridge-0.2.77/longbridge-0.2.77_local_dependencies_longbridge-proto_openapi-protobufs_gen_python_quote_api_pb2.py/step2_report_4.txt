  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely auto-generated protobuf schema definitions, with embedded serialized descriptor data.\n- No executable logic, network calls, file operations, or runtime data processing are present.\n- The code serves solely for data serialization/deserialization.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- The serialized descriptor data is standard in protobuf generated files.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—auto-generated protobuf definitions with no executable or malicious components.\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate zero malware risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** No active security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are present in the analysis; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign, auto-generated, and schema-only.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n### Score evaluation:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is standard protobuf schema definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that embedded serialized protobuf data is normal for generated code.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious payloads are made; the analysis is based on code content and structure.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely auto-generated, schema-defining protobuf code with no malicious or risky components.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed. The code is safe, benign, and typical for protobuf-generated API schema files.",
