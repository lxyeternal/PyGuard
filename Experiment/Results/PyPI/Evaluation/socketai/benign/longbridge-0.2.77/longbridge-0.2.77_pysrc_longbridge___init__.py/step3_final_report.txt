{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module, reassigns it in sys.modules, and defines a custom exception class, attaching it to the module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'sys' and 'longbridge.openapi'; reading the 'openapi' module; defining the 'OpenApiException' class.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules['longbridge.openapi']; setting 'openapi.OpenApiException' to the custom exception class.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'longbridge.openapi', assigns it to sys.modules, then defines and attaches a custom exception class to the module.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual reassignment of sys.modules entry for 'longbridge.openapi', which is common in testing or patching but atypical in standard code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module import, monkey patching, and exception class definition. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The reassignment of sys.modules is unconventional but not malicious, often used in testing or mocking scenarios. The custom exception class is straightforward and does not process external input. The code is simple, clear, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard setup tasks with an unusual but harmless module reassignment. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. The scores should reflect a safe, straightforward code snippet.",
