  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class and modify a module import for API handling.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module, importing openapi from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicating potential vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "Reassigning sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'] to openapi could affect module behavior, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a relative 'longbridge.openapi'. It then replaces an entry in sys.modules with openapi, possibly to override or mock the module. It also defines an exception class, OpenApiException, and assigns it to openapi.OpenApiException, modifying the openapi module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The reassignment might be unusual but is not inherently malicious; it could be for testing or customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily modifies module references and defines an exception class without any suspicious or malicious activities. No security risks are evident based solely on this code snippet.",
