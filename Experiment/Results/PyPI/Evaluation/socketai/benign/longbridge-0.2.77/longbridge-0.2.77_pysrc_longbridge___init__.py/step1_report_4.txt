{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for OpenApi errors and assign an imported module to a specific sys.modules entry.",
  "sources": "The imported module 'longbridge.openapi'. No external data input or user data read.",
  "sinks": "None. No data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "None. The code only sets up exception handling and module assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, assigns it to a sys.modules dictionary entry, and defines an exception class. The exception class is straightforward and used for error handling. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The code appears to be part of a larger project setup rather than containing malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard setup tasks for a module and exception class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
