  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API errors and assign an imported module to a specific sys.modules entry.",
  "sources": "The import statement for sys and the local import of the openapi module.",
  "targets": "Assigning openapi to sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'], and the custom exception class usage.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> assign sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'] = openapi",
  "anomalies": "The reassignment of sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'] to a locally imported module is unusual but not inherently malicious; no code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a relative module 'longbridge.openapi'. It then overwrites an entry in sys.modules with this imported module, potentially affecting how other parts of the application access 'longbridge.openapi'. It defines a custom exception class 'OpenApiException' for API error handling, which is then assigned to the openapi module, replacing or extending its exception class. No external input, insecure data handling, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to modify module references for internal consistency or customization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The reassignment of sys.modules is unusual but not harmful without further context. The overall code is safe, serving to customize exception handling and module references.",
