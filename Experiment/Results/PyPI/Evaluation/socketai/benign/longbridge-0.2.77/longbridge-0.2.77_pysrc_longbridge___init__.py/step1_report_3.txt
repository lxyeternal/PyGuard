{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling API-related errors and assigns it to an existing module.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module, imports openapi from relative module, assigns exception class to openapi.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "Defines exception class and assigns it to openapi, but no data flow from external inputs to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and a local openapi module, then replaces or extends the openapi.OpenApiException with a custom exception class. The custom class merely encapsulates error code and message, with no input validation or external data processing. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or other potentially malicious actions. It appears to serve a straightforward purpose of exception handling without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class and its assignment within the openapi module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
