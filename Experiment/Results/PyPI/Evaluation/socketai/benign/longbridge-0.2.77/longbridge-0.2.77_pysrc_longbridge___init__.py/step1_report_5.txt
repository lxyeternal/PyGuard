  "purpose": "Define and override a custom exception class for handling API errors, and modify module imports for the 'longbridge.openapi' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and the local module longbridge.openapi.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'], and setting openapi.OpenApiException.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> override sys.modules['longbridge.openapi'] with openapi -> define OpenApiException -> assign OpenApiException to openapi.OpenApiException.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the assignment to sys.modules is a form of monkey patching but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a local 'longbridge.openapi' module. It then replaces the 'longbridge.openapi' entry in sys.modules with the imported openapi object, effectively redirecting any future imports of 'longbridge.openapi' to this object. It defines a custom exception class 'OpenApiException' with custom string representation. Subsequently, it assigns this custom exception to 'openapi.OpenApiException', potentially overriding existing behavior. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a structural modification to control exception handling and module import behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import and exception class definition operations with a form of monkey patching of the openapi module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present. The code is straightforward and appears intended for controlled exception handling.",
