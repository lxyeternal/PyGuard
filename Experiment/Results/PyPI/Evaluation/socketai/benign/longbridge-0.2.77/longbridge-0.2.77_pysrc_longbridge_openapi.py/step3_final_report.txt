  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network communication, data processing points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input/read sources to network/file/environment sinks, potential for malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation suspicion, dynamic code execution hints, network activity without clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across all reports, with minimal or no suspicious features. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores, with low to moderate security risks. Report 2 indicates some suspicion of obfuscation and network activity, but no concrete malicious behavior is confirmed. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments suggest slightly lowering risk and obfuscation scores in Report 2 for consistency, as no definitive malicious activity is observed. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting the limited code context but reasonable suspicion assessments.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code is unlikely malicious, with scores aligning well with the observations. Slight score reductions in Report 2 improve consistency, but current assessments are already cautious without evidence of malicious intent.",
