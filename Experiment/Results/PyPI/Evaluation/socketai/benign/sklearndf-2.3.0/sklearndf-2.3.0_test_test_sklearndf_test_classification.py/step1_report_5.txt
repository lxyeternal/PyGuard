{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for various sklearn-compatible classifiers, specifically testing the fit and predict functionalities of custom classifier wrappers in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, test data (iris_features, iris_target_sr, iris_targets_df, iris_targets_binary_df), and class attributes. No external input is explicitly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code performs predictions and probability calculations that involve data outputs, but no untrusted data outputs or external data leaks are evident. No sensitive data or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (iris features and targets) flow through fit, predict, and probability methods to produce predictions, with no external untrusted data flow or command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, hidden network communications, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard testing frameworks and sklearn wrappers with typical data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test suite for classifier models, verifying their fit and predict functions, including probability predictions. It imports multiple standard libraries, testing tools, and custom classifiers. Data is loaded from test datasets, then classifiers are instantiated and tested for expected behaviors. No code injections, hidden network activity, or malicious logic are evident. The code does not manipulate environment variables or perform any system-level operations. It primarily performs in-memory data processing with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate testing suite for machine learning classifiers with no malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. It strictly adheres to testing standards without engaging in any harmful actions or data leaks.",
