{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for various sklearn-compatible classifiers within the sklearndf library, validating fit, predict, predict_proba, and partial_fit methods using standard datasets.",
  "sources": "Test fixture datasets such as iris_features, iris_target_sr, iris_targets_df, and iris_targets_binary_df; data is internally supplied and controlled.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from input datasets through classifier methods; no external or untrusted data sources or network interactions are involved.",
  "flows": "Input datasets (sources) are fed into classifier.fit(), predictions are generated via classifier.predict() and classifier.predict_proba(), with data flow confined within the testing environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML testing procedures using common libraries and datasets, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The tests validate classifier functionality and output correctness. No external data, network activity, or credential handling is involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, controlled testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal risk scores reflect the safe, controlled testing context.",
