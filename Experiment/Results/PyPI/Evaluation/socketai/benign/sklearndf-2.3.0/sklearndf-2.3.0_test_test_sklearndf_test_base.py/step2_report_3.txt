  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a collection of unit tests and class definitions related to scikit-learn estimators, wrappers, and pipelines.\n- No external untrusted input, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- The functions perform cloning, parameter setting, representation, and validation.\n- The code appears to be standard testing code, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n- The regex used in HTML output is for test consistency, not malicious manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing cloning, representation, and validation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the lack of external inputs or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar testing focus.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still very low, consistent with safe testing code.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, testing estimators and wrappers.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing cloning, representation, validation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly assess the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero, given the nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are minimal, reflecting the safe, testing-focused purpose.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The regex manipulation in HTML output is a standard test practice, not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all.\n- **Risk scores:** Keep very low, around 0.1–0.2, as they are justified.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, safe test suite for estimator wrappers and does not pose any security threat.",
