{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests and class definitions for scikit-learn estimator wrappers, focusing on cloning, representation, parameter validation, and HTML visualization. It is intended for internal testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "In-memory objects, class methods, and functions; no external or untrusted input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external data sinks are present; operations are confined to internal object manipulations.",
  "flows": "Operations involve cloning objects, setting and getting parameters, and generating string or HTML representations, all within controlled test environments.",
  "anomalies": "The regex in '_replace_ids' is used solely for test output normalization; no malicious obfuscation or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for estimator wrappers, with no external data, network activity, or malicious patterns. It employs straightforward cloning, parameter validation, and representation methods. The regex used is for test consistency, not malicious intent. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The code is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe testing suite with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk negligible (~0.1).",
