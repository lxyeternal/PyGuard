{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based test functions validating sklearndf estimators, pipelines, and stacking models. It performs model instantiation, warning/error handling, fitting, and prediction, with no external or malicious data sources involved.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (pandas DataFrames and Series); no external data or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Standard fit and predict methods; data flows internally within models. No external data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into model fit/predict methods; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard testing routines for ML estimators, pipelines, and stacking models. It includes warning and exception handling for invalid estimator types. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is limited to local model operations, with no external data handling or network activity. The code's structure and purpose are benign, focused on validation of ML components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for scikit-learn-compatible estimators and pipelines. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behaviors are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are consistent with the analysis.",
