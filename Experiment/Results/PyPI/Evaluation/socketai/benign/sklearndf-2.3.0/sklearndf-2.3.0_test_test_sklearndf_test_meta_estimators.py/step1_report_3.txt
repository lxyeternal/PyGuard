{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for validating the behavior and correctness of various scikit-learn compatible estimators and pipelines within the sklearndf package. It tests estimator types, warnings, errors, and stacking regressor/classifier functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (diabetes_features, diabetes_target_sr, iris_features, iris_target_sr), creates and configures estimators, pipelines, and stacking models, and calls their fit and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs predictions via the fit/predict methods, uses print statements for debugging, and assigns objects to variables. No untrusted data from external sources or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data (features and targets) through model fitting, then predictions are generated. Estimator configurations and pipelines are created and executed locally without external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code includes warnings and exception handling for expected misuse scenarios, which are normal in testing environments. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard testing procedures for machine learning models, including validation of estimator types, warning and error handling, and pipeline execution. It uses typical scikit-learn and sklearndf API calls with no signs of malicious behavior. The presence of print statements is typical for debugging but not suspicious. The code does not contain any network operations, file manipulations, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for a machine learning package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily tests functionality, warnings, and error handling in a controlled environment.",
