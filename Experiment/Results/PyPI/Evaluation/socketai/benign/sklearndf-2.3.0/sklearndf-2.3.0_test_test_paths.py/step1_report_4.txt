  "purpose": "Set up logging and define directory/file paths for a Python application.",
  "sources": "os.path.join() function to construct the path for 'test_config.yml' using the 'config' directory.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data or input.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from hardcoded directory variables to path construction, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard library features without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and os modules, initializes a logger, and defines constants for data and config directories. It then constructs a path to a configuration YAML file within the config directory. There are no user inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be part of a larger system for configuration management and logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines some constants and a logger configuration.",
