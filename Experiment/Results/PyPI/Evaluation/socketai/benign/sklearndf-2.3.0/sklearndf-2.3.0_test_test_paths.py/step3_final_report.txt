  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for directory names and file paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static constants used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets up a logger, and defines static path constants. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as configuration/setup code, with all signals indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static setup code with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
