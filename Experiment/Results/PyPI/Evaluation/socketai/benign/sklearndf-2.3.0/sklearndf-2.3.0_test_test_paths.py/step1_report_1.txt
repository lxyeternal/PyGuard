  "purpose": "Set up logging and define file paths for data and configuration directories.",
  "sources": "Constants defining directory paths and a configuration file path, referencing environment variables indirectly through os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants and logger setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger, defines static directory paths, and constructs a file path using os.path.join. There are no user inputs, no data processing, or external network activities. The code appears to be standard setup code with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward setup code for logging and file path configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
