  "purpose": "Define logging and set up directory and file path constants for data and configuration files.",
  "sources": "os.path.join() for constructing file paths from constants",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed or outputted in a potentially unsafe manner",
  "flows": "Constants DIR_CONFIG and string literals are combined to form TEST_CONFIG_YML path; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger and defines constants for directory paths and a configuration file path using os.path.join. There are no user inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward and uses standard practices for setting up configuration paths. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, safe setup for logging and configuration path definitions. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
