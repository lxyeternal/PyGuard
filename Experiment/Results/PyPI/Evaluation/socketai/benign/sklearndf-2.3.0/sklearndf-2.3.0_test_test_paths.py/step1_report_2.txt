{
  "purpose": "Initialize logging and define file and directory paths for data and configuration files.",
  "sources": "os.path.join() with constant strings, reading no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data flow is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely sets up constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and os modules, sets up a logger, and defines constants for directory and file paths. All paths are hardcoded and static. No external input, data processing, or network activity occurs. The code appears standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on setting up logging and defining static paths. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
