  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger, sets up directory paths as constant strings, and constructs a file path using os.path.join. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a basic configuration purpose with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
