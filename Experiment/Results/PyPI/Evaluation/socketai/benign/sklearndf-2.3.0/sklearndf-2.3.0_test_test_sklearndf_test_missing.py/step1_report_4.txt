  "purpose": "Unit test for a custom missing estimator class in the sklearndf.wrapper module",
  "sources": "Import statements: logging, pytest, and the MissingEstimator class from sklearndf.wrapper",
  "sinks": "The instantiation of MyMissingEstimator which raises RuntimeError if the estimator is missing",
  "flows": "Calling MyMissingEstimator(1, '2', a=2) triggers RuntimeError if estimator is missing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. The code simply tests behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard logging and pytest modules, then defines a test function. Within, it subclasses MissingEstimator and attempts to instantiate it, expecting a RuntimeError with a specific message if the estimator isn't available. No data leaks, no network connections, nor suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard test code for a missing dependency scenario.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test designed to verify behavior when an estimator is missing. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code's purpose is testing error handling for missing dependencies, and it is benign.",
