  "purpose": "Unit test to verify that instantiating a subclass of MissingEstimator raises a RuntimeError indicating the estimator is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statements, subclass definition, instantiation of MyMissingEstimator with parameters",
  "sinks": "The instantiation line where the RuntimeError is expected to be raised",
  "flows": "Creating MyMissingEstimator instance leads to the RuntimeError being triggered",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a class from a library, defines a subclass, and asserts that instantiating this subclass raises a specific RuntimeError. The logic is simple, with no data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present. The code serves as a standard error handling test case for missing dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying error handling for a missing estimator. No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
