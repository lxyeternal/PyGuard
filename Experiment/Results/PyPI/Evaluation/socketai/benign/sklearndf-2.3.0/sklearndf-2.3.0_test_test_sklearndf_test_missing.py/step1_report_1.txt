  "purpose": "Unit testing for MissingEstimator class in sklearndf.wrapper module",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging, pytest, and the MissingEstimator class",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data leaks, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; test instantiates class and expects exception",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard testing pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test case for a missing estimator class, defining a subclass and asserting that instantiation raises a RuntimeError with a specific message. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage behavior is present. Imports are standard for testing; no embedded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward unit test with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely tests expected error handling behavior of the MissingEstimator class.",
