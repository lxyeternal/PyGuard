  "purpose": "Unit test to verify behavior of MissingEstimator from sklearndf.wrapper when estimator is missing.",
  "sources": "Imports from logging, pytest, and sklearndf.wrapper; class instantiation of MissingEstimator",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful effects",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to any sinks; the test raises an exception intentionally during class instantiation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a straightforward test case with no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and testing libraries, defines a test function that creates a subclass of MissingEstimator, and asserts that instantiating this subclass raises a RuntimeError with a specific message. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The code simply tests error handling for a missing estimator. No external data sources or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a missing estimator scenario, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
