{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting and wrapping scikit-learn classes and modules, primarily for enhancing or extending scikit-learn estimators with additional functionality, likely for data transformation and machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules, variables within modules (vars(_m)), sys.modules for submodule discovery, class attributes, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations such as network calls, file operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs introspection: gathering classes and modules, mapping classes, and checking for expected errors. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code relies on standard Python introspection and class handling without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically finds classes and submodules, maps sklearn classes to custom wrappers, and checks for expected errors in estimators. All operations are confined to introspection, class mapping, and error handling. No network activity, file access, or system modifications are evident. Functions are well-structured for extension, with no suspicious patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for enhancing scikit-learn workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions intended for class and module introspection, class wrapping, and error checking within a scikit-learn extension framework. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
