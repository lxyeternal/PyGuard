{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for discovering, mapping, and wrapping sklearn classes with custom sklearndf wrapper classes, as well as testing for proper error handling in estimators.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions from modules via vars(), sys.modules for submodule discovery, and data from pandas DataFrame in test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls methods like predict and transform on estimators, and raises exceptions based on their behavior. It does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (test_x) flows into predict/transform methods; class information flows from modules and sys.modules; error handling flow occurs during method calls to verify estimator states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Use of eval-like dynamic class mapping and regex-based filtering are typical in plugin systems; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically finds classes and submodules, maps sklearn to custom wrappers, filters classes by name, and tests estimator error handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent. The functions serve standard purposes of plugin discovery and validation without external network or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code performs safe introspection and testing within a typical machine learning framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended for managing and testing sklearn wrapper classes. No malicious activity or security risks are identified. It is a well-structured utility module with no signs of sabotage.",
