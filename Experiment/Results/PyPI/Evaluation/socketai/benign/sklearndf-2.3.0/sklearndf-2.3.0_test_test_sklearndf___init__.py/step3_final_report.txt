  "purpose": "Utility functions for discovering, mapping, and testing scikit-learn and sklearndf classes, including class discovery, module inspection, and validation of estimators.",
  "sources": "Uses vars() to inspect module attributes, sys.modules to find submodules, and getattr() to invoke methods like predict and transform.",
  "sinks": "Method calls via getattr() on estimator objects, exception handling for NotFittedError.",
  "flows": "Source data (class definitions, module attributes) flows into reflection and method invocation, with exception handling for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious patterns; standard reflection and dynamic method calls. Slight concern over dynamic getattr() if modules are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs class discovery through vars() and sys.modules, maps classes via dictionaries, and tests estimators by invoking predict/transform methods. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The use of getattr() is typical for such utility functions but could be exploited if untrusted modules are used. Exception handling is thorough, focusing on NotFittedError. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing scikit-learn and sklearndf classes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reflection and dynamic invocation are typical for plugin-like systems and do not indicate malicious intent. The low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate given the context.",
