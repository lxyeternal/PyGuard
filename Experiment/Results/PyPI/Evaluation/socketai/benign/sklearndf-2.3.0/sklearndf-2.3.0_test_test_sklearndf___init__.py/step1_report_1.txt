{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to facilitate the integration, discovery, and testing of scikit-learn and sklearndf wrapper classes, primarily for managing estimators and transformers in a modular, dynamic manner.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions and module variables via vars(), module attributes, sys.modules, and regular expressions on class names.",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as getattr() to invoke methods like 'predict' or 'transform' on estimator objects, and exception handling related to estimator states.",
  "flows": "Sources of class and module information feed into functions that generate class mappings and filtered class lists. These are used to obtain wrapper classes and perform fit state checks via method calls and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python reflection, type checks, and exception handling without obfuscation or hidden behavior. The module imports and class discovery processes are typical for dynamic class management.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs reflection-based discovery of classes and modules, maps sklearn classes to custom wrapper classes, filters classes by name patterns, and verifies estimator fit states through controlled test calls. It relies on standard Python and scikit-learn APIs with no signs of hidden or malicious code. No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The exception handling is consistent with normal testing procedures. All imported modules and functions are standard or related to the project, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing and testing scikit-learn wrappers within a modular framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard class discovery, mapping, and validation routines typical for such tooling.",
