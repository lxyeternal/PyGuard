{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures for testing scikit-learn datasets and their transformation into pandas DataFrames, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading data from sklearn datasets (datasets.load_diabetes, datasets.load_iris), environment variables not used, no input from external untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "DataFrames, Series, and variables within the script, no external sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Loading datasets -> converting to DataFrame -> dropping or transforming columns -> passing data into sklearn and custom encoders.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling. The code primarily performs data loading and transformation for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, loads datasets from scikit-learn, and transforms them into pandas DataFrames, which is typical for data analysis and testing. The use of fixtures indicates testing setup, not runtime or production malicious activity. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common data science practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for datasets and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not include any suspicious data handling, network activity, or backdoors. Overall, it appears safe.",
