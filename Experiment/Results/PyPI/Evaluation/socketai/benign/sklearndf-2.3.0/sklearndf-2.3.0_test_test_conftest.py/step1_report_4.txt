{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for data preprocessing and testing using scikit-learn, pandas, and pytest, mainly to load datasets, convert them into data frames, and prepare data for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Data is read from scikit-learn datasets (load_diabetes, load_iris), and pandas data frames are created from numpy arrays and dataset attributes. No external inputs or untrusted sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not perform network communication, file writes, or any actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from scikit-learn datasets into pandas data frames, with transformations such as feature selection and one-hot encoding. There are no flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected. The import statements, fixture definitions, and dataset conversions follow standard practices. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads standard datasets from scikit-learn, converts them into pandas data frames, and performs typical preprocessing steps like dropping columns and encoding categories. All operations are typical for data science workflows. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The fixtures are used for testing purposes and do not involve untrusted input or side effects beyond data setup. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading and preprocessing script used in machine learning testing environments. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and purely for data preparation and testing.",
