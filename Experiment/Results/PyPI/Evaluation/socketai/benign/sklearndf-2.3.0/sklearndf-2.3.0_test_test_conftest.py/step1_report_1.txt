{
  "purpose": "The code provides data loading, transformation, and fixture setup for testing scikit-learn and pandas-based data processing workflows, primarily for unit testing machine learning pipelines.",
  "sources": "Data sources include sklearn datasets (load_diabetes, load_iris), environment variables indirectly through import statements, and function parameters for fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network or file system writes, no command executions, and no use of environment variables or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from sklearn datasets, converted into pandas DataFrames or Series, and transformed via fixtures and encoders; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The code mainly consists of data loading and fixture setup for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several sklearn and pandas modules, loads datasets, converts them to DataFrames, and prepares data for testing purposes. It uses version checks and fixtures appropriately. No external calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The only notable aspect is the use of fixtures, which are standard in testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for testing machine learning workflows, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
