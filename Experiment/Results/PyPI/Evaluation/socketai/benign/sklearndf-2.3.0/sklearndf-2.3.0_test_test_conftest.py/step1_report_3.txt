{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for loading and transforming datasets from scikit-learn for data analysis or machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading dataset from scikit-learn's datasets.load_* functions, reading environment variables if any (none explicitly), reading configuration via fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or subprocess calls. No suspicious output operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into pandas DataFrames and Series, then transformed via one-hot encoding. No untrusted input flows to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code is structured as typical test fixtures and data loading routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data science libraries, defines fixtures for datasets, converts sklearn datasets to pandas DataFrames, and applies simple transformations. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses version checks for compatibility and standard library functions. All operations are standard data loading and preprocessing tasks with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test data setup for machine learning workflows with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in nature and contains no malicious behavior.",
