{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup for Azure Machine Learning filesystem integration, importing and exposing relevant classes and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local '.spec' module, importing constants and classes for internal use or testing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Static import of constants and classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific components from a local module and exposes a class via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import statements are static, and the code is standard boilerplate for module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
