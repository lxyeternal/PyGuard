  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import/export module setup.\n- No data processing, user input handling, or network activity is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be standard boilerplate for exposing classes and constants from a local module.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity.\n- The purpose is solely to facilitate filesystem integration with Azure ML, not to process or handle untrusted data.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- The code is straightforward, and no issues are evident.\n- No logical flaws, security risks, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The import statements are static and do not involve dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign module setup with no security concerns.",
