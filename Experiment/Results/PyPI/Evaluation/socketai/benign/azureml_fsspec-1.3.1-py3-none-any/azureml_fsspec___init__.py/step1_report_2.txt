  "purpose": "The code provides an import interface for Azure Machine Learning filesystem integration, exposing constants and classes related to Azure ML URIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from the '.spec' module, including classes and constants related to Azure ML file systems and URI handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code; it only exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs; the code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from a local module '.spec' and defines __all__ for export. There are no functions, user input handling, or external data processing. It appears to be a standard module initialization with no malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for Azure ML filesystem integration. It only exposes existing classes and constants, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
