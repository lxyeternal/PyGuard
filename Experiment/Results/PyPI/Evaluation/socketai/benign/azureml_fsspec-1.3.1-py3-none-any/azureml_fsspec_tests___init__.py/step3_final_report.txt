  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, file operations, network calls, subprocess executions, system time retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, subprocesses, system commands, print statements.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into network/file/subprocess operations; data from sources may reach sinks directly or via transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious domains, or malicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are simple, with no evidence of malicious intent. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious external connections are present. The confidence scores reflect the clarity and benign nature of the code. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. The security risk scores are low, indicating minimal threat. The assessments are aligned with the descriptions and reasoning provided.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious activity detected. The scores are justified and consistent with the code analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.",
