{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and possibly environment variables or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data may be outputted to files, network sockets, or printed to console; these are typical sink points for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output sinks, though no explicit network or file operations are shown in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious string operations, or obfuscated code are immediately evident. No unusual or suspicious library usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python syntax with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. It lacks network activity, system modification commands, or credential handling. The absence of obvious external input/output points makes malicious behavior unlikely. However, without full context or additional code, subtle behaviors cannot be entirely ruled out.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators.",
