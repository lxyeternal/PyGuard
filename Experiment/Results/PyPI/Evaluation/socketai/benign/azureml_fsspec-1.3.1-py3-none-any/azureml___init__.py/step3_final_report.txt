  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and access to __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ with extend_path -> no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal, standard pattern for namespace package support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ variable using 'extend_path', a common pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, with no data input, network activity, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used in Python packaging for namespace support. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
