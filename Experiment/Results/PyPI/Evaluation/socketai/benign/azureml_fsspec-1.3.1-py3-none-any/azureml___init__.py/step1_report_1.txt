  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module, usage of __path__, and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows are evident in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the '__path__' variable for namespace package support, a common practice in Python packaging. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or data leaks. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a standard purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace package extension snippet with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
