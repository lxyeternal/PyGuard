  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and accessing '__path__' and '__name__'",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or outputted",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code is standard for namespace package extension, no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the '__path__' attribute of the package, which is a common practice in Python namespace packages. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling. There are no indications of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard implementation for namespace package support in Python and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
