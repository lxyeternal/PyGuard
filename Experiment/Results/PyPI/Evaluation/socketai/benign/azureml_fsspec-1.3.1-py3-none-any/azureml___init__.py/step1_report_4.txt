  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module for extending __path__",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> extend_path method called to modify __path__",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' and dynamic extension of __path__ is standard for namespace packages; no unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module using the built-in __import__ function. It then calls 'extend_path' to extend the __path__ variable with additional paths, which is a common pattern to implement namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
