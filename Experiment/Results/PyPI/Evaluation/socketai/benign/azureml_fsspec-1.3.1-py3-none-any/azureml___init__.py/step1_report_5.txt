  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ variable to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and dynamically imports 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing 'pkgutil', calling extend_path with __path__ and __name__, modifying __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard namespace package pattern, no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal pattern used to support namespace packages by extending __path__ with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. It is a common practice in Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are observed. It performs a straightforward function related to package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package extension snippet without malicious intent or security risks.",
