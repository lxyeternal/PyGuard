  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' to extending '__path__' with 'extend_path'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and performs a standard package resource extension; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, which is a common pattern in namespace packages to combine multiple resource directories. The implementation appears standard and intended for package resource management without involving any user input, data flow, or external communication. There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is concise and typical for package setup or namespace handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package resource handling.",
