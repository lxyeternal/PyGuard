  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework by setting up plugin modules and modifying the system path for test imports.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ for current directory path, imports sys, pytest, os.path, and constants from utilities.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to determine current directory, appends a relative path to sys.path, imports modules, and adds marker to pytest items.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard pytest plugin setup and path adjustment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the environment for pytest testing by importing necessary modules, adjusting the system path to include test scenarios, and defining a hook to add an owner marker if missing. It does not include any network activity, data leakage, credential handling, or malicious payloads. The path modification ensures test modules can access common code without altering the test structure, which is a common practice. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup for pytest configuration and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages test environment setup with no indications of malware or security issues.",
