{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a testing environment with pytest, adding custom plugins and markers for test collection and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file path (__file__), imports sys, pytest, and os modules, and dynamically modifies sys.path to include a specific directory for test scenarios. It also imports a constants module within a function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present. No network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "The code adds a directory to sys.path based on the current file location, then defines a pytest hook that imports a constants module and adds a marker based on a constant value. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The only potentially notable behavior is dynamically modifying sys.path and importing constants during test collection.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages test setup, modifying sys.path for test discovery and defining a pytest hook. It uses constants for assigning markers, which is standard in test configuration. No malicious or suspicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The dynamic sys.path modification is common in test environments but could be misused if the added path contains malicious code; however, it appears to be controlled and predictable based on the directory structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup script configuring pytest plugins and markers with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic path adjustment is typical for test environments and does not indicate malicious activity.",
