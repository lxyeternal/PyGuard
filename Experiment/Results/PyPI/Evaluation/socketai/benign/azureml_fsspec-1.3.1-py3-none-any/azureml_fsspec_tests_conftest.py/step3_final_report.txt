  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment by setting up plugin markers and modifying sys.path for test discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine current directory, importing constants for owner email.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) used to construct path, which is then used for sys.path modification; constants imported for marker annotation.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic modification of sys.path based on current file location; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest setup script that appends a directory to sys.path based on the current file's location and adds an owner marker to test items if missing. It imports constants for owner email. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The path modification is deterministic and controlled, typical for test environments. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's behavior is benign, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest configuration script used for test setup. It involves controlled path modification and marker addition, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The current scores in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be minimal (~0.1) due to path manipulation but is justified given the controlled context.",
