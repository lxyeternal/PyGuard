  "purpose": "Defines support features for SQLAlchemy dialect testing via properties returning static support status.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; properties return static values from the testing framework.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static property returns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration class with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass defining feature support properties for testing purposes, using standard framework functions. It contains no external data, network activity, or malicious code. The use of 'exclusions.open()' and 'exclusions.closed()' is typical for test configurations. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, indicating feature support status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely configuration-oriented, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard test setup. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are accurate and appropriate.",
