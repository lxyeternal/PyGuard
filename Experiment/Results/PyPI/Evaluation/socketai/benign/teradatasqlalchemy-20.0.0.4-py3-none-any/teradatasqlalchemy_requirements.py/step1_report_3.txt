  "purpose": "Define test requirements for a SQLAlchemy dialect related to feature support.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only imports from SQLAlchemy testing modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; the code only defines properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exclusions.open()' and 'exclusions.closed()' to specify feature support, which is standard for testing and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing requirements and defines a subclass 'Requirements' that specifies support for certain database features using property methods. The methods return exclusions states (open or closed), which are standard in testing frameworks to indicate feature support or lack thereof. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be part of a testing suite for SQLAlchemy dialects, with no malicious intent or malware signatures present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign component of a testing framework, used to specify feature support in database dialect testing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
