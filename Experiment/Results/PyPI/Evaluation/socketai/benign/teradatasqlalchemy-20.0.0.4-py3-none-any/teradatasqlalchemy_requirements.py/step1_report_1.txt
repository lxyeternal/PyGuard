  "purpose": "This code defines a class Requirements for testing SQLAlchemy dialect support features.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines class properties.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present; the code mainly sets property flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to SQLAlchemy testing and defines a class with properties indicating support or lack thereof for specific database features. All code appears to be related to test configurations, with no user input handling, no data leaks, and no malicious code or obfuscation present. It is purely declarative and configuration-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for testing database feature support, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
