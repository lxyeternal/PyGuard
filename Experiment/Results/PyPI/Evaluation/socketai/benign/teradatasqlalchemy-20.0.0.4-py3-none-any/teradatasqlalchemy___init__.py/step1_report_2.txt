{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports data type constants and version information for a Teradata database driver module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules (.types and vernumber), and standard library __version__ assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and variable assignments are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports type definitions and version info, then exposes a predefined list of constants for database types. It includes an import of a module 'teradatasql' but does not invoke any functions or methods from it. There are no user inputs, network activities, or executable code beyond simple assignments and exports. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors are present. The presence of 'teradatasql' may be for database interaction in other parts of the package, but in this snippet, it does not pose a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module for defining and exporting database type constants and version info. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. The code appears safe and standard for a Python package component.",
