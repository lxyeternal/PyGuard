  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard module defining constants and version info, importing from local modules and teradatasql.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or execution of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code is static, straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct. No malware detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct. Code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0 — Correct. No security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward imports and constants.  \n- No suspicious behavior or dynamic code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: static imports, no dynamic code, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment: no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior, standard imports.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Slightly different: confidence is 0.9, and securityRisk is 0.1, but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The mention of the 'teradatasql' library as a potential concern is acknowledged but dismissed as standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct, no malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly elevated but justified, considering the import of a database client library, which is common and not inherently risky.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, imports constants, and sets version info without executing untrusted data or dynamic code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** The slight risk score of 0.1 in Report 5 is justified due to the presence of the database client library, but it's not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correct at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay at 0 unless future code introduces dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks identified in this static snippet.\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, benign module for defining database type constants and importing a database library, with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
