  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple module that imports type constants, version info, and the teradatasql library, then exports a list of constants and version info. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and does not process untrusted input or perform any network or file operations within this snippet.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n- The import of `teradatasql` is standard for database connectivity, and in this context, it does not pose an immediate security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and concerns:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description—importing types, version info, and exporting constants. No anomalies are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent:** None detected. The code is static and conventional.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Since no dynamic or user-input code exists here, the potential for vulnerabilities is minimal. The only minor concern is the import of `teradatasql`, but without further context, it’s standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  \n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n  \n  - **Security risk:** All assign 0 or near-zero, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:** None are assigned, and this is appropriate given the static nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n- No report suggests any assumptions that are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential adjustments:** No adjustments needed; the scores reflect the benign assessment.\n\n- **Additional considerations:** Since the code is static and does not execute any dynamic code or handle untrusted data, no further security concerns are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, static module importing constants and version info, with an import of a database client library that is not used within this snippet. All reports correctly assess it as benign with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, and the current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
