{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a collection of database type constants and version information, and imports relevant modules for database interactions.",
  "sources": "The code imports type definitions from a local module (.types), version info from vernumber, and the teradatasql library.",
  "sinks": "The only external library imported is teradatasql, which may be used for database connectivity, but no direct usage or execution of untrusted data occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns version info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard module setup for type constants and versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports various database type constants from a local module, sets a version number, and exports these constants. It also imports the teradatasql library, likely for database operations elsewhere. There are no dynamic executions, no input handling, and no suspicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All activities are static definitions and imports typical for a database client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious module that defines constants for database types and imports necessary modules for database interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
