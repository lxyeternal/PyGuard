  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a static module that imports type constants from a local module, assigns a version number, and imports the `teradatasql` library.\n- There are no functions, dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations.\n- The code appears to be a typical setup for a database client library, defining constants and importing dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed analysis of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines and exports database type constants and version info.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic execution, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining constants and version info.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The slightly non-zero risk score (0.1) is justifiable given the import of `teradatasql`, which is a database driver library. While importing a library is standard, in some contexts, this could be a surface for supply chain risks if the library were compromised. However, in this static code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** Correct at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correct at 0.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero is acceptable here, but it could be lowered to 0 unless there's a specific concern about the library.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and standard.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only minor point is the small security risk score (0.1) in report 5, which could be justified due to the presence of an external library (`teradatasql`). However, since the code does not execute or process untrusted data, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no significant security risk, just a dependency import)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would keep them at:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard module for defining database type constants and importing dependencies. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
