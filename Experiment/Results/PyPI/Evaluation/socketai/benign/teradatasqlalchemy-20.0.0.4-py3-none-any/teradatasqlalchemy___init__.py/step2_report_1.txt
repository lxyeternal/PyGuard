  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward module defining constants, importing version info, and importing the teradatasql library.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors.\n- The presence of the teradatasql library is standard for database interaction, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No issues, standard module setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, but notes the import of 'teradatasql' as standard, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but given the code's static nature, this is probably an overestimate. The 'teradatasql' library is standard, and importing it alone doesn't pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with 0 for all.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static, defines constants, and imports a database library, the overall security risk should be minimal. The only minor concern is the import of 'teradatasql', which could be misused elsewhere, but within this snippet, it's benign.\n\n**The most appropriate risk score:**  \n- **Given the static nature and lack of dynamic or malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.0 to 0.1 is appropriate.**  \n- The fifth report's 0.1 is slightly high but still acceptable considering cautious risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report # | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments |\n|------------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1          | 0       | 0            | 0              | Fully appropriate |\n| 2          | 0       | 0            | 0              | Fully appropriate |\n| 3          | 0       | 0            | 0              | Fully appropriate |\n| 4          | 0       | 0            | 0              | Fully appropriate |\n| 5          | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Slightly conservative but acceptable |\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0.0 or very close to it, e.g., 0.05, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (or 0 if strict minimal risk is preferred)\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the static, benign nature of this code snippet. The minor security risk score in report 5 could be slightly lowered, but overall, the assessments are reasonable.",
