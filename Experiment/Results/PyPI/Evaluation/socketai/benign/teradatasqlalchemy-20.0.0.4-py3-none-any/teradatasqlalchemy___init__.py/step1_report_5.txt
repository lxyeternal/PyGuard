{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export data type constants for a Teradata database client library, and imports version information and the teradatasql module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .types module for data type constants, and vernumber for version info; also imports teradatasql module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file I/O, or data handling from untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly establishes constants and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; the code is a straightforward module defining constants and importing libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module for a database client library, importing data types and version info, and exporting constants. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or network communication. The import of teradatasql could be a concern if it contains malicious code, but as a standard library, its presence alone is not suspicious. The code structure and content do not indicate any obfuscated or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural part of a database client library, defining data types and importing necessary modules. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
