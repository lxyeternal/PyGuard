{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports database type constants, version info, and imports the teradatasql library for database connectivity.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.types, vernumber) and the teradatasql library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a comprehensive set of data type constants, assigns a version number, and imports the teradatasql library, likely for database interactions. It then exports these constants and version info via __all__. There are no functions, dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The presence of teradatasql is standard for database connectivity and does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to a benign, static module intended for defining constants and dependencies. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for defining database-related constants and importing a database client library. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security risk score should be 0, malware score 0, and obfuscated score 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
