{
  "purpose": "Defines data type constants and version information for a Teradata database library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.types and vernumber), and the imported 'teradatasql' library.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling present; mainly setting constants and version info.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and exports constants and modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The import of 'teradatasql' appears standard for database connectivity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various type constants from a local module and version info from another, then exposes them via '__all__'. It also imports 'teradatasql', which is a standard database client library for Teradata. No data manipulation, input handling, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and typical for a module defining constants and importing a database client library.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign module for setting up data type constants and version information related to Teradata. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The import of 'teradatasql' is standard for database interaction. Overall, it is a safe and standard component with no security concerns.",
