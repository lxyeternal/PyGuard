{
  "purpose": "This module defines and exports data type constants for Teradata database interactions and imports versioning information and the teradatasql library for database connectivity.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.types and vernumber) and the teradatasql library.",
  "sinks": "Usage of the teradatasql library could be a sink if it involves database operations with untrusted input, but no such operations are shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident within this snippet; the code mainly sets up constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves imports and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various data type constants from a local types module, references a version number from vernumber, and imports the teradatasql library for database interaction. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The overall structure is standard for a library module providing constants and dependencies. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module setting up constants and dependencies for database operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this snippet.",
