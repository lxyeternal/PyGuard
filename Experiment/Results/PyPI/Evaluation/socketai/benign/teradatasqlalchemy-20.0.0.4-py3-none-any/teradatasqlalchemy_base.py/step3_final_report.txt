  "purpose": "Extension of SQLAlchemy for Teradata, providing custom execution context, identifier preparer, and DDL elements for schema management.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern in should_autocommit_text method; SQL string formatting in visit_create_view and related functions.",
  "sinks": "SQL command strings generated for view creation, dropping, and table creation; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Regex matches SQL statements to determine autocommit; formatted SQL strings are compiled and executed within database context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard regex pattern and SQL string formatting used.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SQLAlchemy extensions for Teradata, with regex used solely for pattern matching of SQL commands to decide autocommit behavior. SQL strings are safely formatted using SQLAlchemy's compiler utilities, minimizing injection risks. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present. The regex pattern is a common approach and does not introduce security concerns. The code relies on trusted modules and standard practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension for SQLAlchemy tailored to Teradata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score assigned in the reports is appropriate. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain threats.",
