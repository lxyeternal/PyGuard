  "purpose": "Configuration class managing 'usexviews' boolean parameter with controlled attribute access and type validation.",
  "sources": "Constructor initializing 'usexviews', attribute setters and getters, internal methods for attribute management.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor and property methods flow to internal attribute storage; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python class inheritance, property decorators, and internal attribute management to control access to a boolean configuration parameter. It enforces type safety and encapsulation without external dependencies or network interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The design is straightforward and adheres to best practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minimal security risk scores in some reports can be adjusted to zero, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
