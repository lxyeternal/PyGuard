  "purpose": "A utility decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are used.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'deprecated' and the warnings.warn() call within the wrapper.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() outputs to the warning system; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Function call to the decorated function triggers the wrapper, which issues a warning before executing the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard deprecation decorator using warnings and functools modules. It wraps functions to emit a deprecation warning with optional replacement info. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and well-structured. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are evident. The code serves a maintenance purpose and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for deprecation warnings with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to warning issuance. Overall, it is safe and well-understood.",
