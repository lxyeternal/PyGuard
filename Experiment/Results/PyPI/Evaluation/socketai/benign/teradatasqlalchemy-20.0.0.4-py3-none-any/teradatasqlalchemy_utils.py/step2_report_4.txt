  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code defines a standard Python decorator for deprecation warnings.\n- It uses the `warnings` module and `functools.wraps` appropriately.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O are involved.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden backdoors.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and readable.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low score (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, this is reasonable. The minimal risk score accounts for the fact that warnings could be misused if warnings are mishandled, but in this context, it’s negligible.\n\n4. **Purpose and Analysis:** All reports correctly identify that this is a benign utility function for deprecation warnings, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor point is the first report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly higher than the others. Given the code's benign nature, this should be 0.0 for consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the code and reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since the code is safe and straightforward)\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe utility with no malicious intent. The scores reflect this accurately.",
