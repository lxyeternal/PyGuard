{
  "purpose": "The code defines a deprecation decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings when such functions are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads function definitions, function calls, and warnings issuance within the wrapper function.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn call potentially outputs messages to the user, which is a benign side effect in this context.",
  "flows": "When a decorated function is called, the wrapper issues a warning message and then executes the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a deprecation decorator that wraps functions to emit a deprecation warning when called. It uses standard library functions warnings.warn and wraps functions with functools.wraps. The code does not include any input/output from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be a standard utility for API evolution management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious intent or security risks.",
