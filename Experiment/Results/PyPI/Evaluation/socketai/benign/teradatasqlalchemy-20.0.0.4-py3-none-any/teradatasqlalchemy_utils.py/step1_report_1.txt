  "purpose": "Define a deprecation decorator to warn users about deprecated functions and suggest replacements.",
  "sources": "The code reads function metadata and uses the warnings module to generate warnings.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function could potentially be a sink if warnings are mishandled or exploited, but in this context, it is used for benign user notification.",
  "flows": "Function call to the decorator -> wrapper function executes -> warnings.warn() is called -> original function executes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code implements a standard deprecation pattern with no suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deprecated' that attaches a wrapper to any function, issuing a deprecation warning when invoked. It uses the 'warnings' module to notify users about deprecation status and optional replacement functions. The implementation is straightforward, using standard Python practices. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical utility function for code maintenance, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation decorator used for signaling deprecated functions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and serves a maintenance purpose only.",
