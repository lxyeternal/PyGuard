  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign implementation of a deprecation decorator.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, write to external systems, or contain any obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The warnings.warn() function is used solely for user notification and does not pose a security risk in this context.\n- No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical utility function for API maintenance.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign very low risk (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable because the code could potentially be misused if integrated into a larger system with malicious intent, but as-is, it’s safe.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are very consistent and accurate; no anomalies or suspicious claims are present.\n- The confidence level is 1.0 across all reports, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound, with no overestimations of risk.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Since the code is standard and safe, I would maintain the current scores.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased from 0.1 to 0.2 if we consider that misuse of warnings in a malicious context (e.g., to mislead users) is highly unlikely but theoretically possible. However, given the benign analysis, keeping it at 0.1 or 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0.2, but 0.1 is fine)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-understood pattern for deprecation warnings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present, and the current scoring accurately reflects this.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain the security risk score at 0.1 or 0, given the context.\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
