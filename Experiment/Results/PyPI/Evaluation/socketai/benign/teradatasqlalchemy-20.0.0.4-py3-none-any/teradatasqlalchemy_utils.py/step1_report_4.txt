{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator to mark functions as deprecated and inform users about the deprecation, optionally suggesting a replacement.",
  "sources": "The code reads from function parameters (`func`, `args`, `kwargs`) and uses `warnings.warn` to emit warnings.",
  "sinks": "The `warnings.warn` function could potentially be used maliciously if called with untrusted input, but here it is used with fixed messages and parameters.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: when the `deprecated` decorator is applied, calling the decorated function triggers a warning message generated with function name, version, and optional replacement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior present. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments. The code solely defines a standard deprecation decorator.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typical Python decorator to mark functions as deprecated. It uses standard library modules (`warnings`, `functools`) and follows common patterns. No external inputs are processed in an insecure manner. The warning message is constructed from fixed parameters, and no data leakage or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a deprecation decorator without any malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for notifying users about deprecated functions.",
