  "purpose": "Define a decorator to mark functions as deprecated with optional replacement guidance.",
  "sources": "The function `deprecated` and its inner `wrapper` function, which may emit warnings.",
  "sinks": "The `warnings.warn` call, which issues a deprecation warning.",
  "flows": "Calls to `deprecated` lead to the execution of `warnings.warn` when deprecated functions are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Python features and warning mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a deprecation decorator that issues a warning when a decorated function is called. It uses standard warnings and functools.wraps to preserve function metadata. No hardcoded credentials, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious code appears; the code's purpose is straightforward. It is a typical utility for API deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
