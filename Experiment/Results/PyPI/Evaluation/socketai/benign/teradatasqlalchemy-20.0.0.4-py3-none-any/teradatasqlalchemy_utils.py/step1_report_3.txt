{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for marking functions as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it only defines a decorator function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, network, or files. It issues warnings via the warnings module but does not leak or transmit data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The decorator only issues warnings internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python features for deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a deprecation decorator that, when applied to a function, will warn users that the function is deprecated and suggest a replacement. It uses standard Python warnings, wraps the original function properly, and uses functools.wraps to preserve metadata. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. Overall, it is safe and typical for Python codebases.",
