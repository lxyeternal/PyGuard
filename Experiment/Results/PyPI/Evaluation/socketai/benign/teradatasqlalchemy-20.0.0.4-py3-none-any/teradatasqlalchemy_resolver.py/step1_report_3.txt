  "purpose": "Type resolution and instantiation for Teradata database data types, mimicking SQLAlchemy's visitor pattern.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'type_' objects and keyword arguments ('**kw') used in method calls.",
  "sinks": "Return statements instantiate type objects with attributes set from 'kw'; no direct data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'type_' and 'kw' data flow into various 'visit_' methods, resulting in object instantiations with specific attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses dynamic method calls but within a safe, controlled pattern. No external network calls or data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with multiple methods for resolving various Teradata data types based on a visitor pattern. Methods dynamically call type constructors with attributes derived from input keyword arguments. The pattern is consistent and predictable, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious side effects. No external or system interactions are present. All type instantiations appear to be for legitimate data type resolution purposes. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate type resolver for Teradata data types, implementing a visitor pattern to instantiate types with provided attributes. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
