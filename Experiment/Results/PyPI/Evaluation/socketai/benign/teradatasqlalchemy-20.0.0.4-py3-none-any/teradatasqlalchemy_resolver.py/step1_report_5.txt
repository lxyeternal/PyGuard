  "purpose": "Type resolver for Teradata data types, dynamically instantiating type objects with attributes based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (type objects, keyword arguments such as 'prec', 'scale', 'length', 'fmt', 'typecode', etc.).",
  "sinks": "Return statements creating instances of type_ with specified attributes; no external data outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate and configure type objects; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No unusual or obfuscated code features; the code is straightforward type resolution logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a visitor pattern for mapping type descriptors to specific type instances with appropriate attributes. It uses method dispatch based on type names, handling various data types and intervals, with attribute assignment based on input parameters. No external data access, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be standard, legitimate utility code for type resolution, without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type resolver for database types, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage. It functions solely as a utility to instantiate type objects based on provided parameters.",
