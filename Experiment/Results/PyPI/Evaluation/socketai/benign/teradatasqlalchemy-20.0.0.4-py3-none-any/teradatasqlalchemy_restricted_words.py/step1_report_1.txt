{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of restricted words likely used to filter or identify SQL or database-related keywords in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The set 'restricted_words' is initialized with hardcoded string literals within the source code.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; the code solely defines a data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources or untrusted input into sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The list is extensive but static, and contains common SQL and database terms, possibly for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a static set initialization of restricted words related to SQL and database operations, likely used for filtering or validation. There are no functions, input handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure and content are typical for a keyword filter and do not suggest malicious intent. The large list and the nature of terms do not indicate obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static list of restricted SQL/database-related keywords. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The purpose seems to be filtering or validation in a larger system, with no suspicious or harmful activity detected.",
