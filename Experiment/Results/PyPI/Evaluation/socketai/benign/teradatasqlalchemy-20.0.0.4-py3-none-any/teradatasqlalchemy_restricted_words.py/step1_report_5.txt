  "purpose": "Define a set of restricted words likely used for filtering or validation purposes in a database or query context.",
  "sources": "The code reads the static set 'restricted_words' defined at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No data is being processed or output in this code snippet; it only defines a data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input to output flow exists; the code only initializes a set variable.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a static set of words; no signs of unusual behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static set of strings labeled 'restricted_words', likely for filtering or validation purposes. No input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a configuration or constants module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data structure definition used for filtering or validation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
