  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a static initialization of a set called `restricted_words`, containing a large number of SQL and database-related keywords.\n- No functions, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The purpose appears to be filtering or validation, likely in a security context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct. The set is properly initialized with string literals. No issues or errors are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** The code itself poses no security risk; it’s a static list.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is a list of SQL/database keywords, used for filtering/validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static set, no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The confidence level is high.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static list, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same purpose; static list for filtering/validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but since the code is benign, this should be lower. The list could be used to filter malicious queries, but the code itself is not risky.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 or very close to zero. The small value (0.2) overstates the risk.\n- **Verdict:** Adjust to 0.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static list, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The malware score should remain at 0 since no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The security risk score should be 0, as the code is purely static data with no active security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**             | No malicious code or payloads detected.                      |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**             | Code is straightforward, static list.                        |\n| **Security Risk** | **0**             | No active vulnerabilities or risks; static data.            |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign static list used for filtering or validation.\n- The reports correctly identify no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The only adjustment needed is reducing the `securityRisk` score in report 4 from 0.2 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set all security risk scores to 0, including report 4.\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code accurately.",
