{
  "purpose": "Define a set of restricted words likely used for filtering or validation purposes within a larger application, potentially related to SQL or database interactions.",
  "sources": "The set 'restricted_words' is a static variable initialized with numerous string literals; no external input or data sources are accessed or read.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks, network connections, or system calls in this code segment.",
  "flows": "The code simply initializes a set; there are no data flows, transformations, or data propagation pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a large static set of strings, possibly used for filtering or validation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious dynamic execution, or hidden behavior are present. The set includes numerous SQL and database-related terms, but this appears to be a list for validation or filtering rather than malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining a Python set named 'restricted_words' containing many strings, mainly related to SQL, database operations, and security-related terms. There are no external inputs, no functions, no dynamic code, and no network or system interactions. The purpose seems to be establishing a list of words to restrict or validate against, likely for security or filtering purposes. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code does not include any obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static list of strings used for validation or filtering in a larger context. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, safe configuration or validation list.",
