{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a set of restricted words, likely used for filtering or validation purposes in SQL or database interactions.",
  "sources": "The data source is the hard-coded set 'restricted_words' defined at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be the usage of 'restricted_words' in filtering logic elsewhere; no direct sinks are visible in this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows within this code snippet; the set may be used elsewhere to compare against user input or queries.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large, extensive list of SQL and database-related keywords and identifiers, which could be used for filtering malicious or dangerous SQL. No suspicious code structures or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious instructions are present. No code injection, data leakage, or external network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a comprehensive set of keywords related to SQL and database operations, possibly for use in input validation or filtering to prevent SQL injection or malicious queries. The list is static and hardcoded, which is common in filtering mechanisms. No other code logic, functions, or external interactions are present that could indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. Overall, the code's purpose seems benign and intended for security filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static list of restricted SQL/database keywords, likely used for filtering or validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a benign component of a security mechanism.",
