{
  "purpose": "A static set of SQL and database-related keywords, likely used for filtering or validation to prevent injection or misuse.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a predefined set of strings assigned to 'restricted_words'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the set is static and used as a reference.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, hardcoded set of SQL/database keywords. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or malicious code. The only minor inconsistency is the security risk score in one report (0.2), which should be lowered to 0 given the static, non-malicious nature of the list. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. All evidence points to a benign, purpose-driven list used for filtering or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list of SQL/database keywords with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is used for validation purposes and poses no threat. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
