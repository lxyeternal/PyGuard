  "purpose": "Define a set of restricted words likely used for filtering or validation in database or query contexts.",
  "sources": "The entire code is a single assignment statement defining a set named 'restricted_words'. No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or processing functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely initializes a static set variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscation or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static set definition containing a comprehensive list of SQL and database-related keywords. It appears to serve as a blacklist or filter list for validation or security purposes. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, no network calls, and no code manipulations. The structure and content suggest an intent for filtering or validation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely defining a list of restricted words likely for query validation or filtering purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
