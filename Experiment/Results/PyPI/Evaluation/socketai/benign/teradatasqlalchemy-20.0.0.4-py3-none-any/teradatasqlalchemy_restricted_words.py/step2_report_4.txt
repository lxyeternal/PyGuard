  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static set of strings representing SQL and database-related keywords.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or network activity are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- The purpose appears to be filtering or validation, which is a common security practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- The code matches the description: a static initialization of a set named `restricted_words`.\n- The list is extensive but static, containing common SQL and database terms.\n- No evidence of code that reads untrusted input, writes to external systems, or performs any malicious activity.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident. The code is straightforward.\n- The only minor point: the large size of the list might impact maintainability or performance if used improperly, but this is outside the scope of security analysis.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0 or very close to 0\n- These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a high risk score. The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a static list, likely used for filtering.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based solely on this code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no security risk in static list definition)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, intended for filtering, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, static list of SQL/database keywords used for validation or filtering. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
