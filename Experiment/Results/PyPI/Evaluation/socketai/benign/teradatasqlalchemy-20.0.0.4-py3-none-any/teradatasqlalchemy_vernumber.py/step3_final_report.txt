  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable for version tracking within the code.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned directly to 'sVersionNumber'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code is static and does not process external input.",
  "flows": "The source is the static assignment; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with a comment indicating copyright. It contains no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behavior. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is trivial and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
