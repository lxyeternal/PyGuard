  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a simple assignment; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright notice comment, a version string variable assignment, and a comment line. There are no input sources, data processing, or untrusted data handling. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The version number appears standard and hardcoded, with no sensitive information or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of a version string assignment with a copyright comment. It presents no security risks, malicious behavior, or anomalies.",
