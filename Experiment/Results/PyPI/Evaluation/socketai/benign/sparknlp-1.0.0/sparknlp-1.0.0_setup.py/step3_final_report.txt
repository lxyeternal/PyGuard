  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long_description; static metadata and dependencies defined within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used throughout",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read and hardcoded parameters into setup() configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-formed setup script with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script. It imports standard modules, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or obfuscated code. The parameters are static and follow best practices for packaging. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The script's purpose is solely to package the project with specified metadata and dependencies, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and safe. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1, reflecting its role as a configuration file. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
