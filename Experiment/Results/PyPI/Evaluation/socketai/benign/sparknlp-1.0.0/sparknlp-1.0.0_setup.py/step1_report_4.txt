{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static package metadata definitions, and dependencies listed in REQUIRED_PKGS.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data sinks; no code executes based on external input.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static data to define package metadata; no source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted data exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is standard setup boilerplate, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setuptools configuration script. It reads a README file for description, defines package dependencies, and specifies package metadata. No user input or external data influences execution. The only file read is the README.md, which is a static file likely provided by the package author. The setup() call contains hardcoded strings for package name, version, description, and other metadata. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The overall structure aligns with common packaging practices and does not contain any malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
