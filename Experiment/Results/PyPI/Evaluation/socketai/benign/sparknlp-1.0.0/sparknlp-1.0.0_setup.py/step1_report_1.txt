  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging and distribution parameters for the 'sparknlp' Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications are made in this script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README.md file into the 'long_description' variable, then into setup(). No external or untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard setuptools functions and imports. 'include_package_data' is set to False, which is normal for package data control.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports well-known modules, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with typical metadata. All variables and parameters appear standard and appropriate. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code does not perform any runtime operations beyond configuration. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external data sources involved.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a benign configuration file for packaging the 'sparknlp' library. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, standard, and safe.",
