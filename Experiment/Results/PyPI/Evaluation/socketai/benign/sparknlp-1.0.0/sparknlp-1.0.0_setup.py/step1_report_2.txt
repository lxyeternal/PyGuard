  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'sparknlp' via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file write, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are static strings and lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code consists of standard setup configurations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with project metadata. All parameters are hardcoded or derived from local files. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
