{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to package and distribute a Python project called 'sparknlp' with dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static package configuration data; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; no dynamic code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging libraries and reads a README file to set the long_description. It defines dependencies and project metadata statically, with no dynamic or external input manipulation. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behavior observed. The setup configuration is straightforward and typical for Python packages. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
