  "purpose": "This script processes ONNX model files, loads them, optionally infers shape information, renames unnamed nodes, and saves the modified model.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files from a specified file path using onnx.load.",
  "sinks": "Saves the processed ONNX model to a specified output file path using onnx.save.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> onnx.load -> convert with gs.import_onnx -> process graph -> onnx.shape_inference.infer_shapes -> onnx.save",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of insecure environment variables; no suspicious code injection; no obfuscated code. Uses standard library functions and well-known packages.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads an ONNX model, performs cleanup and topology sort operations on the graph, auto-assigns names to unnamed nodes, attempts shape inference, and then saves the processed model. It includes command-line argument parsing for file paths and verbosity. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious system modification activities are present. The code structure appears standard for a model processing utility, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate ONNX model processing tool without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations such as loading, processing, and saving models, with no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe for use.",
