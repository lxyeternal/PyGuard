{
  "purpose": "The script loads an ONNX model (from file or object), cleans up the graph, auto-supplements missing operation names, performs shape inference, and saves the processed model. It also provides a command-line interface for file paths and verbosity control.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX file from disk or receives an in-memory onnx.ModelProto object.",
  "sinks": "Writes the processed ONNX model to disk; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Loads model -> cleans up and sorts graph -> auto-supplements node names -> attempts shape inference -> saves model to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ONNX model processing tasks: loading, cleanup, node renaming, shape inference, and saving. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution is present. Error handling via sys.exit is typical. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. The code is consistent with benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard ONNX model processing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1, reflecting minimal operational risk.",
