{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to load, process, modify, and optionally save ONNX machine learning models, including cleanup, shape inference, and node name supplementation.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model files from filesystem via onnx.load() and file paths provided as command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed ONNX models back to filesystem using onnx.save(). No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> onnx.load() -> model processing (including shape inference and node naming) -> onnx.save() -> output file.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious code patterns; it performs standard model processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code loads an ONNX model from a specified file path, performs cleanup, toposorting, and automatically assigns names to unnamed nodes. It attempts to perform shape inference, catching exceptions and issuing warnings if shape inference fails. The processed model is saved to a specified output path. All operations are typical for ONNX model processing scripts. No external network connections, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard ONNX model processing utility with no malicious intent. It safely handles model files for cleanup, naming, and shape inference. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
