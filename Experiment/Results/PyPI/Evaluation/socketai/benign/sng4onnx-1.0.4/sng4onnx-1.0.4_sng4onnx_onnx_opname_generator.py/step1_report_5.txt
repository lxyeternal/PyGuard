  "purpose": "This script processes ONNX models by importing, cleaning, inferring shapes, and saving them, with optional verbosity controls.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX file path from command-line arguments; loads ONNX model using onnx.load; processes model in generate() function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to console; saves processed ONNX model to specified output path.",
  "flows": "Reads ONNX file -> loads into onnx.ModelProto -> imports into onnx_graphsurgeon -> processes and optionally infers shapes -> saves processed model.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network connections, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious dynamic code execution; standard library usage only.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward ONNX model processing tool that loads a model, cleans, sorts, and optionally infers shapes before saving. It includes basic error handling and logging. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns, no external network activity, and no evident malicious logic. The only potential concern is the lack of input validation for file paths, but this does not constitute malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for processing ONNX models with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
