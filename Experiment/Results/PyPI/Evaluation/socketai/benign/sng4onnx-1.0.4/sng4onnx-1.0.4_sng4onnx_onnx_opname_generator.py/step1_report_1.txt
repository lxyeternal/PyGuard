{
  "purpose": "The script loads an ONNX model, processes it using onnx_graphsurgeon, optionally infers shapes, and saves the processed model.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX model file specified by 'input_onnx_file_path'.",
  "sinks": "Writes the processed ONNX model file to 'output_onnx_file_path'.",
  "flows": "Loads ONNX model -> processes and cleans graph -> optionally infers shapes -> saves the graph.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; use of standard libraries; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as an ONNX model processing utility, with input/output file handling and shape inference. It performs standard graph manipulations via onnx_graphsurgeon, with no dynamic code execution or network activities. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The import statements and functions are consistent with legitimate ONNX model processing workflows. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs. No obfuscation is detected. All actions relate to standard file processing and graph modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard ONNX model processing utility without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file I/O, graph cleanup, shape inference, and optional logging, all within typical usage patterns. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
