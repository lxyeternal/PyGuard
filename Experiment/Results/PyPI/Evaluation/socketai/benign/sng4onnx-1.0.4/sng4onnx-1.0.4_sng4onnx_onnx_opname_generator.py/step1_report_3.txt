{
  "purpose": "The script processes ONNX models by loading, potentially renaming nodes, cleaning up, sorting, and inferring shapes, then saving the modified model.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX file path via command-line argument and loads the ONNX model from disk using onnx.load().",
  "sinks": "Saves the processed ONNX model to disk with onnx.save(). Does not handle untrusted data directly beyond file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> onnx.load() -> Graph processing via onnx_graphsurgeon -> Exported back to ONNX -> Shape inference -> Save to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.exit(1) upon missing input parameters; no other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ONNX model processing steps: loading, node renaming, cleanup, toposort, shape inference, and saving. No code injection, malicious data leakage, or backdoors are evident. It does use print statements for logs, which are normal for scripts. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or hidden behaviors are present. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for model processing scripts. The only potential concern is the use of sys.exit for input validation, which is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign ONNX model processing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical patterns for model manipulation without any suspicious or harmful code segments.",
