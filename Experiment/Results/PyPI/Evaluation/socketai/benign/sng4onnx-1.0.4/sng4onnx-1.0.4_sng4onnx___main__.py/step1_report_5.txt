{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple entry point script that imports a module named 'main' and executes its main function when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import main' which loads the 'main' module relative to this script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not process any untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' and then calls 'main()' if executed as the main module, establishing a straightforward flow from import to execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The code is minimal and standard for a Python entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal entry point that imports a local 'main' module and executes its 'main()' function if run directly. There are no suspicious operations, no hardcoded secrets, no data flows involving untrusted sources, and no indications of malicious intent. The simplicity suggests it's a boilerplate pattern for Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply delegates execution to the 'main' function of a local module. No security risks are identified.",
