{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a standard Python entry point that imports a local 'main' module and executes its 'main()' function when run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from the local package and the execution trigger in the '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code only calls 'main()' from the imported module.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import statement to the '__main__' check, then to the call to 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a typical, straightforward entry point pattern with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, importing a local 'main' module and executing its 'main()' function if run as the main script. It contains no data inputs, network calls, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'main', which is not provided, but the snippet itself shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it is benign. The scores assigned in the critical reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Python entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
