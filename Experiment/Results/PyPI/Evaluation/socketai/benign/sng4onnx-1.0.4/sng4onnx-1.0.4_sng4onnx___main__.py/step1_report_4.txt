{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports the 'main' module and executes its main function when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable to determine if it is the main module execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The source (__name__) triggers the execution of main() if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a Python script entry point; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package and calls its main() function if the script is executed as the main program. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a typical entry point for a Python application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python entry point script with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
