{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to run a main function from a local module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes main() if run directly, which could lead to any actions defined within main.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from the import of 'main' to calling main() upon script execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module named 'main'. When executed directly, it calls the main() function from that module. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code relies on the behavior of the imported 'main' module; without inspecting 'main', potential malicious actions could originate there, but within this snippet, there's no direct malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests typical script entry point pattern, with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script entry point that delegates execution to a main() function in a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior in this fragment. Any malicious activity would depend on the implementation of the 'main' module, which is not provided.",
