{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from an external module and sets a version string, likely for module initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator', no input reading or data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no data leaks, no network or output operations.",
  "flows": "Import of functions 'generate' and 'main' from external module; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; minimal and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a standard import and version assignment, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious activity, with malware scores at 0 and low risk scores (~0.1) justified by dependency trust considerations. The code's simplicity and lack of data flows or obfuscation support a benign assessment. The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of the external module, which cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal, straightforward nature of the code. No further action is necessary based solely on this fragment.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
