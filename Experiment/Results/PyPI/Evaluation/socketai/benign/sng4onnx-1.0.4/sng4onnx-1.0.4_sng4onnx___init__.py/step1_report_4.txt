{
  "purpose": "Import functions generate and main from the sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator module, likely for generating or processing ONNX operation names.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the external package sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as no untrusted data handling, output, or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and sets a version string with no execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward, only importing and defining a version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a specific module, which suggests it depends on external library functionality. The version string indicates the package version. There is no evidence of data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code snippet is minimal and appears to be part of a larger project. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a version declaration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for a Python package or script.",
