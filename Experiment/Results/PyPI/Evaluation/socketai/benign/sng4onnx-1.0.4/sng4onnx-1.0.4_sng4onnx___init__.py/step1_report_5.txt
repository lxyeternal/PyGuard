  "purpose": "Import functions generate and main from the sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator module, likely for generating or processing ONNX operation names.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the module sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no functions that execute untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flows present in this snippet, as it only contains import and version declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a module and sets a version string. It does not include data input, output, or any runtime behavior. There are no evident malicious actions, code execution, or unusual patterns. The minimal nature of the snippet suggests it is likely a library or module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import with a version identifier. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected based on this limited snippet.",
