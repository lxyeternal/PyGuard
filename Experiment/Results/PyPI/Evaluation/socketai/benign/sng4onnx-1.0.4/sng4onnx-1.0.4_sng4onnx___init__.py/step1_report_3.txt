{
  "purpose": "Import functions 'generate' and 'main' from the 'sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator' module; set version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, network, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; code only imports functions and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and variable assignment, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a third-party module and sets a version variable. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution flows that could be exploited. The module name 'sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator' suggests a functionality related to ONNX operations, but the code provided is minimal and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a standard import and version declaration with no embedded malicious intent.",
