{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions from a module related to ONNX operation name generation, likely for model processing or conversion tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'sng4onnx.onnx_opname_generator', which loads functions into the current namespace.",
  "sinks": "None present in this code snippet; no data output or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet; no source-to-sink paths are established.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, but the import statement does not reveal any suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions 'generate' and 'main' from a specific module and defines a version string. It appears to be a typical module import with no signs of malicious activity. The module name suggests it may generate or handle ONNX operation names, but no malicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment alone. The version string indicates package versioning, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this very limited snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
