{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sng4onnx', including package metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__init__.py' in the package to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that execute untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading files to extracting package metadata, culminating in setup configuration; no data flows into untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The email address appears publicly known and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading documentation and version info, defining package parameters, and setting up console entry points. All file reads are for metadata, with no user input or untrusted data involved. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and entry points for distribution.",
