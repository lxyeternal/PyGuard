{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python module, configuring metadata, reading description and version info, and defining entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads '__init__.py' to extract '__version__' via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network communication; only local file reads.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> extracts version -> passes metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with safe file reads and regex parsing. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex for version extraction is simple and safe. No hardcoded secrets or external commands are used. The code follows best practices for packaging. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
