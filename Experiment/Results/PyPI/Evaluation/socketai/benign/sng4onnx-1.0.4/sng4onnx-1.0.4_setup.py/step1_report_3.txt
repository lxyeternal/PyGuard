{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'sng4onnx'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; reading __init__.py to extract __version__.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations such as code execution or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (README.md and __init__.py) to package metadata fields; no external data flow or untrusted input processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable usage observed. The use of regex is straightforward for version extraction.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files for package description and version, configuring package metadata, and defining console entry points. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. All operations are typical for a Python setup script, and no external or untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause harm.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads local files for package metadata and sets up packaging parameters.",
