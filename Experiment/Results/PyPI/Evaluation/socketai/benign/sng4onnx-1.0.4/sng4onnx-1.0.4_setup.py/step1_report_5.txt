{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'sng4onnx', including metadata, package discovery, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads '__init__.py' in the package directory to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute code dynamically based on external input.",
  "flows": "Reads files to obtain package description and version, then passes this information to the setup() function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. Uses standard setup procedures without dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging modules (setuptools, os, re) to read files and extract metadata. It reads a README file for description and a package's '__init__.py' to extract the version number via regex. No user input, network communication, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears to follow common packaging practices without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected.",
