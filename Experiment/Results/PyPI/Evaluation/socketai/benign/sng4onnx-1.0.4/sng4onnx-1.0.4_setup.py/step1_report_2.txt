  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sng4onnx' Python package, defining package metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__init__.py' for version extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no execution of external commands or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Read from files (README.md, __init__.py) to variables; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files, extracting version info via regex, and configuring package metadata. No code executes beyond file I/O and data assignment. No network activity, command execution, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard packaging procedures and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
