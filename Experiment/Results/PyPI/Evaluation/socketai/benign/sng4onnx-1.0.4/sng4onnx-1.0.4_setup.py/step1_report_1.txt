  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'sng4onnx' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads '__init__.py' for version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external network or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Reads files for metadata and version, then passes data into setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading description and version info, configuring package metadata, and defining console entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The use of regular expressions to parse version info is safe here, given the context. All operations are related to packaging; no embedded malicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
