  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script performs standard setup tasks; no suspicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a typical setup script with no malicious indicators. The confidence is high.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard operations, no external data flow, no suspicious patterns. Slightly higher securityRisk=0.1, but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score might be overestimating, given no suspicious activity. The reasoning remains consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Justified; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard packaging code, no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external communication.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard package setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code only reads local files and sets up package metadata.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The use of regex to extract version info is safe here; no obfuscation or malicious pattern.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The code is a typical Python setup script.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** **0**  \n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present in this setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
