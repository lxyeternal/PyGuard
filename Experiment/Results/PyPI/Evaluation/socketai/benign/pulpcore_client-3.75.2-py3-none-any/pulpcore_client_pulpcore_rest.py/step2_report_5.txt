  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a Python REST API client with SSL and proxy support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that data flows into network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, proxy URL validation straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code is a standard, secure HTTP client. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, and the security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the network capabilities, but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code as an HTTP client with proxy and SSL support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes data flow from configuration and parameters into network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Proxy handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is solid. The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk score of 0.2 aligns with the potential for misconfiguration but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a REST client with proxy and SSL support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from inputs into network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Proxy URL validation is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning holds. Malware score of 0 is correct. Security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, considering the network capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code as a custom REST client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Proxy handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; benign code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. Malware score of 0 is justified. Security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the network features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a configurable HTTP client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from configuration and parameters into network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Proxy URL validation is basic but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-supported.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis — no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting potential misconfigurations but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports and code analysis)\n\n**Note:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented HTTP client supporting SSL and proxies, including SOCKS proxies. No evidence suggests malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The scores are appropriate given the code's functionality and the absence of malicious indicators. No changes needed.",
