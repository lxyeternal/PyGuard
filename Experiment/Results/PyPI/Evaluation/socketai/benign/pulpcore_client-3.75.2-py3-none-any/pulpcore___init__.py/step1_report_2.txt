{
  "purpose": "The code extends the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __path__ and __name__ to modify the module's resource search path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses __path__ and __name__ with extend_path, which is a common pattern for namespace packages; no malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and reassigns __path__ by extending it with the current __path__ and __name__, a standard practice for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious actions. The pattern is consistent with normal package resource extension, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a typical namespace package pattern with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is standard and safe.",
