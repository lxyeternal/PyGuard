{
  "purpose": "To extend the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil's extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existing __path__ variable and the module's __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code takes __path__ and __name__, and updates __path__ with extended paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for package resource management; no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and uses it to extend the module's __path__, a common practice for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform operations that could be malicious. It appears to be boilerplate code for handling package resources, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for namespace package support and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to extend the module path for package resource discovery.",
