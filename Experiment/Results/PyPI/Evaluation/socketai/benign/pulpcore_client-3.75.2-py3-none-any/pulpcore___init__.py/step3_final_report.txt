  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ to include additional directories for resource discovery.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil and assignment to __path__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network activity, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "extend_path(__path__, __name__) modifies __path__ to include additional package directories.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a minimal, standard pattern with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and assigns its result to __path__, enabling namespace package support. It is a well-known, benign pattern used in Python packages. No data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with best practices for namespace packages. No anomalies or suspicious logic are detected. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
