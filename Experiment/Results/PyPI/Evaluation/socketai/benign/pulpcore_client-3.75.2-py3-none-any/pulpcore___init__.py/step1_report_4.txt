{
  "purpose": "The code extends the module's __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path, likely for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ and __name__ variables, which are intrinsic to the module's import context.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed or written.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the module's __path__ to extend it with additional paths, which is standard for namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code performs a standard namespace extension.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing extend_path from pkgutil and extending __path__ for namespace package functionality. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual logic. It adheres to common patterns used in Python namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply enables namespace package support by extending __path__.",
