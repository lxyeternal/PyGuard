  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code in question is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python namespace packages.\n- All reports consistently describe the purpose as extending the module's search path using `pkgutil.extend_path`.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code pattern is well-known and accepted in Python packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.\n- No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are not present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the scores and reasoning:\n\n**Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n\n**Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Risk score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Since the code is standard and benign, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Security risk:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Scores to consider:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a standard pattern used in Python namespace packages.\n- Assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n- The code's purpose and behavior are benign and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard namespace package pattern.\n- No issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- Scores should all be zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
