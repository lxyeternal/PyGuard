  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "Uses the __path__ variable and the __name__ attribute to extend the package's search path",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code merely modifies the module path",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard use of pkgutil.extend_path",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil, then extends the __path__ variable for the current module/package with extend_path(__path__, __name__). This is a typical pattern for namespace packages or for extending package directories dynamically. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks for data leaks, and no abnormal code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern used in namespace package setups or dynamic package extensions, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
