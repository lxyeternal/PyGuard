{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to modify the module's __path__ attribute to include additional locations for module resources, typically used for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the __name__ variable, which are standard module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply extends the module's __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The use of extend_path from pkgutil is normal in namespace packages; no unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and reassigns __path__ using extend_path, which is a common pattern for namespace package support. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and follows standard practices for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
