  "purpose": "Extend module search path for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "Import of pkgutil.extend_path and use of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; straightforward extension of __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and reassigns __path__ using extend_path(__path__, __name__). This pattern is a common, benign practice in Python to support namespace packages or modular extensions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern used in Python namespace packages with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
