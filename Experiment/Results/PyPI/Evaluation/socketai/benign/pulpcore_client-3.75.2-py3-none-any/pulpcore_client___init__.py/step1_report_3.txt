{
  "purpose": "The code extends the module's search path using pkgutil.extend_path, typically for package namespace management.",
  "sources": "Reads the existing __path__ variable and the module name __name__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "The source (__path__ and __name__) are passed to extend_path to modify __path__, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil, then modifies the __path__ variable to include additional paths for namespace package support. It follows typical patterns for Python namespace packages. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external communications. The code is concise and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for namespace package setup, with no malicious or security risk indications.",
