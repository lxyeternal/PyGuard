{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module search path using pkgutil's extend_path, likely for modular or namespace package purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable, which is a module attribute that indicates the module's search path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data is used or where data could leak.",
  "flows": "The flow involves extending the module's __path__ attribute, which is a standard operation for namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions without any obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and modifies the __path__ variable to include additional locations for module lookup. This is typical for namespace packages or modular extensions. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data sources, or suspicious operations. The code is simple and adheres to common Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for extending a package's search path and contains no malicious behavior. No security risks are evident.",
