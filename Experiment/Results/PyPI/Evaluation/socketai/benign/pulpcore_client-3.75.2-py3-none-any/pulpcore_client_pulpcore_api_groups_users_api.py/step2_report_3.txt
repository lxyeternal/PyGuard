  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes an auto-generated API client for managing group users.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls via 'call_api' and response deserialization, data flows from parameters into request, then to network.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code is standard for an auto-generated client.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard, safe. Confidence: 1. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a typical auto-generated API client with no malicious intent. The logic is sound, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, describing an API client for group user management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request serialization, then network call.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. Standard code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no malicious behavior. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is standard, with no suspicious data leaks or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same context, managing group users.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request construction and network call.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no malicious signals. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly identified as benign, standard API client code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for group users.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Serialization into requests, network call, response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, typical code. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API wrapper for group user management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request serialization, network call, response deserialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard pattern. Confidence: 0.95. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as an auto-generated API client with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None observed; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores & Justification:**  \n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static analysis.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n  - **Risk Score:** All are low, reflecting no security risks detected.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, auto-generated, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified; the code is a standard API client.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, auto-generated API client for managing group users, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and align with the static code review findings.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or specific security considerations.",
