  "purpose": "API client for managing group users via REST API, auto-generated by OpenAPI.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as group_href, group_user, groups_user_href, and request headers/params.",
  "sinks": "Network API calls via api_client.call_api, response deserialization, and response handling.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into request serialization, then into network requests, with responses deserialized into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated API client with typical request serialization, network calls, and response processing. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are straightforward, and no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or code injection are observed. The code adheres to common patterns for API clients, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API client for group user management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
