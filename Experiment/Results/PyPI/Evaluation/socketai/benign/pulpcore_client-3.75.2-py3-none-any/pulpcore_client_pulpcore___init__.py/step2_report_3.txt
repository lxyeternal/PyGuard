  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe this code as auto-generated SDK boilerplate consisting solely of import statements, comments, and version info.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or runtime behavior is present.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows involving user input or external data are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is consistent with typical SDK setup files, intended for API interaction.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely static, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious features.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as expected, given the straightforward import statements.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only possible concern could be if the imported modules themselves are malicious. However, since these are standard SDK modules generated from an API specification, and no runtime code or data handling occurs here, this is unlikely.\n- The import statements are extensive but typical for SDK setup, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code appears to be safe, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and typical for SDK setup, with no malicious or suspicious features.",
