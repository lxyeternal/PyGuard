  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as auto-generated SDK setup code, mainly import statements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or output; purely static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report's conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—SDK setup, static imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flows or outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious features.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard auto-generated SDK code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the evaluation aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK import setup, no data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static import statements, no data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical auto-generated SDK code, safe and non-malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK import statements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK setup, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 0, fitting the code.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK import statements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical auto-generated SDK code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify this as auto-generated SDK boilerplate code, consisting solely of import statements and comments.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n- **Security Risk:** Appropriately low, given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely static, auto-generated SDK setup code.\n- No data flows, no runtime logic, no network or file operations.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The import statements are standard for SDKs and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted.",
