  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Malware:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is purely import statements and metadata, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n   - The code is described as auto-generated SDK boilerplate, which is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected across all reports.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws:**\n   - The code is static, consisting solely of import statements, with no runtime logic, user input, or data processing.\n   - The sources are from well-known SDK modules, and no secrets or sensitive data are hardcoded.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies:**\n   - All reports note the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code's purpose is clear: setting up SDK imports for API interaction.\n   - **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n\n4. **Scores Consistency and Justification:**\n   - Given the detailed analysis, all scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriately set at 0.\n   - The high confidence (1) is justified due to the clear, consistent nature of the code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risks identified)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe for use and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is benign, purely static import statements for SDK setup.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure the SDK dependencies are from trusted sources and verify their integrity when deploying in sensitive environments.",
