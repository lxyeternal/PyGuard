  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes SDK setup via imports, no untrusted data processed.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard auto-generated SDK code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely import statements for SDK components, with no executable logic or data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Given the absence of executable code, data processing, or network activity, the risk is negligible.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is auto-generated SDK setup with no malicious intent.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: static import statements, no runtime logic.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is a static SDK setup with no executable logic.\n- No data flows involving untrusted input.\n- No anomalies or suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion: purely import statements, no runtime code or data processing.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code or behavior present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK setup with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there is no executable logic, no data handling, and no malicious indicators, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely static import statements for a generated SDK, which is standard practice and does not pose security risks.\n- No data flows, no dynamic code, no secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscation are present.\n- The consistent findings across all reports support a low to zero risk conclusion.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard SDK setup code with no malicious or suspicious features detected.",
