  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model for serializing/deserializing HTTP responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; static data model with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output effects.",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative data schema.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect placement of 'model_config' as a class attribute instead of a nested 'Config' class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward, generic API response model with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. The 'model_config' is misimplemented; it should be a nested 'Config' class for Pydantic to recognize configuration options. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' allows flexible data typing but does not pose an immediate security risk in this static context. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The misconfiguration is a minor correctness issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model with a minor implementation mistake in configuration setup. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is the incorrect 'model_config' placement, which should be corrected for proper Pydantic behavior but does not impact security. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
