{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for serialization and validation using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input data reading; the code primarily defines a class structure.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static data model without runtime data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a generic class 'ApiResponse' with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It utilizes Pydantic's BaseModel for data validation. The configuration allows arbitrary types, which is standard for flexible data models. No external input handling, no dynamic execution, no suspicious code segments or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data model definition for API responses with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any data processing or network activity that could be exploited maliciously.",
