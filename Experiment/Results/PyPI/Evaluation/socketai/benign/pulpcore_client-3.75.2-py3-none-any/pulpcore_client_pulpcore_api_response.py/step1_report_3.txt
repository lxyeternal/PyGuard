{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model using Pydantic for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (__future__, typing, pydantic), class attribute definitions, and data fields within ApiResponse.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input directly or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks is present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The model_config dictionary is defined but not assigned to the class as a class attribute; it should be 'Config' class inside ApiResponse to be effective. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Pydantic model for API responses, specifying types and descriptions. It uses type variables for generic data handling. The model_config dictionary is intended to configure Pydantic settings but is not correctly implemented as it should be a nested class 'Config'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and standard for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model definition with a minor implementation issue in the configuration setup. There are no malicious behaviors, malware, or security risks identified.",
