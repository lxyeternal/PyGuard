  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; data is provided via the data and raw_data fields, which could be populated from external API responses.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling beyond data storage.",
  "flows": "Input data from external API responses populates data and raw_data fields; no external influence detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model configuration is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data model using Pydantic, with fields for status code, headers, deserialized data, and raw bytes of response. It employs type hints and optional fields appropriately. The configuration allows arbitrary types, which could be a risk if untrusted data is assigned, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, well-structured API response model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as a data container for API responses.",
