{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model for serializing and deserializing HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources directly.",
  "targets": "None; the code does not send untrusted data to external systems or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, utilizing pydantic models and type annotations without any suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a generic class ApiResponse using pydantic for data validation. It specifies fields for status code, headers, data, and raw response data with appropriate types. The model_config allows arbitrary types, which is common in flexible data models. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No external data is read or sent, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured data model for API responses with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
