{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for structured handling of HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a data class and imports libraries; it does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or operations that process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code snippet as it is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a generic data class 'ApiResponse' using pydantic for validation, and specifies fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. The model configuration allows arbitrary types, which is standard for flexible data handling. There are no dynamic evaluations, code injections, or external input processing within this snippet. The code solely serves as a schema/model definition without executing any malicious or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data model definition with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical use of pydantic for API response modeling without any suspicious or malicious components.",
