  "purpose": "Define exception classes and utility functions for handling API errors in an OpenAPI-generated client.",
  "sources": "HTTP response objects, error message strings, input parameters for exceptions",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted with response headers, bodies, and paths; exception raising",
  "flows": "Response data flows into error message strings, which are used in exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception classes and a helper function for rendering error paths. It processes HTTP response data to generate detailed error messages. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for API error handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The inclusion of response headers and bodies in error messages is standard for debugging but could be sensitive if logs are exposed; however, this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of API error handling classes and functions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
