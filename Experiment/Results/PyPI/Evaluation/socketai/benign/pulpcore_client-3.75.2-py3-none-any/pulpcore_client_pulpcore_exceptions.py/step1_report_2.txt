{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling API errors and validation in an OpenAPI client.",
  "sources": "No input data reading or external data sources; only exception class definitions and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written to external systems or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily structures exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. The code is standard for API exception handling, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception classes to represent various API error states. It includes detailed constructors that format error messages and capture response data for debugging. The 'render_path' utility constructs a string representation of data paths, aiding in error reporting. The 'from_response' class method maps HTTP status codes to specific exceptions, ensuring precise error categorization. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The implementation appears standard and safe, with a focus on error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API exception handling classes without malicious intent or security issues. It does not process or leak sensitive data and does not contain malicious behaviors or backdoors.",
