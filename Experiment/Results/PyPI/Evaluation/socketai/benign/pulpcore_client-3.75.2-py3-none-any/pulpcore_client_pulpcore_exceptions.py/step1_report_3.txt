{
  "purpose": "The code defines exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI client, including custom error messages and response parsing logic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only processes data passed as arguments and constructs exception messages.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, network, or files; exception messages are generated for internal handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; flow is limited to error message construction and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code adheres to standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to exception management for an API client. It defines various custom exceptions, with methods to include detailed context in error messages. The 'render_path' function constructs string paths for debugging. No external input handling or potentially malicious operations are present. The use of try-except blocks around decoding HTTP response data is standard. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward exception handling logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes and helper functions for an API client. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. It functions solely for error reporting and control flow in an API context.",
