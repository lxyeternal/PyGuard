  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and error handling for an OpenAPI client, facilitating structured error management.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; error information may come from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive error details (headers, body, data) included in exception messages.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows into exception objects which may include response headers and body in error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is standard error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured exception hierarchy for handling API errors, including specific exceptions for HTTP status codes. It processes HTTP response objects, extracting status, reason, headers, and body for error reporting. All data used in exceptions originate from HTTP responses, which is normal for API error handling. No input reading from untrusted sources or external files is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are found, and the code appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical error handling framework for an OpenAPI client with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It solely processes HTTP response data for exception messaging.",
