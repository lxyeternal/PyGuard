  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a set of exception classes and utility functions for handling API errors, generated by OpenAPI tools.\n- No data input/output, network calls, or code execution beyond error message formatting.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- The code is standard for API client error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard exception classes, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes, detailed error messages, response parsing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is marginally increased to 0.1, possibly due to the inclusion of response data in error messages. However, this is standard practice and not inherently risky. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep securityRisk at 0.1; the score seems reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes, error message construction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Error handling, detailed error info from HTTP responses.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious behavior.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes, error reporting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Generally 0 or 0.1. The slight increase in Report 2's securityRisk is justified given that response data is included in error messages, but this does not pose a security threat.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to inclusion of response data in error messages, which is standard but could be slightly sensitive if logs are exposed)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard API error handling code, with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
