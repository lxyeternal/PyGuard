{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling API errors and responses, particularly in an OpenAPI context. It is primarily meant for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data for effects such as executing commands, writing files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only constructs error messages and raises exceptions based on API response objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present. The code performs standard exception handling and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code contains custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, used for handling API-related errors. It includes methods to generate detailed error messages, including headers and response bodies, when exceptions are raised. The render_path function constructs string representations of paths for debugging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or data exfiltration. The structure is typical for error handling modules in API clients. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error handling module for API responses. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply defines classes and functions to facilitate error reporting in API interactions.",
