  "purpose": "Unit tests for the utils module in the analytics package, verifying date, timezone, data cleaning, and string manipulation functions.",
  "sources": "Input data in test cases such as date/time objects, dictionaries, exception objects, and lambda functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; test code primarily operates on internal or controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow through utils functions, but no untrusted data source or external system interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; tests appear standard. Use of lambda functions and exception objects in test data is benign. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests without external data inputs or network interactions. It tests date/time functions, data cleaning, and string utility functions. No evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Usage of internal test data and straightforward assertions indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates on controlled data, and the functions tested are standard and safe.",
