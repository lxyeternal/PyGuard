{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for utility functions in the 'analytics' package, focusing on date/time handling, data cleaning, and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data for tests includes datetime objects, exception objects, timedelta, and function objects; no untrusted external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed; utility functions are used for data cleaning and manipulation.",
  "flows": "Test data flows through 'utils.clean' and other utility functions but remains within the test environment without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard unit test code without hidden or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of utility functions: checking timezone handling, data cleaning, and string manipulation. No external data is processed insecurely; no unsafe code execution, no network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The functions tested are typical and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The 'utils' module is assumed to be a standard utility library, with no signs of malicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and contains no malware or security risks. It is a standard set of unit tests for utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
