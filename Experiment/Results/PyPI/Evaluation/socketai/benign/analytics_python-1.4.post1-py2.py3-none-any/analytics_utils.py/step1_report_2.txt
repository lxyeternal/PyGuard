  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling datetime objects, string normalization, and data cleaning for serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources via function parameters such as host, item, dict_ entries, and complex objects passed to _coerce_unicode.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from functions, particularly after cleaning or coercion, used for further processing or serialization.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the 'clean' and '_clean_dict' functions, potentially passing through '_coerce_unicode', and is returned after processing.",
  "anomalies": "The '_coerce_unicode' function attempts to decode objects using 'decode', which is only valid for byte strings, not for unicode strings or other types. The exception handling converts an AttributeError into a string and then attempts to decode it again, which is unusual and may cause errors. Logging warning in case of decoding errors is benign but somewhat unnecessary. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for datetime timezone guessing, string trimming, and data normalization. It carefully handles various data types, converting Decimal to float and recursively cleaning lists, tuples, and dictionaries. The '_coerce_unicode' function is designed to decode byte strings to unicode but will raise exceptions if used on unicode strings or other non-byte objects, which it handles with a warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are typical utility functions with no network or system modification actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for data normalization and datetime handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the handling in '_coerce_unicode', but it is benign and typical in such utility functions.",
