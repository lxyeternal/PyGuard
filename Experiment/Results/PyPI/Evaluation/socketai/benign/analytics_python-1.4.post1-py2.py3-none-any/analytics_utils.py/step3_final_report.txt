  "purpose": "Utility functions for date/time handling, timezone guessing, string decoding, and data normalization.",
  "sources": "Reading input data in functions like is_naive, guess_timezone, and during recursive data cleaning in _clean_list and _clean_dict.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to external systems; no data exfiltration or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization functions, with potential exception handling in _coerce_unicode, but no external or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Flawed exception handling in _coerce_unicode: attempting to join an exception object, which causes a runtime error, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with straightforward logic. The main concern is in _coerce_unicode, where exception handling is incorrect, leading to potential runtime errors. No network activity, external data transfer, or malicious code is present. The malware score is 0, as there are no indicators of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor bug that could cause runtime exceptions but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with a minor coding bug in exception handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate; the malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk low (~0.2). The primary recommendation is to fix the exception handling in _coerce_unicode to prevent runtime errors.",
