  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling datetime objects, cleaning data structures, and type conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as 'host', 'item', and dictionary values; internal datetime and string processing.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations and logging; no external network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through type checks, conversions, and cleaning functions; logs warnings on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'decode' on non-byte objects in '_coerce_unicode' may cause errors; exception handling is unconventional; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data cleaning and datetime handling functionalities. 'guess_timezone' attempts to convert naive datetimes to aware ones based on local time or defaults to UTC. 'clean' functions recursively process data structures, converting Decimals to float and attempting to decode complex objects. The '_coerce_unicode' function uses 'decode' on potentially non-byte objects, which may raise exceptions, but this appears to be for data normalization rather than malicious intent. No network activity, credential handling, or system manipulation observed. Logging is used for warnings, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains utility functions for data normalization and datetime handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code is primarily benign, focused on data processing, with some questionable exception handling but no malicious intent detected.",
