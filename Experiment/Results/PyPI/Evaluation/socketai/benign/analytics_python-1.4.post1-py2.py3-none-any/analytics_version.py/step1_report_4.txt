  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a version string assignment; no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to a variable named VERSION, which is common in Python packages. No input handling, no data processing, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. This minimal code fragment does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
