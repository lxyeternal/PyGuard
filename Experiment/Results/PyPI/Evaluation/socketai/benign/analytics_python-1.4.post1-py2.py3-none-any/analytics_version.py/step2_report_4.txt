  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the reports and the code snippet:\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nVERSION = '1.4.post1'\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable named `VERSION`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- This pattern is common in Python packages for versioning.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.  \n   - Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Also correctly states the code is minimal and harmless.  \n   - Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Accurately notes the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.  \n   - Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Recognizes the code as a standard version assignment with no malicious behavior.  \n   - Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Correctly describes the code as a common version string assignment with no risks.  \n   - Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is only a version string assignment, there are no grounds to increase the malware or security risk scores.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is entirely benign, and the provided reports correctly reflect that. The scoring aligns with the nature of the code, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
