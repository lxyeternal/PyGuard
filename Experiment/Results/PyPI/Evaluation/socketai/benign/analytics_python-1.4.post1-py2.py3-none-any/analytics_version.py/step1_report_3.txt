  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks possible as there is no data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies; only a version string declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string variable, which is common in Python packaging. No input sources, no data processing, no untrusted data flow, and no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. There are no complex structures or obfuscation. Given the simplicity, it appears to be a standard version declaration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The code is benign and typical for Python packages.",
