  "purpose": "A threaded consumer that batches data from a queue and uploads it via HTTP POST requests, with retry logic and error handling.",
  "sources": "Data read from the queue via queue.get() within the next() method.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request made in request() method to upload batched data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from queue.get() to batch list, then to post() function via request(), with retries on network or server errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscated segments, no unusual network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a data consumer that batches items from a queue, respecting size and time limits, and uploads via HTTP with retries. It uses external parameters for credentials and endpoints, employs proper error handling, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The network activity appears legitimate for telemetry purposes. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data uploader with no malicious intent or security flaws evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with network communication but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
