  "purpose": "Provides version information by parsing a static JSON string generated by 'versioneer.py'.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string 'version_json' containing version metadata.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' function parsing the static JSON string; no untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "From the static JSON string to the 'json.loads' function, returning a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, hardcoded data with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'json', defines a static JSON string with version info, and provides a function to parse and return this data. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code is straightforward and serves as a version info utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and the confidence is high. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
