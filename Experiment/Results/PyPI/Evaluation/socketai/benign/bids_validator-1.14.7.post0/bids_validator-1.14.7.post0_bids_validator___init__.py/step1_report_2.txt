  "purpose": "To provide a common interface for the BIDS validator functionality in Python.",
  "sources": "Importing the BIDSValidator class from a local module, and retrieving version info from a local _version module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and version info from local modules, exposes the class via __all__, and assigns a version string. There are no inputs, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors present. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple imports and version setup without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
