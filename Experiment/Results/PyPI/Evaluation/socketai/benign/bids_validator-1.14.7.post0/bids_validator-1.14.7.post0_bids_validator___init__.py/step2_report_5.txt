  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity are identified.\n- The code simply imports a class and version info, exposes the class via `__all__`, and sets `__version__`.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities or security flaws are evident in this minimal setup code.\n- The versioning mechanism appears standard, retrieving version info from a local module.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification needed.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely to expose classes and set version info.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume standard behavior; no assumptions about hidden malicious intent are made.\n- The code structure is typical for Python package initialization.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard `__init__.py` for a Python package, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and follows typical patterns for package initialization. No further security concerns are warranted based on the provided code snippet.",
