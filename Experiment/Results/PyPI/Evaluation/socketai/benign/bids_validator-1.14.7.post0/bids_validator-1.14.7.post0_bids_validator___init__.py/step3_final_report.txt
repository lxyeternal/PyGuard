  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing the BIDSValidator class and setting the package version.",
  "sources": "Importing BIDSValidator from local module, retrieving version info from _version.get_versions()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Import of BIDSValidator and version info retrieval; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, importing a class and setting version info. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The code does not perform network activity, data handling, or dynamic execution. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package initialization, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The existing reports and scores are accurate and require no adjustments.",
