  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward package initializer, importing a class and setting version info.\n- **Issues:** No issues found; no malicious code or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also accurately describes the code as a typical __init__.py pattern.\n- **Issues:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard package initialization.\n- **Issues:** No suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard import/export pattern.\n- **Issues:** No anomalies or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states this is a typical package init script.\n- **Issues:** No suspicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard package initializer with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or dynamic execution.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is a minimal, typical __init__.py file for a Python package, there are no security risks or malicious elements to escalate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard for Python package initialization.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**.",
