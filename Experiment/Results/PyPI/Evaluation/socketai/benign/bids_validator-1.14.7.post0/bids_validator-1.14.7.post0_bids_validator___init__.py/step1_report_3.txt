{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point for the BIDS validator package, exposing the BIDSValidator class and setting the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module and package metadata to define exports and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing internal modules to defining the package's public API and version information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a class from a relative module, defines an export list, and retrieves version info from a module. All operations are standard for Python package __init__.py files. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious external communications, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and typical for a Python package's initialization file. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
