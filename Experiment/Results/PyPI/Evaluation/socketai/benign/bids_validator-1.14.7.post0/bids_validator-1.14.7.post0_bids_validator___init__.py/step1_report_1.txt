{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package that exposes a BIDSValidator class and sets the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .bids_validator import BIDSValidator, from . import _version; Data: __version__ set from _version.get_versions()",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__, usage of imported modules",
  "flows": "Import modules -> assign __version__ from _version.get_versions() -> expose BIDSValidator class",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious import patterns, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and exposes it via __all__, which is standard for Python packages. It then imports a versioning module to set the package version. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward, primarily involved in exposing functionalities and setting version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer for a Python module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes a class and sets version info, following standard patterns.",
