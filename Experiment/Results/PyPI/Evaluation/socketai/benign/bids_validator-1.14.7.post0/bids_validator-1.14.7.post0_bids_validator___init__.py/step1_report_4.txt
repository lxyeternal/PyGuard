{
  "purpose": "This code imports and exposes the BIDSValidator class from a local module, and sets the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.bids_validator and _version).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no external input handling or data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily performs module exports and version setting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python import and export statements. It imports BIDSValidator from a local module, sets __all__, and assigns __version__ from a versioning utility. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious constructs are present. The versioning logic appears standard, pulling version info from a local _version module. Overall, this is a typical package initialization file without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module exports and version setting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
