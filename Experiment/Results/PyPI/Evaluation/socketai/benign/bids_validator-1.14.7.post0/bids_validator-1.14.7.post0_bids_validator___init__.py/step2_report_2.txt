  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python package initializer (__init__.py), importing a class and setting version info.\n- No suspicious import patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are noted.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no external network activity or data handling.\n- The version info is retrieved from a local _version module, which is typical.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the description in all reports; no issues are present.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code is minimal and standard for package setup.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None identified. The logic and structure are correct and typical.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, and the code is a standard package initializer, there's no justification for higher scores.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n**Malware considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n- The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume benign behavior based on static analysis; this is appropriate.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. The existing reports and scores are accurate.",
