  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package using setuptools and versioneer.",
  "sources": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'versioneer', then calls setup() with version and cmdclass obtained from versioneer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external inputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version information from versioneer and passes it to setuptools.setup(), with no data flowing from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging, uses versioneer to dynamically obtain version info, and calls setup() accordingly. It does not process external input or execute any malicious actions. The structure and content are typical for a setup.py file in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply configures package metadata using versioneer.",
