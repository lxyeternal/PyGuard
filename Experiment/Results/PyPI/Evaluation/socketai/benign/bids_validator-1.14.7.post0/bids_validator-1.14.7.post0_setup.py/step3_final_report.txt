  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and versioneer; calls to versioneer.get_version() and versioneer.get_cmdclass() within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of version info from versioneer to setup() without external input or data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate setup.py script that imports standard packaging libraries and calls setup() with dynamic version info. It contains no external input handling, no malicious code, and follows common practices. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
