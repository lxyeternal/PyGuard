  "sources": "Reads the environment and versioneer module to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports versioneer, calls get_version and get_cmdclass to provide version information during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'versioneer', then calls setup with dynamically obtained version and command class. This is a common and legitimate approach to package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
