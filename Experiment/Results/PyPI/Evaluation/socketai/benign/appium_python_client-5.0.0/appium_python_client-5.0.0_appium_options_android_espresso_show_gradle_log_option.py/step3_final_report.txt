  "purpose": "Manage a capability for showing Gradle logs within a configuration framework.",
  "sources": "The get_capability and set_capability methods, which access or modify the 'showGradleLog' capability.",
  "sinks": "The set_capability method, which updates internal capability state; no external data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'value' flows into set_capability; retrieval via get_capability is read-only, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for managing a boolean capability. It relies on inherited methods presumed to be secure. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The getter and setter follow standard patterns, and the code is clear and maintainable. The security implications are minimal, limited to configuration management. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
