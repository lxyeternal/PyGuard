  "flows": "Import os and sys -> insert absolute path '../appium' into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative path '../appium' in sys.path modification; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports os and sys, then modifies sys.path to include a relative directory '../appium'. This is a common practice for local module inclusion. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The path modification could be exploited if the directory is malicious, but in typical use, it is benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file with a typical sys.path modification. The potential security concern regarding the relative path is minimal and context-dependent. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
