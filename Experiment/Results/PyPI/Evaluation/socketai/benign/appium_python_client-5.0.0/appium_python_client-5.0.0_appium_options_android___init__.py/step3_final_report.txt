{
  "purpose": "The code imports configuration classes for automation frameworks, specifically EspressoOptions and UiAutomator2Options, likely used for mobile testing setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal module files: .espresso.base and .uiautomator2.base to import classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present; the code only imports classes without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for configuration classes, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the scores are consistent with the code's minimal and benign structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
