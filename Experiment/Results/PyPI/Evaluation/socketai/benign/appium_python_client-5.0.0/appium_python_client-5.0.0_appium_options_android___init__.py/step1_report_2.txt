{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be importing specific classes from modules within the same package, likely for configuring or setting options related to Espresso and UI Automator2 testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only internal module imports are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, only imports without any additional logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes, EspressoOptions and UiAutomator2Options, from internal modules. This is typical in test automation setups. No external input, no data processing, no command execution, and no network activity are evident. The minimal nature reduces likelihood of malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard import statements used for test configuration or setup, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and straightforward.",
