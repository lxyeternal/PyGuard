  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, likely intended for general functionality or specific task execution. No explicit purpose is identified due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files (if present). Specific sources are not evident without actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, displays output, or makes network requests. Without code details, specific sinks cannot be identified.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (user input, environment, files) to sinks (outputs, network), but exact paths are unclear without code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code signatures visible.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of visible code, the analysis indicates an absence of suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No evidence of malware, insecure practices, or anomalous code structures. The code appears standard and benign based on available information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet (which is empty or not included), there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, but without actual code content, this assessment is based on the absence of detectable issues.",
