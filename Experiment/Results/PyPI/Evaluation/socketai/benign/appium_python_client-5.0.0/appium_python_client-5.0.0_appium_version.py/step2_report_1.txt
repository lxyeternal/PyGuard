  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Content**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of the string `'5.0.0'` to a variable named `version`. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic involved. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:  \n   None of the reports detect any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and without security concerns.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Malware Scores**:  \n   All reports assign `obfuscated: 0` and `malware: 0`. This aligns with the simplicity of the code and the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Security Risk**:  \n   Since the code is just a version string assignment, the `securityRisk` is appropriately `0` across all reports.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code's simplicity. No report suggests any reason to adjust the scores upward.\n\n6. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:  \n   - The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n   - The assumption that a version declaration is benign is correct in typical scenarios.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - Even if the code is harmless, in some contexts, malicious actors could hide malicious code elsewhere. But based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk associated with this code snippet)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- Keep `malware: 0`  \n- Keep `obfuscated: 0`  \n- Keep `securityRisk: 0`  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence provided and the nature of the code snippet.",
