  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string '5.0.0' assigned to the variable 'version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static assignment from source (literal string) to variable; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string, with no inputs, outputs, or external calls. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
