  "purpose": "Define the version string for a software package or module",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources present)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks present)",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code only assigns a static string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple assignment statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line that assigns the string '5.0.0' to the variable 'version'. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks involved. The code appears to be a version declaration for a software component, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
