  "purpose": "Manage the 'espressoServerLaunchTimeout' capability with getter and setter, converting between timedelta and milliseconds.",
  "sources": "get_capability method retrieves the capability value; set_capability method sets the capability value.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or untrusted data flows; capability values are handled internally.",
  "flows": "Getter retrieves capability; setter converts timedelta or int to milliseconds and sets capability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard class managing a configuration capability for Espresso server launch timeout. It uses typical getter/setter patterns, performs safe type conversions, and relies on inherited methods for capability management. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. All signals indicate benign, intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for managing a timeout capability within an automation framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high security risk score in one report (0.95) is an overestimation; the overall assessment indicates minimal to no security concern.",
