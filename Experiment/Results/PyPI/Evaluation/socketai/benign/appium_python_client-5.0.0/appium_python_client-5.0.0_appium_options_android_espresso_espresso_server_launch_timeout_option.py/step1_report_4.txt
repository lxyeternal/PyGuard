  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing the Espresso server launch timeout capability in an Appium testing framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the capability value 'espressoServerLaunchTimeout' via get_capability method.",
  "sinks": "Sets the capability value 'espressoServerLaunchTimeout' via set_capability method.",
  "flows": "Retrieves the timeout value from capabilities, converts to timedelta if needed, and sets the timeout value in milliseconds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and maintains standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class that manages a specific capability for Appium, allowing the setting and getting of the server launch timeout. It uses standard property decorators and methods for capability management. There are no signs of malicious intent, no external network calls, or data leaks. The code only manipulates local data and capabilities with clear, documented behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a capability management class for Appium, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
