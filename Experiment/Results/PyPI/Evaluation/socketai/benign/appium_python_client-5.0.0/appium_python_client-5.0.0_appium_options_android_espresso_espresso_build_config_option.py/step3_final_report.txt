  "flows": "Retrieving capability value, parsing JSON in getter; serializing JSON in setter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles JSON serialization/deserialization with exception handling, typical for configuration management. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The only minor concern is potential untrusted data in capabilities, but this is standard for configuration data and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe configuration handler with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal potential issues related to untrusted data handling, which is typical in such contexts.",
