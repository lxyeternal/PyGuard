  "flows": "Input data flows from the app_locale setter to the internal capability store through set_capability.",
  "anomalies": "None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for managing app locale capabilities, with getter and setter methods. It interacts with a superclass presumed to handle capability storage. The URL in the docstring is informational. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The data flow is limited to internal capability dictionaries. The code is straightforward and standard for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external URL is informational and does not introduce risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external calls confirm its safety.",
