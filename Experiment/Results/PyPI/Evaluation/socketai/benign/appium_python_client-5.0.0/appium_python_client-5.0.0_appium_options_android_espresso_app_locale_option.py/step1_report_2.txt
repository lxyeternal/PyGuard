  "sources": "Reading the APP_LOCALE capability via get_capability method; receiving a dictionary input for setting app_locale.",
  "sinks": "Calling set_capability to store the locale data; no external or untrusted data output detected.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary 'value' to set_capability method, with retrieval via get_capability; no data flows outside the scope.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The URL provided is for language codes documentation, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of a support class to manage locale settings for an app. It uses properties and setters to manipulate capabilities, with no external data sources or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior. The URL provided links to language code info, which is harmless. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for setting locale options in a testing environment. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
