{
  "purpose": "Provide Flask testing utilities and handle optional dependency on 'twill' for testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement for 'twill' and the import of utility functions from '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Import attempt of 'twill' (source) leads to setting a flag and conditional class assignment, but no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try-except block for optional dependency loading, and defines an Error class that raises ImportError if 'twill' is missing. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and attempts to import an optional third-party package 'twill'. If unavailable, it defines placeholder classes that raise ImportError when instantiated, indicating the dependency is optional. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The approach of handling optional dependencies by raising exceptions on usage is standard and does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for Flask testing, with safe handling of optional dependencies. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
