  "sources": "Initialization parameters, URL method, WSGI intercept setup and teardown.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "URL method constructs URLs; setup/teardown manage WSGI intercepts without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated StringIO module (Python 2), but no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides testing utilities for Flask applications using Twill, mainly managing WSGI intercepts and URL generation. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The use of StringIO from Python 2 is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is benign, serving as infrastructure for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign testing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.05 to 0.1) due to outdated practices but not actual vulnerabilities.",
