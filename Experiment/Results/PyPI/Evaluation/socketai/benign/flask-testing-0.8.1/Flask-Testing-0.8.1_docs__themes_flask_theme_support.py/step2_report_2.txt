  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a static class defining a custom Pygments style based on the Tango theme.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or system interactions are present.\n- The code is purely cosmetic, involving color and style mappings.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a static style configuration with no security concerns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **In the reports:** No factual errors or logical flaws are present. The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5, reflecting no security risk. Given the static nature and benign purpose, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is purely stylistic and static.\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static, and purely cosmetic nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is a straightforward style definition.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that style configuration files remain static and free of any dynamic or external data processing to maintain security.",
