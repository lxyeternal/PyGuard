{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style theme.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pygments.style' and 'pygments.token'. The class definition and style dictionary are all contained within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or processing is present in this static style configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or dynamic behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a straightforward style class definition with no runtime data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports style and token classes from Pygments, then defines a class 'FlaskyStyle' that inherits from Style. It sets background color, default style, and a comprehensive styles dictionary mapping tokens to specific styles. There are no code injections, environment variable usages, or runtime computations. The style definitions are static, straightforward, and intended solely for syntax highlighting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static style configuration for Pygments with no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is purely aesthetic and does not interact with external data or perform any actions beyond defining style mappings.",
