{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style theme.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static style configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling classes and tokens, then defines a subclass FlaskyStyle with specific style attributes. All content appears to be static, defining color schemes and text styles for syntax highlighting. No external data is processed, nor are there any dynamic or potentially unsafe operations. The code appears to be purely cosmetic, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom Pygments style for syntax highlighting. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risks.",
