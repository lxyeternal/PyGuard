{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules, class definition with style attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; code does not execute or handle external inputs.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; style class attributes are hardcoded. No dynamic data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is purely stylistic and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling components and defines a style class with static style mappings for syntax highlighting tokens. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward, and all code is static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static style definition for syntax highlighting, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a benign styling configuration for Pygments.",
