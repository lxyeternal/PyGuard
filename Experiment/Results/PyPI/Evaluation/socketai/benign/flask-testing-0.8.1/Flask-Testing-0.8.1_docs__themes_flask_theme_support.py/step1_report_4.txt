{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token; class definition with style mappings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; purely style configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets style properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports style and token modules from Pygments, then defines a class inheriting from Style, setting background color, default style, and a dictionary of token styles. All styles are hardcoded string literals specifying colors and font styles. No user input, environment variables, or external data is involved. No function calls, loops, or dynamic code constructs are present. The code solely configures syntax highlighting styles, which is a static and safe operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration for syntax highlighting, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions.",
