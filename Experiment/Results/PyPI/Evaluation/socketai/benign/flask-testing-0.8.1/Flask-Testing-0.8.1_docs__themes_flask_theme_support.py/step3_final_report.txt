  "purpose": "Static style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighting, defining color schemes for various token types.",
  "sources": "No external data, input, or dynamic code; only class attributes and style mappings are defined.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any system or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static style definitions with no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and purely cosmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining style mappings for syntax highlighting, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or system interactions. It contains only hardcoded style attributes and no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for Pygments with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores and analysis are accurate and justified.",
