  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, a syntax highlighting library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pygments.style and pygments.token; class definition for FlaskyStyle with style configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no system calls or network operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is a static style configuration, no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling components from the Pygments library and defines a Style subclass with specific style configurations for syntax highlighting. It sets colors and font styles for various token types without executing any dynamic or system-level code. There are no input sources or output sinks, nor any data flow. The code appears to be purely declarative style configuration intended for aesthetic purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration for syntax highlighting styles. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and benign.",
