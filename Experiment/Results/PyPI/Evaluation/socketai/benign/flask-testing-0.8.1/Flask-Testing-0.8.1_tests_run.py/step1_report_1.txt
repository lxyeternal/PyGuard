  "purpose": "The script runs unittests for a project and optionally generates code coverage reports.",
  "sources": "The script reads from the 'tests' module and the 'coverage' package if available.",
  "sinks": "The script does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform any insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Imports 'coverage' -> starts coverage measurement -> runs tests -> stops coverage -> reports coverage",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'coverage' and runs unittests from a specified 'suite'. If coverage is available, it measures and reports coverage metrics. The flow is typical for a testing harness. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses standard Python modules and packages, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test runner with optional coverage reporting. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and purposeful.",
