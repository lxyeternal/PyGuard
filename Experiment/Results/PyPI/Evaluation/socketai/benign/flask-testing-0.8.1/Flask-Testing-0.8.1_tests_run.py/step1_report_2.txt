{
  "purpose": "This script runs unit tests for a project, optionally utilizing the coverage library to measure code coverage, and reports the results.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules sys, unittest, and conditionally coverage; it also imports 'suite' from 'tests'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'unittest.TextTestRunner' to run tests and calls 'sys.exit(1)' on failure. It outputs coverage reports and prints informational messages.",
  "flows": "Input data from imported modules (coverage, sys, unittest), execution flow runs tests, conditionally collects and reports coverage, and may terminate the process with sys.exit.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution, external data transmission, or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports the coverage module, starts coverage measurement if available, runs test suite from 'tests', reports success or failure, and optionally generates coverage reports. It uses standard modules and follows expected patterns for test running and coverage reporting. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code's logic is straightforward and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test runner with optional coverage measurement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
