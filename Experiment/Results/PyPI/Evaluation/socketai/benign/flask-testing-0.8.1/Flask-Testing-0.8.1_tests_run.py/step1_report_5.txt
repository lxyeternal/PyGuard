{
  "purpose": "The script runs unit tests using unittest framework and optionally generates code coverage reports if the 'coverage' library is available.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'tests' module (importing 'suite'), the system arguments, and the 'coverage' library if available.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; output is primarily to the console and coverage report files.",
  "flows": "The script loads test suite from 'tests.suite()', runs tests, and if coverage is enabled, collects and reports code coverage data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code's logic is straightforward for testing purposes. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports and uses the 'coverage' library to measure test coverage for the 'flask_testing' module, runs the tests from 'tests.suite()', and reports results. It exits with code 1 if tests fail. The import of 'coverage' is conditional and handled gracefully. The code uses standard unittest and coverage APIs, with no suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or external connections. No backdoors, malicious code, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test runner with optional coverage reporting. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and intended for testing and coverage analysis.",
