{
  "purpose": "The script runs a test suite and optionally reports code coverage statistics for the 'flask_testing' source.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'sys', 'unittest', and conditionally 'coverage'. Reads no untrusted external input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output via print and sys.exit. No untrusted data flows into critical functions.",
  "flows": "The script executes tests and, if coverage is enabled, reports coverage. No data flows from external untrusted sources into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code structure is straightforward and standard for test runners.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the 'coverage' module to measure code coverage of a specified source ('flask_testing'). It then runs a test suite imported from 'tests'. Based on the success of tests, it exits with status 1 if failed, and reports coverage if enabled. There are no suspicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only optional feature is coverage reporting, which is a common testing utility.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard test runner with optional code coverage reporting. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and intended for testing purposes only.",
