  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a Flask testing utility with context management, response handling, template/message assertions, and live server support.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; standard testing practices; no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard Flask testing utilities with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Perfectly consistent; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical Flask testing framework with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard Flask testing utilities, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; very low risk, consistent with benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Testing framework with socket checks and signal handling, all standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score but still very low; all behaviors are typical for testing frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard, benign Flask testing utilities.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Flow and anomalies:** No suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Behavior:** All features are typical for testing frameworks—signal handling, socket checks, context management, monkey patching for testing, no external code execution or data exfiltration.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The scores reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The low security risk scores are justified.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard testing utilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a legitimate Flask testing utility with no security concerns.",
