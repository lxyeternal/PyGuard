  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'Flask-Testing' with conditional dependencies based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version checks, __doc__ for long_description, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Version checks control dependencies; static data flow with no external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration, no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It performs version-based dependency inclusion, uses __doc__ for description, and contains no external data fetching, network activity, or obfuscated code. All dependency management practices are standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is safe, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All signals point to a benign, standard configuration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concerns.",
