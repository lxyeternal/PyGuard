  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It conditionally adds testing dependencies based on Python version. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated constructs. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices without any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages dependencies based on Python version and does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
