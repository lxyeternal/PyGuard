  "purpose": "Setup script for the Flask-Testing package, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, __doc__",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data output or external interactions beyond package setup",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional dependencies; __doc__ -> long_description",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It conditionally appends dependencies based on Python version, which is common practice. No external network connections, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The __doc__ string is used for the long_description, which is safe. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
