  "purpose": "Setup script for the Flask-Testing package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, package metadata (author_email), and dependencies (install_requires, tests_require).",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure data handling is minimal; no untrusted data sinks present. No network, file, or external system access.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily processes static data and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward package setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for version checks, defines dependencies conditionally, and configures package metadata via setuptools.setup(). There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated constructs. All dependencies and metadata are static and standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only manages dependencies and package information with no external communication or sensitive data handling.",
