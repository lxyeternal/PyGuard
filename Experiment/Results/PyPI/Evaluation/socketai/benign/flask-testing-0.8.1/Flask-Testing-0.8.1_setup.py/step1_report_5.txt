  "sources": "Imports sys module, reads __doc__ for long_description, and uses setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs or untrusted data handling beyond package setup metadata.",
  "flows": "Imports sys to determine Python version for conditional dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It conditionally adds dependencies based on Python version and sets package metadata. No network operations, no execution of untrusted code, and no insecure data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code strictly handles package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic.",
