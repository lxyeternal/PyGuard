  "purpose": "Setup script for the Flask-Testing Python package, specifying dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (Python version) and package metadata such as author_email, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted external data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "System version checks influence which dependencies are added; metadata is statically assigned and not influenced by external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup for a Python package, conditionally adding dependencies based on Python version. No external data is fetched or processed dynamically during execution. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging Flask-Testing. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
