  "purpose": "Define interfaces for resource management, including resource retrieval, factory creation, and ETag computation in a web framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; the code solely defines interfaces and class structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is purely interface definitions with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code consists of interface declarations only, with no implementation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of interface definitions for resource management within a web framework, including resource representation, factory creation, and ETag calculation. It imports only standard interface attributes and defines method signatures without any implementation. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard design patterns for modularity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of interface definitions intended for resource handling in a web application framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
