  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to declaration of namespace, no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' with a string argument is uncommon but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically using '__import__', then calls 'declare_namespace' to declare the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern for namespace packages and does not involve any malicious behavior or external data transmission. No other code, inputs, or sinks are present. The minimal nature of this code makes it unlikely to be malicious. The use of '__import__' with a string is slightly uncommon but valid and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and contains no malicious or security risks. It appears to be a benign, purposeful setup step in package management.",
