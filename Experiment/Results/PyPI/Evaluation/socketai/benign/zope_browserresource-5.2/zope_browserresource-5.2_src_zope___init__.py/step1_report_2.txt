  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks or malicious data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' (source) to 'declare_namespace' call (sink). No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, utilizing a standard namespace declaration method; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging for shared namespace packages. The syntax is straightforward and uses the standard API. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or hidden backdoors. No input handling or external data sources are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data storage, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration for Python packages. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is solely to declare a namespace package, with no suspicious activity.",
