  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling declare_namespace(__name__) does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declaration; no unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and uses its 'declare_namespace' function on __name__ to define a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python packages to support namespace separation. No hardcoded secrets, code execution, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard namespace declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
