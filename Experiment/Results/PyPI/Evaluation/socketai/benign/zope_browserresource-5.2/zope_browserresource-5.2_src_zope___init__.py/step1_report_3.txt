  "sources": "Import statement that loads the 'pkg_resources' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output",
  "flows": "Import 'pkg_resources' -> declare namespace via __name__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard namespace declaration with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package using 'declare_namespace'. This is a common pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. No input/output operations, no data leaks, no suspicious code flow, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code does not read or process any external data nor does it perform any actions beyond namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves a structural purpose in Python packaging.",
