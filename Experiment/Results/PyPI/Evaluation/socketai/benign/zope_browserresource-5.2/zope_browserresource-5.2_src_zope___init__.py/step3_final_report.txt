  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkg_resources') instead of a standard import statement; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration for a Python package, utilizing __import__ to dynamically import 'pkg_resources' and declare the namespace with __name__. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of __import__ is slightly less common but legitimate in certain packaging contexts. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0 or 0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9-1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
