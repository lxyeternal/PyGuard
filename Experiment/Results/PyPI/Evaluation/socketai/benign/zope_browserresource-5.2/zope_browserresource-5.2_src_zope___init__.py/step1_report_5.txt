  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' occurs at the start; no data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' function with a string argument to dynamically import a module; common in namespace package declarations but can be misused in malicious context. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module via '__import__' and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module name. This pattern is standard for setting up namespace packages in Python and is provided by the 'setuptools' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious obfuscation. The code is minimal and adheres to typical namespace declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate namespace package declaration using 'pkg_resources'. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks associated with this code snippet.",
