  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input data, network or system commands, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, system commands, file operations, data exfiltration points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs/env variables) flow into sinks (network/system commands) via dynamic execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, suspicious URLs, inconsistent naming, unused imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks, with multiple suspicious patterns such as eval/exec usage and embedded secrets. No explicit malicious payloads like system damage or data theft are confirmed, but the suspicious patterns warrant caution. The overall structure suggests a high likelihood of malicious or heavily obfuscated code, especially in the most suspicious segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates multiple red flags including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The risk score should reflect this, and further dynamic or static analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior.",
