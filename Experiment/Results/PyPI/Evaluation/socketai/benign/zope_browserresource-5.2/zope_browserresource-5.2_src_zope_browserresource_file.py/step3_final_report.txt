{
  "purpose": "Provides static file resources with HTTP caching, ETag validation, and file serving capabilities.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads during object initialization; request headers for cache validation (If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match); response headers for cache control.",
  "sinks": "Response headers (ETag, Last-Modified, Cache-Control, Expires); file data returned in GET requests.",
  "flows": "Request headers influence cache validation logic; cache validation results determine whether to serve 304 or full content; file data is served upon valid requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The _testData method is for testing purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard static resource handler with proper cache validation, ETag handling, and file serving. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The regex for parsing ETags is standard. The file is loaded into memory during initialization, which is typical for such handlers. The cache validation logic correctly handles conditional GET requests. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured static file resource handler with proper HTTP caching support. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal and consistent with standard static resource serving. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical filesystem access concerns but no active vulnerabilities.",
