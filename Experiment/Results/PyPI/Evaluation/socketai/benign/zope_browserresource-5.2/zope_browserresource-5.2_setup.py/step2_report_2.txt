  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code with the provided details.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code reads local files for long descriptions and defines dependencies statically.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code follows typical patterns for setuptools-based packaging.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmed issues\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The dependency list appears standard and safe.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes\n- The reports correctly identify that the script is a typical setup.py file.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or implementation.\n- The only minor note is that the `find_packages('src')` assumes a specific directory structure, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Scores review\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1 confidently.\n- Given the analysis, **malware score should be 0** because there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score should be 0** since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score** should be very low, close to 0, because this is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Justification for scores\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or code execution based on untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- The purpose is solely package configuration.\n\n### Potential overestimations\n- The reports' high confidence scores (1.0) are justified given the code's benign nature.\n- The malware score should be **0**, not 1, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n### Final assessment\nBased on the detailed review, I estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (standard, safe setup script)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are appropriate, but the malware and obfuscated scores should be zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nUpdate the malware and obfuscated scores to 0 to reflect the benign nature of this code.",
