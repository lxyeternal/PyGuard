  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators of Malware**  \nAll reports uniformly conclude that the script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, with no suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious constructs. The code only reads local files and invokes setuptools.setup() with static data. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors are detected.  \n**Verdict:** No signs of malware. Malware score should remain 0.\n\n2. **Obfuscation or Hidden Malicious Patterns**  \nAll reports note that the code is straightforward, following typical setup.py conventions, with no obfuscation or unusual patterns.  \n**Verdict:** Obfuscated score should be 0.\n\n3. **Security Risks or Flaws**  \nSince the code is only performing static file reads and package configuration, with no external data handling or dynamic code execution, the security risk is minimal. All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Security risk score should be 0.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is standard and benign. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency and Justification**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risks identified)  \n\nGiven the thorough analysis, the scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no security issues. No changes to the reported scores are necessary.",
