  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the zope.browserresource package, including dependencies, metadata, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files; importing modules such as os and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no use of untrusted data or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting package metadata -> calling setup() with configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements observed. No network activity or system modification detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads local documentation files, specifies dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with package information. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution occurs. No indication of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code strictly performs package configuration and installation setup, following conventional patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It contains no malware, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate package configuration file.",
