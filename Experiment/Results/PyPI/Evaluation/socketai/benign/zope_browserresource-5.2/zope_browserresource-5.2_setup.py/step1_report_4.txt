  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'zope.browserresource' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long description; importing standard libraries and setuptools for setup process.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily performs static setup tasks without data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; code follows standard setup.py practices without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration file for a Python package. It reads static files for descriptions, defines dependencies, and invokes setuptools.setup with package metadata. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code structure is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and only manages package installation metadata.",
