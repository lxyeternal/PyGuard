  "purpose": "Configuration schema definitions for Zope resources, icons, directories, and internationalization directives.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Zope configuration fields and interfaces, class definitions with schema fields and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no external communication or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static schema definitions, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external data processing, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of declarative interface and schema class definitions for configuring resources, icons, directories, and internationalization in Zope. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime logic. Deprecated attributes are noted but do not pose security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain hidden backdoors. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of configuration schemas for Zope, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
