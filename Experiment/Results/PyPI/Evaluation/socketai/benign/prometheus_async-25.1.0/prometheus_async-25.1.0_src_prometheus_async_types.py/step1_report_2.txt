{
  "purpose": "Defines type hints, protocols, and imports for a Python package related to metrics and service discovery, with no explicit implementation logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, third-party modules, and conditional type imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly establishes type annotations and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type checking imports and conditional imports are standard for compatibility, no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, type variable definitions, and protocol class declarations to facilitate static type checking and interface definitions. It includes conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. There are no functions or logic that process external data, no code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. The presence of deprecated notices and comments indicates maintenance and versioning considerations, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type definition and interface setup for a larger package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no malware signals. The only notable aspect is its focus on static typing and compatibility, which does not pose security risks.",
