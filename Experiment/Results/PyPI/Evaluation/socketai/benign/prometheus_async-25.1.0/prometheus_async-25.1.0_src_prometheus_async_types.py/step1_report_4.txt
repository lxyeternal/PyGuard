{
  "purpose": "Define protocols and type aliases for a metrics and service discovery system, facilitating asynchronous operations and type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially from standard libraries (sys, typing), third-party libraries (prometheus_async, twisted), and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data output or external network communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; mostly static type definitions and protocol interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a typical type hinting and protocol definition module, with a deprecated interface noted.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, type variable and protocol definitions, and conditional imports based on environment and Python version. It does not execute any external commands, handle untrusted input, or contain code that could be malicious. The deprecated class indicates it is maintained but not actively used. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module used for defining type interfaces and compatibility across Python versions. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
