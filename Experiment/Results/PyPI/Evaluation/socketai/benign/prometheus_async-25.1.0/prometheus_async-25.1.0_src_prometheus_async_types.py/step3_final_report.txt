  "purpose": "Defines type annotations, protocols, and compatibility imports for asynchronous metrics and service discovery components in Python.",
  "sources": "Type variable definitions, import statements, class and protocol declarations, conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static type/interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecated class indicating maintenance; standard compatibility handling; no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, type variable definitions, and Protocol classes for async metrics and service discovery. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The deprecation notice is standard. No obfuscation or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward, serving as static interface definitions, with high confidence in benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-maintained interface module for async metrics and service discovery, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
