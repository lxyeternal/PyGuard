{
  "purpose": "The code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup for the 'prometheus-async' project.",
  "sources": "metadata.version('prometheus-async') to retrieve the package version; user-defined lists for extensions, templates_path, exclude_patterns, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no data leaks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are assigned directly from static lists or package metadata; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'metadata.version' to dynamically obtain package version; no signs of obfuscated code or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'metadata' from 'importlib' to retrieve package version, which is standard practice. The rest of the code defines static configuration options for Sphinx documentation generation, including extensions, paths, and ignore patterns. All data sources are either static or derived from package metadata. There are no external inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages documentation settings with static data and package metadata retrieval, posing no security threat.",
