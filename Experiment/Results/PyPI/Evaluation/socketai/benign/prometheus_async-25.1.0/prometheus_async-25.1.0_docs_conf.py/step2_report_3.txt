  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script for the 'prometheus-async' project.\n- They emphasize that the code only sets configuration parameters, loads package version info via `importlib.metadata`, and does not process untrusted input or perform any dynamic or external data handling.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and an obfuscated score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears to be a typical Sphinx configuration file with no evident security issues.\n- The only dynamic operation is `metadata.version(\"prometheus-async\")`, which is a standard and safe way to retrieve package version info.\n- No user input, external data, or network activity is involved.\n- No code execution, data processing, or sink functions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The configuration is straightforward, and all data flows are static or from trusted sources.\n- The use of `metadata.version()` is safe and common in such scripts.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment, confirming the benign nature.\n- The only \"dynamic\" element, fetching version info, is a standard practice and does not introduce risk.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly identifies the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Based on all evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The code is a typical, safe configuration script with no signs of malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
