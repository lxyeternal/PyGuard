  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, including extensions, paths, and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Retrieves package version via importlib.metadata.version('prometheus-async').",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration with no untrusted data or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; version info fetched from package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with safe version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports package version info safely using importlib.metadata, sets static configuration parameters, and does not process user input, external data, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The version retrieval is a common, safe practice. The code structure is clear, and all data flows are from trusted sources. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0. The overall assessment is consistent and justified.",
