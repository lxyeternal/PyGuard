{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and functions for asyncio that measure and track execution time, exception counts, and in-progress operations, mainly for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (`time`, `typing`), external package (`wrapt`, `prometheus_client`), and type hints.",
  "sinks": "Uses `metric.observe()`, `metric.inc()`, and `metric.dec()` which could potentially send or modify monitoring data. No direct data leaks or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Decorators wrap asynchronous functions to measure runtime (`time`), count exceptions (`count_exceptions`), or track in-progress operations (`track_inprogress`), invoking metric methods before and after the wrapped functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. The code uses common monitoring patterns without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several decorators and functions for monitoring asyncio functions, involving measuring execution time, counting exceptions, and tracking in-progress operations. It leverages the 'wrapt' library for decorators and 'prometheus_client' for metrics, which is standard for such use cases. No untrusted input sources, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions simply update metrics based on the execution flow. All code appears to serve legitimate monitoring purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard monitoring decorators for asyncio functions, using established libraries and techniques. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate, with no suspicious or harmful patterns.",
