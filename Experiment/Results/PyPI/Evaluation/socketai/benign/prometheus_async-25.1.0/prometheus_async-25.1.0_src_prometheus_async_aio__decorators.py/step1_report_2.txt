{
  "purpose": "Provides asyncio decorators for timing, exception counting, and in-progress tracking, integrated with Prometheus metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads standard library functions (perf_counter), imported decorators, and external metrics objects (Observer, Incrementer, Gauge).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write untrusted data or send data over network; it only updates Prometheus metrics.",
  "flows": "The code measures and records timing, exception occurrences, and in-progress state by invoking metric methods within wrapped async functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard patterns for decorators and asyncio handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several decorators for asyncio coroutines: timing, exception counting, and in-progress metrics tracking. It uses 'wrapt' for decorator creation and the 'perf_counter' for high-resolution timing. Decorators wrap the target functions, capturing start times, exception handling, and in-progress state updates, all of which update external Prometheus metrics objects. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration, is present. The code relies on external metric objects passed as parameters. It adheres to standard async patterns and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of asyncio metric decorators designed for performance and monitoring purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply updates external Prometheus metrics, consistent with expected monitoring practices.",
