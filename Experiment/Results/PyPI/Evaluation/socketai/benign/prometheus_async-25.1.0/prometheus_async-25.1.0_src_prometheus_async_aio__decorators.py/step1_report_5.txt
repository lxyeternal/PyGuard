{
  "purpose": "Provides asyncio decorators for timing, counting exceptions, and tracking in-progress executions with Prometheus metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses imported libraries and parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially invokes metric.observe(), metric.inc(), and metric.dec(), but these are intended for monitoring and do not pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Decorators wrap async functions to measure execution time, count exceptions, or track in-progress tasks, updating Prometheus metrics accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Code is well-structured, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of asyncio-related decorators that interface with Prometheus metrics for monitoring purposes. It uses standard library functions and a third-party 'wrapt' library for decorators. No external data is read beyond function parameters. The functions perform monitoring actions like observing execution time, counting exceptions, and tracking in-progress status by incrementing/decrementing metrics. All metric interactions appear to be for monitoring and do not facilitate malicious activities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. The structure is clean and consistent with common monitoring implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of asyncio decorators for monitoring purposes using Prometheus metrics. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation intended for performance and exception tracking.",
