{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions for measuring execution time, counting exceptions, and tracking in-progress tasks for asyncio-based functions, mainly for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own function parameters, imported modules, and the asyncio Future objects provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to external metrics objects (like `metric.observe()`, `metric.inc()`, `metric.dec()`) which could theoretically be manipulated if the metrics objects are untrusted, but these are typical for monitoring libraries. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (function arguments, asyncio Futures) flow into decorators or functions, which then invoke metrics methods and execute the wrapped functions, with timing and exception counting occurring during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code uses standard monitoring patterns, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements asyncio decorators for timing, exception counting, and in-progress tracking using metrics objects (Observer, Incrementer, Gauge). It uses standard Python features, type annotations, and wrapt decorators. The functions are designed for monitoring and instrumentation; they do not execute untrusted data or external commands. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are observed. The metrics functions are commonly used in monitoring setups, and their invocation appears safe. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of monitoring decorators for asyncio functions, utilizing metrics objects for timing, exception counting, and in-progress tracking. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code is safe for use in a monitoring context.",
