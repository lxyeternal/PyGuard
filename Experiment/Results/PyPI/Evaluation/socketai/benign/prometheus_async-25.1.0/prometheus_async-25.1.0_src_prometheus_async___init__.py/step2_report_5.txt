  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a standard package init, importing local modules and providing a version attribute via __getattr__. No suspicious behavior, no malicious code, no external data leaks.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the benign nature observed.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe, standard practices. The dynamic version retrieval is common and safe.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard package setup, optional import handling, safe dynamic version retrieval. Slight mention of a security risk score of 0.1, but no specific reason is given.  \n- **Potential concern:** The only \"sink\" is the call to `importlib.metadata.version(\"prometheus-async\")`. However, this is a safe, read-only operation fetching package metadata.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (possibly overly cautious).  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 seems unwarranted given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard package init, safe practices, no malicious code.  \n- **Score justification:** All zeroes, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard practices.  \n- **Score justification:** All zeroes, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward package initializer, with no code executing untrusted input, network activity, or malicious logic. **Final malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation techniques are present; the code is clear and readable. **Final obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk score:** The only slight concern is the dynamic version retrieval, but it's a common, safe pattern. No external data or untrusted inputs are involved. Therefore, a risk score of 0.0 or very close to it is appropriate. Given the reports' scores of 0 or 0.1, I agree with 0.0 for a conservative, accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report could be lowered to 0.0, considering the safe, standard practice used.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0.0** | **0.0**      | **0.0** |\n\nThis reflects the benign, standard nature of the code, consistent with all the reports.",
