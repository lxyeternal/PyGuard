{
  "purpose": "This code defines the module metadata and handles dynamic import of submodules for 'prometheus_async'. It also provides a way to retrieve the package version.",
  "sources": "Reading of the module's own metadata (__title__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__), import statements, and the __getattr__ function which calls importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "The only external data access occurs within __getattr__, which calls version('prometheus-async').",
  "flows": "If an attribute other than '__version__' is accessed, an AttributeError is raised. If '__version__' is requested, it fetches the version from package metadata, which is safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The dynamic import handling and version retrieval are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module metadata, handles optional imports, and implements a dynamic attribute getter for version info. The try-except block for importing 'tx' ensures optional functionality without failure if not present. The __getattr__ method provides version info on demand, using importlib.metadata, which is a safe and standard approach. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer and metadata provider. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
