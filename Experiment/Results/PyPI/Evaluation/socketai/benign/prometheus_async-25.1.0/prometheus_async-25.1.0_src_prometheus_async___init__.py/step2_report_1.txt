  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard package initialization (__init__.py) for 'prometheus_async'.\n- The code imports local submodules (.aio and optionally .tx), manages package metadata, and implements a __getattr__ method to dynamically retrieve the package version via importlib.metadata.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across all reports.\n- The code uses common patterns for optional dependencies and version retrieval, with proper exception handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or external data sources are present.\n- The use of __getattr__ for version info is standard and safe.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 or very low (0.1), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence levels are 1.0, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute access, which is standard but sometimes misused. However, in this context, it is used solely for retrieving version info, which is safe.\n- The import of importlib.metadata.version is safe; no external or untrusted data is involved.\n- The try-except block for optional import of 'tx' is handled properly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No anomalies, malicious indicators, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\nThis code is a typical, benign package initialization module with no security concerns.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe __init__.py for a Python package, with no signs of malware or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
