{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package initialization file for 'prometheus_async', meant to organize and expose submodules for asynchronous Prometheus metrics handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.aio and .tx) and the importlib.metadata for retrieving version information.",
  "sinks": "The only potentially risky sink is the dynamic retrieval of version information via importlib.metadata, which is safe and standard.",
  "flows": "Imports from local submodules, and conditional import of 'tx'. The __getattr__ function fetches package version when __version__ attribute is requested.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. Use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute access is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata, manages imports, and implements a dynamic attribute for retrieving version info. It handles missing modules gracefully. No external data sources, no network activity, and no execution of untrusted code. The structure and content follow typical Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs safe imports and provides a version attribute dynamically. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
