{
  "purpose": "This code defines the metadata and imports for the 'prometheus_async' Python package, managing optional imports and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own package metadata (__title__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__), and attempts to import submodules (.aio and .tx). It also retrieves the package version dynamically via importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily initializes module attributes and imports submodules, with a dynamic attribute getter for version info.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __getattr__ to dynamically retrieve version info is standard practice; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets package metadata, performs conditional imports, and provides dynamic version access. It does not contain any code that accepts untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate system resources maliciously. The try-except block for importing 'tx' is standard for optional dependencies. The __getattr__ function is straightforward for version retrieval and does not include malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and adheres to common packaging patterns.",
