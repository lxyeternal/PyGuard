{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures the 'prometheus_async' package, setting up imports and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.aio and .tx), and importlib.metadata.version for retrieving package version.",
  "sinks": "The version function could be a sink if exploited to access untrusted or manipulated package data, but in this context, it is used for metadata retrieval.",
  "flows": "When an attribute other than '__version__' is accessed, an AttributeError is raised; if '__version__' is requested, the version() function retrieves package version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The try-except block handles optional import gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly boilerplate for a Python package: setting module metadata, importing submodules, and dynamically retrieving version info. The import of version is standard for version retrieval. The try-except block prevents import errors if 'tx' module is missing. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely handles optional imports and provides version info. No anomalies or malicious behaviors identified.",
