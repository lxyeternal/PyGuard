  "purpose": "Service discovery for registering and deregistering services with a local Consul agent, primarily for monitoring or health check purposes.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as 'name', 'service_id', 'tags', 'token', 'metrics_server' attributes, and environmental factors influencing the code execution.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via aiohttp to localhost:8500 for service registration/deregistration; headers including optional tokens for authentication.",
  "flows": "Initialization of ConsulAgent and _LocalConsulAgentClient with parameters -> registration/deregistration methods invoke HTTP PUT requests to localhost endpoints -> optional token included in headers for authorization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets other than optional tokens, or backdoors identified. Use of '127.0.0.1' and standard Consul API endpoints are normal for local service discovery. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for interacting with a local Consul agent via HTTP API calls, using aiohttp for asynchronous network requests. Parameters for service registration such as 'name', 'service_id', 'tags', and 'token' are configurable but do not contain hardcoded secrets. The use of '127.0.0.1' and the fixed port 8500 are typical for local setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink data flows limited to local network requests for service registration/deregistration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of local service registration via Consul, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a legitimate utility for service discovery and health monitoring. No malicious signals or anomalies detected.",
