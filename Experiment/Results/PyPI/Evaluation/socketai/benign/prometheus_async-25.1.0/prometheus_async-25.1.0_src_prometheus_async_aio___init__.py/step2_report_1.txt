  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a standard Python module with some imports and conditional import logic.\n   - It imports local modules (`sd`, `_decorators`, `web`) and defines `__all__`.\n   - The only notable logic is the try-except block for importing `web`, which adds `\"web\"` to `__all__` if the import succeeds.\n   - There are no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The report indicates \"Empty response\" for all five reports, with `raw_response` being an empty string.\n   - This suggests that the reports are not providing actual code snippets or detailed findings but rather a placeholder or an error message.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports lack substantive details about the actual code or behavior.\n   - They do not specify any vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or anomalies.\n   - \"Empty response\" as a report is not informative; it could mean no issues were found, or the report failed to retrieve data.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no actual malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are demonstrated or even described, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0** because there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** as well, given the lack of any concrete issues.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities or Maliciousness:**\n   - The reports do not make any claims; they only state \"Empty response.\"\n   - Therefore, no assumptions are being made about vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the absence of any evidence, assigning non-zero scores would be unreasonable.\n   - The report appears to be either incomplete or a placeholder.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code itself appears standard and benign.\n   - The only conditional import pattern is common and not suspicious.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports lack substantive content. Based on the provided code snippet and the nature of the reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nRequest more detailed reports or actual code snippets to perform a meaningful security review.",
