{
  "purpose": "The code provides asyncio-related utility functions and conditionally imports a web module if available, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.sd, ._decorators, .web if available). No external data sources or untrusted inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and sets __all__, with no data flow or processing logic involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard import patterns and conditional import logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining asyncio utilities and optionally importing a web module. There are no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no additional context, which suggests external or environmental issues rather than code-based vulnerabilities. The code itself is benign, and no security issues are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be zero, as there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, benign, and free of malicious behavior. The 'Empty response' reports are likely unrelated to the code's security posture, possibly caused by external factors or reporting errors. No action or concern is warranted based on the current data.",
