  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external input/output involved",
  "flows": "Import from _decorators module, then re-export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with licensing comments and import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports decorators from a local module and re-exports them. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The import source is internal, typical for package structure. The code is transparent and standard, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
