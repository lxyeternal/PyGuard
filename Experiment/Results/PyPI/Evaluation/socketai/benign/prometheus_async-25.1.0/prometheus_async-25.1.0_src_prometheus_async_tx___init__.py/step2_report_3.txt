  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is straightforward, importing decorators from a local module and re-exporting them.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code only re-exports decorators.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the import from a local module is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; simple import and export pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior; the code is purely structural.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the code only imports and re-exports decorators.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero.\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk score is minimal, reflecting the benign nature. The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the lack of active processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; straightforward import/export.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. Report 4's slightly higher score (0.1) is reasonable, reflecting minimal inherent risk in import-only modules.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores are consistent and justified.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n- **Given the code snippet and reports, the overall risk remains very low, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for minimal concern, as in report 4)\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the detailed analysis.",
