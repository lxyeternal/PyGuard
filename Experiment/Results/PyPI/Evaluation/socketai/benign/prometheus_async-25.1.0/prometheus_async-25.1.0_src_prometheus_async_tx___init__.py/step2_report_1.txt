  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   The code is a straightforward module that imports decorators from a local module `_decorators` and re-exports them via `__all__`. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external inputs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports consistently describe the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. They correctly identify that the code is simply re-exporting functions and includes licensing info. No logical flaws are apparent in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.  \n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1, which is acceptable considering the minimal exposure.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n   None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score. The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic or external interactions. Therefore, high scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since no malicious activity or suspicious behavior is detected, malware scores should remain at 0. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report could be considered a slight overestimation but is acceptable given the context (importing from a local module).\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions about the imported `_decorators` module. They acknowledge that potential risks could originate there but do not speculate beyond the provided code snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report assigns high risk or malware scores unjustifiably.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, with no need for adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal risk due to import structure, but 0 is more accurate)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate.",
