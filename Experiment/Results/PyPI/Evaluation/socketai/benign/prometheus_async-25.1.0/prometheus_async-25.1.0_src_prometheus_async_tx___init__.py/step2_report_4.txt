  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific decorators from a local module `_decorators` and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- The code contains only licensing comments, import statements, and an export list.\n- No executable logic, data processing, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The import source `_decorators` is internal, which is typical for a package structure; without the implementation, potential risks are unknown but cannot be inferred from this snippet.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is simple, non-executable, and does not process untrusted data.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - **malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n  - **obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.  \n  - **securityRisk:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, even a small 0.1 seems slightly overcautious but not unreasonable.  \n  - **confidence:** All are 1.0, which is justified given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score is very low (0 or 0.1). Since the code is just re-exporting decorators, the risk is minimal. The 0.1 assigned in one report is slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports mention that the actual implementation of the imported decorators is not shown. If those functions contain malicious code, that could be a concern, but from this snippet alone, no such issues are visible.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 to 0.1 (the assigned 0.1 in one report is acceptable but slightly conservative)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, considering just import/export of safe functions)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
