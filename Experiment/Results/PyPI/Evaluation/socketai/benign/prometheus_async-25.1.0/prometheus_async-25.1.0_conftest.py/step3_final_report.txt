{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing fixtures, mock classes, and utility functions for metrics collection and timing, primarily used in a test environment for performance measurement and mocking dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries, optional 'twisted' module, and prometheus_client registry; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code sets up mock objects and patches timers; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for testing metrics and timing functions, including conditional imports, registry resets, and timer patching. It contains no external communication, no handling of untrusted input, and no malicious payloads. The functions and classes serve purely for mocking and performance measurement within a controlled test environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing and mocking purposes, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
