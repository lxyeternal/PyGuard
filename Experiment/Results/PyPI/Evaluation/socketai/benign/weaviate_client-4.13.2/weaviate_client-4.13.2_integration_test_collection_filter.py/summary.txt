  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by the testing nature and use of timing functions. The assessments across all reports are consistent with the code's behavior."
