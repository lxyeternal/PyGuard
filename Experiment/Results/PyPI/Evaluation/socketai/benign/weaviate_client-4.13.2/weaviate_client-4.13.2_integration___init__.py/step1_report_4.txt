  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and function parameters; it also accesses local files and possibly network resources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, writing to files, executing system commands, and handling sensitive data like credentials or tokens.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and input parameters flow into functions which may process or transmit data, possibly reaching network sockets or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution functions, hardcoded strings that resemble credentials, or obscure obfuscation patterns, but none are explicitly identified here.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard imports and function definitions. No obvious malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are visible. It processes data securely and does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No external communication or malicious activity appears evident from the given snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or security risks detected.",
