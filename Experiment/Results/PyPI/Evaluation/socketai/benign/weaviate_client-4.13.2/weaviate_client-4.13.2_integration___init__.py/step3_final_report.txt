{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Presence of dynamic execution (`exec`/`eval`), hardcoded secrets, environment variables, network calls, and obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through dynamic execution, network communication, or environment variables that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment variables feed into dynamic execution or network calls; suspicious code patterns increase risk.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, and unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.8), dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating malicious or suspicious intent. Network calls are present but not confirmed malicious; benign code shows no such patterns. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The overall risk is elevated in the suspicious code, while benign code remains low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3's high obfuscation and malware scores are justified by the suspicious patterns. Other reports are appropriately scored as benign. The overall threat level is moderate, with the primary concern centered on Report 3. No adjustments needed; scores align with the analysis.",
