  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility for demonstrating basic Python functionality or possibly a placeholder for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present in the code; there are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data reads identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not present; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since no sources or sinks are explicitly used in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of minimal, clear Python statements with no input handling, no external dependencies invoked dynamically, and no suspicious behaviors. It does not contain any code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. The simplicity indicates a benign intent and no signs of malicious code or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and safe to use. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
