  "purpose": "This code is used to define the setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply invokes setup() if run as the main module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it within a main guard. This is a standard pattern for Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behavior. The code is clean, simple, and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
