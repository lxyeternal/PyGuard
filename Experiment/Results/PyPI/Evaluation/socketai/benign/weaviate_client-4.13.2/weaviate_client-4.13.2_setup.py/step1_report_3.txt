{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statement and the '__main__' block that calls setup().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function may process package metadata and files but does not directly lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Importing setuptools and executing setup() if the script is run as main forms the flow; no untrusted data or user input flows through this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and invokes the setup() function when executed directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious imports, or obfuscated code. The setup() function is a standard method to prepare package installation. There are no suspicious data flows, and no external inputs or outputs are involved beyond standard package setup. The simplicity and standard structure reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
