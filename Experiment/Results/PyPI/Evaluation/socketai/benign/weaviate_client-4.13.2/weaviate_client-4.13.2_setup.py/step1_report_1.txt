{
  "purpose": "To facilitate package installation by invoking setuptools' setup function.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from 'setuptools'. No input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls 'setup()' when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for Python packaging. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function and invokes it if run as the main module. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts. It does not include any malicious code, hidden behaviors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical packaging practices. No source-to-sink data flow, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script used for Python package installation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
