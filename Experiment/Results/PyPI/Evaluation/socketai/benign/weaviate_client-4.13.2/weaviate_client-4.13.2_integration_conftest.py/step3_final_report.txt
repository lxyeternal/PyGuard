  "purpose": "Fixtures for managing Weaviate clients and collections, including environment variable handling for API keys, with proper cleanup procedures.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_APIKEY), function parameters for collection and client creation, collection name sanitization.",
  "sinks": "Use of environment variables for API keys; no direct data leaks or network activity; no suspicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables flow into headers for API authentication; collection creation/deletion flows are straightforward; no malicious data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no backdoors or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up test fixtures for Weaviate clients and collections, utilizing environment variables for API keys, with proper resource cleanup. It employs standard practices without obfuscation or malicious payloads. The use of environment variables is typical for secret management, and no suspicious data flows or code anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles secrets securely via environment variables, performs proper cleanup, and contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
