  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data fetching is present.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code constructs are identified.\n- Dependencies are version-restricted and related to code styling and type annotations.\n- The package metadata and configuration are standard and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n   - The code only performs package setup using setuptools, with static data.\n\n2. **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:**\n   - No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code is clear, readable, and typical of an open-source setup script.\n\n3. **Flow and data handling:**\n   - The flow is static, with no untrusted data or runtime external inputs.\n   - No external network or file operations beyond standard package installation.\n\n4. **Scores justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n   - Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential issues or anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code's purpose is solely package configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided reports. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the nature of the code.",
