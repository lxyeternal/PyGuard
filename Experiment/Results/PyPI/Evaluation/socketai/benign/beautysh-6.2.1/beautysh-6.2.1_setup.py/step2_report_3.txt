  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It contains static package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data fetching.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or anomalies.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any dynamic code.\n- The only slight concern could be the use of `setup()` which, if misused, could cause issues during package installation, but in this context, it is standard.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, benign package setup script.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low risk, just considering the potential for package misconfiguration, but nothing malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with their assessments.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
