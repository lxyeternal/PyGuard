  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the Python package 'beautysh', used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data inputs; the script does not process user input or external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The flow is static; no runtime data flows from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools, defining package information, dependencies, and entry points. It contains only static data and no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or user input handling. The dependencies are version-restricted and related to styling and type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The script's purpose is solely to facilitate package installation and distribution, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are consistent with its straightforward nature. It is safe for use in production environments.",
