  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear description; input from files/stdin, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Output to stdout/files; diff output to stderr; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, no malicious code constructs.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a straightforward regex-based Bash beautifier. It handles function style detection, indentation, multiline strings, here-docs, comments, etc., all within standard Python libraries. No signs of malicious behavior—no external calls, no data leaks, no obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured utility. Malware score: 0. Justification: No malicious activity or suspicious code detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar in scope and findings to Report 1. Focuses on static text processing, uses regex, no external system calls or malicious patterns. The use of external libraries is standard.\n- Malware score: 0. Justification: No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same conclusion: a legitimate code formatter with standard regex parsing, safe file handling, no external network activity.\n- Malware score: 0. Justification: No signs of malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Consistent with previous assessments. Focused on formatting, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0. Justification: No malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also confirms the script is a Bash beautifier, with no suspicious code, no external network activity, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0. Justification: Clear, safe utility.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a standard Bash beautifier based on regex parsing and formatting.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; the script performs file I/O and string processing only.\n- **Functionality & logic:** Consistent, standard, and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, a low risk score of **0.1** or **0** is appropriate. Since the reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, I would recommend **0.1** for a conservative but justified low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimated scores:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**           | No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.                          |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**           | Code is straightforward, regex-based, and well-structured.                                |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1**         | Very low; standard file I/O, no external network, no backdoors, no data exfiltration.    |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and all point toward a benign, well-implemented code formatting utility with no security concerns.",
