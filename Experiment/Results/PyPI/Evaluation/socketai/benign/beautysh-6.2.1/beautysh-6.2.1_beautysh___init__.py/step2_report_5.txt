  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a Bash beautifier, using regex for function style detection, indentation, and formatting. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on standard open-source libraries, and its purpose is purely formatting.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with a benign formatting tool.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code is benign and designed solely for code formatting.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe file handling, regex-based parsing, and no malicious behavior. Uses external libraries for version info and color output but nothing suspicious.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with a safe utility.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious or obfuscated elements; the analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a legitimate Bash beautifier, with no signs of malicious activity. It handles input/output safely, uses standard libraries, and performs static code formatting.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — very low.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1 — absolute confidence based on the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is thorough and correct; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a safe, standard code formatting utility with no malicious activity, network operations, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, consistent with a benign formatting tool.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing safe file handling, regex-based formatting, no malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0 — aligns well.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident risks.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior. It’s a standard code formatter.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct given the code’s transparency and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the detailed reports and the code’s nature, I concur with the assessments. The code is a straightforward, open-source style formatting utility with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, standard utility with minimal security considerations)\n\n**Note:** The minor risk score reflects the fact that, as with any code that handles files and user input, there’s always a minimal inherent risk if misused, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The supply chain security risk for this dependency is negligible. The code is safe, well-structured, and designed solely for formatting Bash scripts.",
