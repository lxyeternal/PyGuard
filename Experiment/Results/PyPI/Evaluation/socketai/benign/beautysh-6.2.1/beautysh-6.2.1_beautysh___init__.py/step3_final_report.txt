{
  "purpose": "A Bash beautifier for formatting and reindenting Bash shell scripts using regex-based parsing and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files or stdin; processes code lines for indentation, function style, comments, here-docs, multiline strings, and control structures.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted code to files or stdout; diff output to stderr; no external network or system calls involved.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from file or stdin through regex-based transformations and indentation logic, resulting in formatted output; no external data flows or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and regex for static text processing; no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious external activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, regex-driven Bash script formatter. It detects function styles, manages indentation levels, handles multiline strings, here-docs, comments, and control structures. It performs file I/O safely, employs colorized diff output, and offers command-line options for style enforcement. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system activity are present. The logic is consistent, and the implementation aligns with typical code formatting tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured Bash beautifier with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe utility designed solely for code formatting purposes.",
