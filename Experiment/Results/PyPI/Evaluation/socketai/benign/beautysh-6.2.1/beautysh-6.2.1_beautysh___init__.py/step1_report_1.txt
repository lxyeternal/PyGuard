  "purpose": "The script functions as a Bash script beautifier, reformatting shell scripts for improved readability and style consistency.",
  "sources": "Input is read from files specified via command-line arguments or stdin; no other data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to stdout or files, and diff display uses sys.stderr. No sinks that handle untrusted data are evident beyond file I/O and console output.",
  "flows": "Input files -> read_file or sys.stdin.read -> beautify_string processing -> write_file or sys.stdout.write. No untrusted data flows into sensitive system commands or external processes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code mainly involves regex-based text processing, which is standard for formatting tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Bash beautifier. It employs regex to detect and modify function declaration styles and indentation, with configurable options for style enforcement and formatting. The logic involves parsing and reformatting source code lines, handling special constructs like here-documents and multiline strings. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code relies on open-source libraries (argparse, re, os, sys, pkg_resources, colorama) in a typical manner. The functions for diffing and colorized output are purely for user interface. No external system calls, network communication, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for code formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It does not include any backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity. Its sole purpose is code beautification, with standard safety practices.",
