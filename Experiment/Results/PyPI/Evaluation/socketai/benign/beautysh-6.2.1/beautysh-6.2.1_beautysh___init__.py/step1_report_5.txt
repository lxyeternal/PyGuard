{
  "purpose": "The script is a Bash script beautifier written in Python, aimed at reformatting Bash scripts for improved readability and consistency.",
  "sources": "User-provided file inputs via command-line arguments, stdin if '-' is specified.",
  "sinks": "File write operations for beautified output; potential overwriting of files; diff display output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from specified files or stdin; processed through beautify_string; output written back to files or stdout; diff display optionally colored.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no use of dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets. Regex-based detection for function styles is standard. No network operations, no suspicious domain connections, and no system commands outside Python standard modules are observed. The code includes comprehensive string processing and diff display but no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file reading, string processing, and formatting without executing or including code that could be malicious. No external network connections, system modifications, or hidden backdoors are present. The regex patterns and string manipulations are used for code formatting purposes only. The command-line argument handling and versioning are typical for CLI tools. The code maintains security best practices, with no evident points for injection, data leaks, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a Bash script beautifier with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs legitimate file formatting tasks without executing arbitrary code or exfiltrating data. Overall, it appears safe and free from malware or security risks.",
