  "purpose": "A Bash script beautifier that formats shell scripts for readability and consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files specified in command-line arguments or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted output to files or stdout; outputs diffs to stderr; reads environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from files or stdin -> processing functions -> output files or stdout. Environment variables influence color output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Uses regex for code manipulation, which is typical for formatting tools. No suspicious network activity or harmful system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs syntax detection, string manipulation, and formatting for Bash scripts, including handling function styles, indentation, comments, and here-documents. It uses standard libraries such as argparse, re, os, and pkg_resources, with no evidence of code injection, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration. All file I/O operations appear to be straightforward reading/writing files or stdin/stdout, with optional backup creation. No network operations, reverse shells, or unauthorized data access code is present. The code’s structure is consistent with a formatting utility, with no suspicious logic or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bash script beautifier with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It solely performs code formatting tasks with standard practices. No malware or security risks are evident.",
