  "purpose": "Import a module named 'agatedbf.table', likely for data handling or table operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source that loads external code or library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no data flows or outputs are explicitly shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is identifiable in this isolated code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only importing a module without further actions; no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import of the 'agatedbf.table' module. No further logic, data handling, or input/output operations are present. The module appears to be a third-party dependency. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. The code itself does not demonstrate any malicious behavior or security issues.",
