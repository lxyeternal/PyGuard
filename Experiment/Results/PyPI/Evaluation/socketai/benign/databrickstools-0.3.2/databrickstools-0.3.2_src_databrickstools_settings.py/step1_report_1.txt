{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variables and configuration parameters for a Databricks tools module, including logging setup and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_URL, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_TOKEN, DATABRICKSTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL, and others.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables are used to assign sensitive data like URLs and tokens; the databricks_environment_check function raises exceptions if critical variables are missing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read into constants; the check function validates presence of URL and token, raising exceptions if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials are clearly marked as defaults, not secrets. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads environment variables with defaults, configures logging levels, and checks for required environment variables. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The only security-related logic is environment validation which is standard practice. No suspicious data flows or backdoors detected. The defaults are placeholders and do not contain secrets. No network communication or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a Databricks tools module. It manages environment variables securely with defaults, performs validation, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe from a security standpoint.",
