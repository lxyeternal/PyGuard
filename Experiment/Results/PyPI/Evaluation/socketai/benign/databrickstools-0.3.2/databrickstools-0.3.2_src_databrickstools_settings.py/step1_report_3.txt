  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages environment variables for configuring access to a Databricks environment, including URLs, tokens, and configuration flags.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_URL, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_TOKEN, and others using os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; environment variables are used for configuration, not for executing untrusted code or data",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond placeholder defaults, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from environment variables, some with default values, and performs validation checks on critical variables. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The environment variable access and validation are standard practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup for a Databricks-related application. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It securely handles environment variables and performs basic validation.",
