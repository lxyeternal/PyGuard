{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to initialize configuration variables from environment variables and perform a check to ensure critical environment variables are set for connecting to Databricks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_URL, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TAG_TOKEN, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_URL, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TOKEN, DATABRICKSTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DEFAULT_OVERWRITE_FLAG, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DEFAULT_FORMAT, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DEFAULT_FILE_ENDING.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or files; it primarily reads environment variables for configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start and used to set internal variables. The environment check function raises exceptions if critical variables are missing.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets default values for environment variables using hardcoded strings, which could potentially be sensitive info if misused, but are placeholders here. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes configuration from environment variables, including URLs, tokens, and settings. It performs a validation check to ensure essential variables are present. There is no suspicious logic, no data exfiltration, or malicious commands. No use of external libraries beyond standard logging and os. The default values are placeholder strings, typical for configuration, and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for connecting to Databricks, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It handles environment variables securely, assuming proper environment management outside the code. No signs of malware or malicious behavior detected.",
