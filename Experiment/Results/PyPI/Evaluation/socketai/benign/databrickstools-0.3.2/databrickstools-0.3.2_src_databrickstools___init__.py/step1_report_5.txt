{
  "purpose": "Module import and export declarations, likely part of a package's __init__.py file to expose specific functions and variables.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .core import main' indicates reading from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external network or data output is present.",
  "flows": "The import from '.core' to 'main' is straightforward and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a 'main' function from a local 'core' module and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communication. The structure and syntax are typical for Python package __init__.py files. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package interface setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
