  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard Python module import/export patterns.\n- No untrusted data sources, no data flows, no external communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent with high confidence (1), which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- The code **does** import `main` from a local `.core` module.\n- It **defines** an `__all__` list exposing certain symbols, including `'main'`, `'databricks'`, `'markdown'`, `'settings'`.\n- There are **no** data processing, network calls, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's `__init__.py` or similar, setting up module exports.\n\n### Error or flaw identification:\n- No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The confidence scores are 1, justified by the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern, raising scores above 0.5 would be unreasonable.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n- The import from `.core` is relative but typical; no external or untrusted input involved.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The uniformity across reports suggests consensus on benignity.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No additional security measures are necessary for this code.",
