{
  "purpose": "Module export definition for a Python package, exposing certain components including 'main' and others like 'databricks', 'markdown', and 'settings'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.core' and the list '__all__' declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks related to untrusted data or external data flow; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code simply imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The import is relative but common in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function or object from a local module '.core'. It then declares '__all__' to specify public API components, including 'databricks', 'markdown', 'settings', and 'main'. There are no conditional logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and serves as an API export configuration, typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
