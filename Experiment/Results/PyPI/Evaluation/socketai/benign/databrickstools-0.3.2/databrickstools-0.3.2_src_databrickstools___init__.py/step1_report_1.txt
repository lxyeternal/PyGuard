{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and imports a main function from a core module, likely part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'main' function from a local core module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing involving untrusted input or external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a local module and declares public API elements. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or include any suspicious logic. The structure is typical for Python modules preparing exports. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident. The code's simplicity suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module interface with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
