{
  "purpose": "This code defines an import statement and an export list for a Python module, likely intended to expose specific functions or classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.core' to import 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import of 'main' in '.core' to the export list '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup: it imports 'main' from a relative module '.core' and defines an export list '__all__' with several string entries, including 'main'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no potential malicious behaviors. The structure is typical for Python modules intending to control namespace exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a simple module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
