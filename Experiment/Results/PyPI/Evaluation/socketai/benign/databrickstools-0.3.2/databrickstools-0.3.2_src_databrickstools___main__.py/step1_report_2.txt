{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'core' module and the 'main' function from it.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main() potentially executes untrusted or arbitrary code within that function.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'main' from 'core' to executing main(), which may perform various actions depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns. The simplicity suggests standard module execution without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function 'main' from a local module 'core' and executes it immediately. Without knowledge of the 'core' module's content, it is not possible to determine whether 'main' performs malicious actions. The code structure itself is typical for entry points in Python applications. No external input or environment variables are directly used here, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point calling 'main' from a local module. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. However, the safety depends entirely on what the 'main' function does within the 'core' module. Based solely on this fragment, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
