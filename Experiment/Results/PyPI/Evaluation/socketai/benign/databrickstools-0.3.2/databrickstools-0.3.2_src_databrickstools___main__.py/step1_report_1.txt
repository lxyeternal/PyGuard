{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a main function from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly; it calls a function imported from a module.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() could potentially be a sink if it executes malicious code, but no untrusted data is directly involved.",
  "flows": "Import from .core -> call main() -> executes code within main()",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs. The only concern is the content of core.main, which is not provided.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named main from a local module and executes it immediately. Without the implementation of core.main, it is impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The code itself is standard and does not contain suspicious constructs. The minimal nature of this snippet does not provide evidence of malicious intent, but relies heavily on the contents of core.main.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there are no overt signs of malicious behavior. However, the actual security risk depends entirely on the implementation of core.main. As it stands, the code appears benign.",
