  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from the local core module",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from a local module named 'core'",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main() as a function call potentially executes untrusted code from the 'core' module",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import 'main' and execute it immediately",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs, are present",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function named 'main' from a local module and executes it. There are no visible parameters, conditional logic, or additional code. The security and behavior depend entirely on the contents of the 'core' module's 'main' function. Without inspecting 'core', we cannot determine if 'main()' performs malicious actions, reads untrusted input, or accesses sensitive data. The code is minimal and typical for script entry points. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward entry point that runs the 'main' function from the local 'core' module. Its security posture cannot be fully assessed without inspecting the 'core' module, but the snippet itself appears benign and typical for Python applications.",
