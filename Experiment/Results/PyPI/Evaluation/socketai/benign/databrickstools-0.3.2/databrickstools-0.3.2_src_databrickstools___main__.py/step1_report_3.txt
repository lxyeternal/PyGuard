{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and runs a local function.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the main() function, which may contain its own sinks, but from this snippet alone, no direct sink is present.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to calling main() from core, with no evident untrusted data sources in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports and executes main() from a local module. There are no visible data inputs, external network interactions, or suspicious code structures. Since the snippet is minimal, its behavior entirely depends on the implementation of core.main(), which is not provided. Without further context, no malicious activity or security risks can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward invocation of a main function from a local module, typical for Python scripts.",
