  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point executing core.main(), which depends on external implementation.",
  "sources": "Import of .core and call to main()",
  "sinks": "Potential execution within core.main(), but no direct untrusted data handling in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import -> main() execution; actual flow depends on core.main() implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code imports and executes core.main(), with no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets. The security implications depend entirely on core.main's content, which is unknown. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the code itself appears benign. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the low security risk scores reflect the minimal code and uncertainty about core.main. Confidence in benign nature is high, but the actual risk hinges on external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard Python entry point with no evident malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible based solely on this code. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
