{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and methods for interacting with the Databricks API to manage workspace files, import code, and export notebooks in various formats.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment variables for tokens, method parameters for file paths, and file contents read from disk during import functions.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Databricks API endpoints for listing, creating directories, importing, and exporting files; also writes file content to local disk during export.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens and file contents are used in HTTP requests (sinks) triggered by method calls (sources). The import functions encode content in base64 for API submission; export functions decode base64 responses and write to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding/decoding without additional validation, direct use of tokens in HTTP headers, and file content reading and writing are standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API tokens through parameters and does not contain hardcoded secrets. The base64 encoding is standard for data transmission. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or backdoors are present. The code primarily interacts with the Databricks API for workspace management. No signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration are evident. The functions follow typical API usage patterns and file operations. Overall, it appears to be legitimate functionality for Databricks workspace automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides legitimate API interaction functions for Databricks workspace management without evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles data encoding/decoding and uses secure request headers with tokens supplied at runtime. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.",
