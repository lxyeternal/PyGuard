{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python API client for managing Databricks workspace files and directories, including import/export, listing, and creation functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from file contents (import functions), API responses (export functions), and external parameters such as tokens and paths.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP requests to Databricks API endpoints; writes exported content to local files.",
  "flows": "Source data (file content or API response) is encoded (base64) and sent via POST requests; data from API responses is decoded and saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard base64 encoding; no suspicious code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper utilizing requests to interact with Databricks workspace endpoints. It encodes file contents in base64 for import, decodes for export, and manages directory listing and creation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, are present. The token is handled externally, which is typical. The base64 encoding is standard for data transfer, not malicious. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Databricks workspace management with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, mainly reflecting external token handling, but does not indicate any malicious intent.",
