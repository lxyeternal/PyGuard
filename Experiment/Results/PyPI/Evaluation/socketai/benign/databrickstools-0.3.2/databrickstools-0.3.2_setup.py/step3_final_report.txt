  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'databrickstools', defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and scripts.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; 'entry_points' and 'scripts' reference external scripts but do not execute untrusted code within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Package setup parameters -> CLI entry point 'databrickstools=databrickstools:main' -> references local script 'bin/databrickstools'.",
  "anomalies": "References a local script 'bin/databrickstools' in 'scripts' parameter; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected in the setup script itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and defines CLI entry points. No dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted data processing are present. The 'scripts' field points to a local script, which could contain malicious code, but its content is not provided here. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The code aligns with standard practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1) due to the external script reference, which cannot be evaluated here but does not indicate malicious intent within this script. No changes are necessary.",
