  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It reads the README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms a typical setup script with no suspicious activity. The 'entry_points' and 'scripts' are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward setup script, no suspicious code or anomalies. The 'scripts' parameter points to a local script, but without its content, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup with CLI entry point, no signs of malicious activity. The 'main' function in 'databrickstools' module is called, but its content isn't evaluated here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.1). The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected, but the mention of the 'scripts' pointing to a local script warrants caution if that script is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, given the cautious note.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scripts and entry points are standard, and no suspicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the setup scripts are standard and do not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code provided is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor point is the 'scripts' parameter referencing a local script ('bin/databrickstools'). To fully assess security, the content of that script should be reviewed separately, but within this setup script, no malicious activity is present.\n\n### Estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect cautious acknowledgment of the external script reference, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The setup code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
