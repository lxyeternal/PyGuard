  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1) due to the external script reference, which cannot be evaluated here but does not indicate malicious intent within this script. No changes are necessary."
