  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for managing file import/export and directory operations on Databricks, utilizing environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials (DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TOKEN, URL, etc.), user input paths, imported API classes.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Databricks via imported classes, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "User input paths and options flow into API method calls, with credentials supplied via environment variables, leading to network API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for Databricks file operations, relying on external modules for API interactions. It uses environment variables for sensitive data, which is standard. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious flows are present. The use of 'getattr' for dynamic method calls is controlled and typical. The code structure is clear, with proper logging and error handling. No signs of malicious intent or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI tool for managing files and directories on Databricks. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to credential handling, which is standard practice. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
