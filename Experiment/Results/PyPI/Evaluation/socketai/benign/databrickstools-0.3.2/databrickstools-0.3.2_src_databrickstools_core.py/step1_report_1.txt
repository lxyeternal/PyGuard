{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for importing and exporting files to and from Databricks, as well as managing directories on Databricks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables imported from .settings (DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_TOKEN, DATABRICKSTOOLS_DATABRICKS_URL, etc.), user input parameters for file paths, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods within DatabricksImporter and DatabricksExporter objects, logging statements.",
  "flows": "User input (file paths, operation types) flow into methods that construct API calls to Databricks via imported classes, which then perform network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no signs of malicious code such as dynamic code execution, system modification, or network exfiltration. Usage of environment variables for tokens is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for sensitive credentials, which is common for configuration management. The main functions are for importing/exporting files via Databricks API, with logging for success/failure. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only external interactions are network requests to Databricks, which is expected. No code injection, reverse shells, or system modifications are observed. The code is well-structured, and all external inputs are parameters or environment variables, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI for managing files on Databricks. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on environment variables for credentials, which is typical and not suspicious. Overall, it is safe with respect to supply chain or runtime security risks.",
