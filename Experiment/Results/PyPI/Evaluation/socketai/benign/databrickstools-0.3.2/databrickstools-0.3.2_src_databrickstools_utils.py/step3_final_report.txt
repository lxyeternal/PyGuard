  "purpose": "A decorator that serializes the output of a function to JSON with pretty printing, primarily for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The function's return value, which is serialized via json.dumps using a default serializer accessing __dict__.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs to stdout; error logs via logger.error.",
  "flows": "Function executes, returns an object; the wrapper serializes this object and prints it, with error handling for serialization issues.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __dict__ as default serializer, which could expose internal object attributes; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward debugging utility that serializes function output to JSON, with optional custom serializer and error logging. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The use of __dict__ could potentially expose sensitive internal attributes, but this is a common debugging pattern and not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The error handling is standard, and the code structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility with no malicious or suspicious activity. The potential exposure of internal object attributes via __dict__ is a minor concern but not a security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal exposure risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for debugging purposes.",
