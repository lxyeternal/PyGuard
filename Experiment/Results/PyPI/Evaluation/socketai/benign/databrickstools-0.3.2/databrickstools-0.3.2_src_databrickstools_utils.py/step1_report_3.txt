  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to pretty-print the JSON serialization of the output of a function, with optional custom serialization.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (*args, **kwargs), and the function's return value (serializable_obj).",
  "sinks": "json.dumps serialization, logger.error logging, and print output.",
  "flows": "Function call -> wrapper -> serializable_obj -> json.dumps -> print; errors -> logger.error",
  "anomalies": "Use of default serializer function which accesses __dict__, potential for unintentional exposure if object contains sensitive attributes, no validation or sanitization of output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that serializes a function's output to JSON and prints it, with error handling for serialization issues. The use of a default serializer that accesses __dict__ could inadvertently expose private or sensitive object attributes if present. No external inputs are processed directly; the code relies on function outputs and a logger, both of which are standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for debugging or logging purposes without any external data leakage, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for pretty-printing function outputs as JSON, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
