{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for pretty-printing the JSON serialization of the output of a function, mainly for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the function it decorates when invoked; specifically, it serializes the return value of the function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output via print, and logs errors through a logger object; no data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Function is called → decorated function executes → its return value is serialized into JSON → printed to stdout or logged if error occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a default serializer function (`serializer_function`) that defaults to accessing `__dict__` could potentially be exploited if the function returns objects with malicious `__dict__` modifications, but this is standard for debugging. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order decorator that wraps a function to serialize its output as JSON and print it with indentation. It allows a custom serializer function, defaulting to accessing `__dict__`. Exception handling is in place to log and re-raise serialization errors. There are no network operations, no code injection, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior. Overall, this is a utility function for debugging or logging that appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward debugging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python features appropriately. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
