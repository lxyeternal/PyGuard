  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to pretty-print the output of a function by serializing it to JSON with indentation.",
  "sources": "The decorator calls the wrapped function, capturing its output (serializable_obj). It also reads the logger object passed as an argument to log errors.",
  "sinks": "The json.dumps function could potentially handle untrusted data if the input to the wrapped function is untrusted, but this does not lead to code execution or data leaks inherently. The logger.error call may leak sensitive information if the logger is misconfigured to log sensitive data, but no explicit data leakage code is present.",
  "flows": "The function flow is: wrapper calls the original function -> serializes the output -> prints the JSON string. If serialization fails, logs error and raises exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of decorators, json serialization, and error logging. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pretty_print decorator that serializes the output of a function to JSON and prints it. It uses a default serializer function that accesses __dict__ for objects. It handles TypeError exceptions during serialization by logging an error and re-raising. No external data sources, no malicious code, and no suspicious patterns are present. The use of logger assumes it is a valid logging object but does not involve security risks. The code appears safe, straightforward, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a decorator for pretty-printing function outputs in JSON format. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flow are evident.",
