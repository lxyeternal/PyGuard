{
  "purpose": "A decorator function to pretty-print the JSON serialization of the return value of another function, with optional custom serialization.",
  "sources": "The decorator function `pretty_print` and the nested `wrapper` function, which call the decorated function and serialize its output.",
  "sinks": "The `json.dumps` call, which serializes the object, and the `print` statement, which outputs the serialized JSON.",
  "flows": "The decorated function is called within `wrapper`, its output is serialized via `json.dumps`, then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard JSON serialization with error handling. The `logger` parameter is expected but not validated or sanitized, though this is normal for logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator `pretty_print` that takes a logger and an optional serializer function. The inner `wrapper` calls the decorated function, serializes its output to JSON, and prints it. Error handling logs type errors. No external data input, no unsafe operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The use of `json.dumps` with a default serializer is standard, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a pretty-print decorator for JSON output, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in this code.",
