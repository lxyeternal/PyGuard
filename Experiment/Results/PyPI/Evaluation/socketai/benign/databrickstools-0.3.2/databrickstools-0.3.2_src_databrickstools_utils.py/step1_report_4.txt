{
  "purpose": "Provide a decorator to pretty-print the output of a function in JSON format with customizable serialization.",
  "sources": "The function calls the decorated function and obtains its return value; json.dumps processes the data.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps serializes the object; print outputs the serialized data; logger.error logs errors.",
  "flows": "Function output -> json.dumps serialization -> print output; Errors in serialization -> logger.error",
  "anomalies": "Use of a default serializer function that accesses __dict__ could be exploited if an object has malicious or unexpected attributes; no direct anomalies indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that serializes function output to JSON with indentation for readability. It uses a customizable serializer that accesses __dict__, which is common for objects. The try-except block captures serialization errors and logs them. The code does not perform any network activity, file access, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident. The code is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a JSON pretty-print decorator with error logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
