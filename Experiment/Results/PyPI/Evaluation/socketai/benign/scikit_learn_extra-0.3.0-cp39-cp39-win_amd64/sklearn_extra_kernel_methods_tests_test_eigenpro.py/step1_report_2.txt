{
  "purpose": "The code provides tests for EigenProRegressor and EigenProClassifier from sklearn_extra.kernel_methods, validating parameter handling, accuracy, and robustness with various datasets.",
  "sources": "Inputs are generated via make_regression and make_classification functions, with parameters and random_state used for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data, send data over network, or execute system commands. It primarily performs data generation, model fitting, and prediction.",
  "flows": "Input data from make_regression/make_classification -> model fitting (fit) -> prediction (predict). No external sinks or data leaks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of pytest and numpy/testing does not raise concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for machine learning models, involving parameter validation, accuracy testing, and robustness checks. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious intent. All data sources and sinks are related to model training and evaluation within the test environment. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The functions and variables are descriptive and aligned with typical testing patterns. No hidden or malicious code segments identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate test suite for EigenPro models, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly validates functionality and robustness in a controlled environment.",
