{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for EigenProRegressor and EigenProClassifier models, generating synthetic datasets internally to validate parameter validation, accuracy, and robustness.",
  "sources": "Synthetic data generated via sklearn's make_regression and make_classification functions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data remains within memory during testing; no external data transmission, network activity, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from generation to model fitting and prediction, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing suite utilizing well-known libraries and functions. It performs parameter validation, accuracy checks, and robustness tests on synthetic datasets. No external dependencies or network activities are involved. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All activities are typical for unit testing ML models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing EigenPro models with synthetic data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
