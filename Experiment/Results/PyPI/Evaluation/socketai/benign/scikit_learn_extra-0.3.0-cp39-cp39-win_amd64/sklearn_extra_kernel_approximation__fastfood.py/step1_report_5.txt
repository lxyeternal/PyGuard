  "purpose": "Implement a scikit-learn transformer that approximates the feature map of an RBF kernel using the Fastfood method for efficient kernel approximation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (math, numpy, scipy, sklearn, internal cyfht function), class initialization parameters, fit method (random seed, input data), internal random number generation, data padding, and data transformation functions.",
  "sinks": "None evident. The code mainly performs mathematical operations, data padding, and feature transformations without untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data X is processed through random matrix generation, Fourier transformation, and feature mapping functions; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution. Internal functions perform standard mathematical transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for kernel approximation, leveraging mathematical and statistical libraries. It carefully enforces dimensionality constraints, uses random states for reproducibility, and performs data padding. No suspicious network operations, file I/O, or secret handling routines are present. All computations align with standard machine learning practices for feature mapping. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a known algorithm, with proper handling of randomness and data transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the Fastfood algorithm for kernel approximation. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. It strictly performs mathematical transformations for feature extraction, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
