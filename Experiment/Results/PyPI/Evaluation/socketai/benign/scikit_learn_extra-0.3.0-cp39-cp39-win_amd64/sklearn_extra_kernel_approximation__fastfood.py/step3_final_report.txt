  "purpose": "Implementation of a Fastfood-based approximation of the RBF kernel for machine learning feature transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays, random matrices generated during fit, Walsh-Hadamard transform (_cyfht.fht2).",
  "sinks": "Data flows within the process; no external data exfiltration or malicious output observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> padding -> random matrix application -> Walsh-Hadamard transform -> Fourier feature mapping -> scaling -> output features.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; use of standard libraries and transforms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical operations for kernel approximation, utilizing known algorithms and libraries. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. Random matrices and Walsh-Hadamard transforms are used as intended for the algorithm. The code structure is clear, and the external module _cyfht appears legitimate. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Fastfood kernel approximation method. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
