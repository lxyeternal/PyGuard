{
  "purpose": "The code implements EigenPro-based regression and classification models for large-scale kernel learning, utilizing eigen-decomposition, Nystrom approximation, and kernel computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X and Y for training and prediction; it also accepts parameters such as kernel type, gamma, degree, and coef0; it chooses random seed via check_random_state; it samples data indices for subsampling.",
  "sinks": "The code performs matrix computations and predictions; no direct data leaks or external network communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (X, Y) to kernel calculations, eigen decompositions, and parameter setup; model updates involve matrix operations that depend on the sampled data; predictions are computed via kernel evaluations and matrix multiplications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious network or file system operations are visible. No obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic code execution is detected. The code uses standard scientific computing libraries for legitimate kernel learning tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard eigenvalue decomposition and kernel matrix computations, with proper parameter validation. It uses random sampling for subsampling, adheres to scikit-learn API conventions, and contains no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions involve matrix calculations and model fitting/prediction, consistent with kernel methods. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of EigenPro kernel methods for regression and classification. It does not contain malicious or sabotage code. Its purpose is to provide scalable kernel learning algorithms without any hidden or harmful operations.",
