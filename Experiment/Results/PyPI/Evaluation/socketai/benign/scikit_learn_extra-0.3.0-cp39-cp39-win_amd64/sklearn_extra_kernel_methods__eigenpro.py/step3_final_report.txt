  "purpose": "Implementation of EigenPro-based kernel regression and classification methods for large-scale machine learning, utilizing eigen decomposition, kernel computations, and iterative coefficient updates.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays (X, Y), random seed for reproducibility, kernel parameters, and model hyperparameters.",
  "sinks": "Predicted outputs (Y), coefficient matrices, and internal eigen decompositions; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through kernel calculations, eigen decomposition, coefficient updates during training, and prediction steps involving kernel evaluations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard eigenpro kernel methods with proper parameter validation, eigen decomposition, and iterative training procedures. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code structure and comments indicate a legitimate scientific computing purpose. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of large-scale kernel eigenpro methods for regression and classification. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the inherent complexity but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
