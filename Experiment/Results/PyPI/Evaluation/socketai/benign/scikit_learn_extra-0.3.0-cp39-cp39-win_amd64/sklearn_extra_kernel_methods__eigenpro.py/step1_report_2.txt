{
  "purpose": "This code implements EigenPro-based regression and classification models using kernel methods for large-scale machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (X, Y), random seed from 'random_state', kernel parameters, and internal random choices for subsampling.",
  "sinks": "Predictions output via _raw_predict(), coefficient updates during training (self.coef_), and kernel computations. No explicit data leaks or external network calls are detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, Y) are processed through kernel calculations, eigen decomposition, and iterative updates of coefficients; predictions are made via kernel evaluations on new data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The code performs standard kernel regression/classification with internal numerical methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of EigenPro kernel methods for regression and classification. It carefully validates parameters, performs eigen decomposition with fallback for numerical issues, and uses random sampling for subsampling. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The use of random state ensures reproducibility. The kernel functions are standard, and the coefficient updates follow typical gradient steps for kernel methods. Overall, the code aligns with intended scientific computing tasks, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of EigenPro kernel methods for machine learning tasks, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is consistent with open-source machine learning libraries and contains no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
