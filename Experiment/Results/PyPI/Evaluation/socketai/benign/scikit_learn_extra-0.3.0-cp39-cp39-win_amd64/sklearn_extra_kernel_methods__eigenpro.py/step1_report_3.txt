  "purpose": "The code implements kernel-based regression and classification models using EigenPro iteration, aiming for scalable and efficient large-scale machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters X and Y, kernel function calculations, random state initialization, and subsample selection.",
  "sinks": "Predicted outputs in _raw_predict method, and class label predictions in predict method.",
  "flows": "Input data X and Y flow into parameter validation and initialization, then through kernel computations, eigen decomposition, and iterative coefficient updates. During prediction, data flows through kernel calculations and coefficient multiplication to produce outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling observed. Kernel computations rely on standard scikit-learn functions. No network communication, file access, or system modifications detected. Parameter validation is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of kernel eigenpro methods for regression and classification, with careful parameter validation, standard kernel calculations, eigen decomposition via scikit-learn's eigh, and iterative coefficient updates for model fitting. Random states are managed via scikit-learn's check_random_state. The data flows from inputs, through kernel computations and eigen decompositions, to coefficient updates during training, and to predictions via kernel evaluations. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears well-structured, using standard practices, and focuses solely on model training and prediction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented machine learning model based on EigenPro kernels. No malicious or sabotage elements are detected. The code is benign and serves a legitimate purpose for large-scale kernel learning. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious network/system access.",
