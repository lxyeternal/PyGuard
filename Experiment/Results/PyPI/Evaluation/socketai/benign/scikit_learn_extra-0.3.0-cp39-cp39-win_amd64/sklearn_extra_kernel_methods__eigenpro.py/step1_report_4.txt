  "purpose": "Implementations of EigenPro kernel methods for regression and classification, providing fast kernel learning algorithms with large-scale data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X and labels Y, kernel parameters, and random seed. Uses data from function arguments and internal random state.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include model coefficients and predictions. No direct data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (X, Y) -> Kernel computation and eigen decomposition -> Model training updates -> Prediction outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious variables. Code uses standard libraries and typical machine learning procedures. No signs of obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for eigenvalue-based kernel regression and classification, with extensive parameter validation and data handling. Uses sklearn utilities for validation and random state control. Kernel computation is flexible, supporting multiple kernel types. Training involves eigen-decomposition and iterative updates of model coefficients. Predictions are made via kernel evaluations. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or hidden data exfiltration observed. Implementation appears standard for a kernel method library. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of EigenPro-based kernel methods for regression and classification, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs standard machine learning techniques and libraries without obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
