  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a data processing or utility function, but without further context, its specific purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or file operations (if present). Since no explicit input methods are shown in the snippet, sources are not clearly identifiable.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, file writes, or database operations. No explicit sinks are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves reading input (sources), processing or transforming data, and then output or storing data at sinks, if any. No clear source-to-sink flow is evident without further code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. No anomalies are apparent in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal or not provided explicitly, making detailed analysis challenging. Based on available information, the code does not exhibit behaviors typical of malware or malicious sabotage. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or security flaws in the visible portions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. Due to limited information, confidence is moderate, and no obfuscation or malware behaviors are detected.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
