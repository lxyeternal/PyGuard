{
  "purpose": "Defines the public interface for a module related to EigenPro algorithms by importing specific classes from a submodule.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local submodule ('._eigenpro')",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import from local module to current namespace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple import and export of classes",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes from a local submodule and exposes them via __all__, which is standard practice for defining module exports. There are no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data leaks, network communication, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, with minimal logic, focused solely on module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module import/export pattern with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
