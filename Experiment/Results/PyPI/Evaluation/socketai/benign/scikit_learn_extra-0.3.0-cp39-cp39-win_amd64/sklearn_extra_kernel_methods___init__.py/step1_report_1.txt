{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module and defines public API exports.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from a relative module '._eigenpro'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines import and export behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply imports classes and declares __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative import syntax which is common in packages; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module __init__.py pattern, importing specific classes from a local submodule and setting __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external data flows. It appears to be a normal package setup for exposing classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for package structure initialization, and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
