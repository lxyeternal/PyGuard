{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports classes from a local module '_eigenpro' for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._eigenpro and the __all__ list define sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import source to the exported __all__ list, which specifies accessible classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and standard for Python module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a relative module '_eigenpro' and exposes them via __all__ for public API. It does not perform any data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and syntax are typical for Python package modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module export with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
