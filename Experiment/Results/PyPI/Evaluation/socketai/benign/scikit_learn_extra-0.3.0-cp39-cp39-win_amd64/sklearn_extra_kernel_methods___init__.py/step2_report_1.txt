  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import and export pattern, typical for Python package initialization (`__init__.py`).\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, dynamic execution, or data handling.\n   - The code only imports classes from a local module and declares `__all__`.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The analysis is thorough and aligns with standard Python package practices.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, malware, or security risk, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or risks based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard module initialization pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
