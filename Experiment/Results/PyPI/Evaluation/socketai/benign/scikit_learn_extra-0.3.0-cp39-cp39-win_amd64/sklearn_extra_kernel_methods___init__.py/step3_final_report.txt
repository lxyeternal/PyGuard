  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific classes from a local submodule '_eigenpro' and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._eigenpro module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from local module to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py pattern, importing classes and defining __all__. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with full confidence. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions or handle untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no improvements are necessary.",
