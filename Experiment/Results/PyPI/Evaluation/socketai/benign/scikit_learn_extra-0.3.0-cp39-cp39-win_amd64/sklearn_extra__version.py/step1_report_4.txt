  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a version string assignment, no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single assignment statement setting __version__ to '0.3.0'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. The version string appears normal and does not indicate malicious intent. This is a standard practice for Python packages to specify versioning information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves only to declare the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
