  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; only a static variable assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic assignment of a version string to __version__, with no functions, data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. There are no hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities, and the code aligns with standard practices for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
