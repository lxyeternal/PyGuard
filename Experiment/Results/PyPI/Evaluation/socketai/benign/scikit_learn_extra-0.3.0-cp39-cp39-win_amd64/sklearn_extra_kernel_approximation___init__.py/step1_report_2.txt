{
  "purpose": "The code exports the Fastfood class from the _fastfood module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the _fastfood module to access the Fastfood class.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The module import flow is straightforward; it does not involve untrusted data or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and declares an export list. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or include any suspicious logic. The presence of a module with an underscore prefix (_fastfood) suggests internal or private module, but that alone is not malicious. No malware indicators or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module export statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a straightforward, standard Python pattern for re-exporting classes.",
