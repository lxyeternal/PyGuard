{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Fastfood' class from a local internal module '_fastfood' and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._fastfood import Fastfood",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or system interactions",
  "flows": "Import of 'Fastfood' from '_fastfood' and exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import of a class from an internal module and exposing it. There are no runtime operations, data processing, external communications, or obfuscation. The use of an underscore-prefixed module indicates internal implementation, which is common and not suspicious. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module pattern for exposing a class from an internal module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
