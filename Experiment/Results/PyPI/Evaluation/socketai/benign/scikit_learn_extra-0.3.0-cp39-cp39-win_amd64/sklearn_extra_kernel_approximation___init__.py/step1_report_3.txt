  "purpose": "This code imports a class or function named 'Fastfood' from a relative module '_fastfood' and exposes it for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '_fastfood'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code merely imports and exports a symbol.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated elements, and no suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and minimal, importing a symbol from a local module and making it publicly available. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or security concerns. The use of a relative import indicates it's part of a package's internal structure. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module import and export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The code appears benign and typical for a Python package.",
