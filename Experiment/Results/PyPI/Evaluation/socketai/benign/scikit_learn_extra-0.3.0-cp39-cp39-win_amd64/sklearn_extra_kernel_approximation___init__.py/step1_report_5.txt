{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Fastfood' class or function from a local module named '_fastfood' and exposes it as part of the module's public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '_fastfood' to import 'Fastfood'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: importing 'Fastfood' from '_fastfood' and exposing it; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable point is the underscore-prefixed module '_fastfood', which suggests it is intended to be private, but its import does not seem suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and purely structural, importing a class or function from a local module and exposing it. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of a private module '_fastfood' is a common pattern to hide implementation details. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present. The code does not perform any operations beyond importing and exposing an entity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for Python modules organizing their API. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
