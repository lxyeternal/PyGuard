{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class named 'Fastfood' from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: 'from ._fastfood import Fastfood'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data leakage or system modification.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply exposes a class from a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, performing a local import and defining the public API. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity is present. It lacks any runtime logic, network activity, or data processing that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be a standard module setup for exposing a class. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
