{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple module import and export statement, designed to include the '_fastfood' module's 'Fastfood' class or object for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's '_fastfood' submodule to import 'Fastfood'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processing occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'Fastfood' from a local module and exposing it via '__all__', which is standard practice and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is minimal and follows typical import/export patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Fastfood' from a local module '_fastfood' and then exposes it for external use via '__all__'. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages that re-export internal components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module export statement without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It adheres to standard Python module practices and does not pose any security threats.",
