{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or library function, but without additional context or comments, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to logs, network connections, or system commands; potentially writes to files or executes code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment/config) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks (outputs, network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, but lack of comments, use of dynamic evaluation, or suspicious imports could indicate hidden intent. Further details are needed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or missing in this snippet, making detailed analysis difficult. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are apparent. Without concrete code, no malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors can be identified. The structure seems straightforward, but incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but lacks context to definitively confirm its safety.",
