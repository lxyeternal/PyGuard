  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, obfuscation patterns, dynamic execution points, external data reads, network connections, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, eval/exec calls, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or data inputs leading to sinks like network transmission or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, incomplete or minimal code.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates obfuscation (0.8), dynamic execution, and suspicious patterns, justifying higher malware (0.6) and risk (0.7) scores. Reports 2-5 show no signs of malicious activity, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk (0.2). The scores are consistent with the described code behaviors and suspicion levels. No adjustments are necessary as the scores align with the evidence and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's higher scores are justified due to obfuscation and suspicion of malicious intent. The other reports are benign, with appropriate low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent and accurate based on the provided descriptions.",
