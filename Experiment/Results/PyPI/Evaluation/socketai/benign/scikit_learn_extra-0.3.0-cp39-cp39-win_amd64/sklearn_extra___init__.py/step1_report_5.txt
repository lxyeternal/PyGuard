{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, importing internal modules and defining the package version for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'kernel_approximation', 'kernel_methods', and '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or outputted to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code only performs imports and defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and sets the __all__ attribute to expose only the '__version__' attribute. These actions are typical in package setup files. There is no data processing, no external network communication, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The code is minimal, standard, and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization fragment, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
