{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing local modules and exposing the version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: kernel_approximation, kernel_methods, and _version.py",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity present",
  "flows": "Import statements are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and version exposure with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file for a Python package, importing local modules and setting __all__ to expose __version__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks. The use of # noqa is typical for lint suppression. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
