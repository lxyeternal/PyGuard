{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, mainly for importing modules and exposing the __version__ attribute.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (kernel_approximation, kernel_methods, and _version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data exposure.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only performs module imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the import statements are standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file. It imports local modules and exposes the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or code obfuscation. The import statements are from local modules, which is typical for package setup. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
