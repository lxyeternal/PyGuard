{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, used to define package exports and import submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing submodules 'kernel_approximation' and 'kernel_methods', and version info from '_version'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only internal imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package initialization code with standard import and export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to kernel approximation and methods, and sets the __all__ attribute for package exports. It also imports version information. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply manages module imports and exports, with no suspicious or harmful patterns.",
