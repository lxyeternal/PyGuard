{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, importing modules and defining package exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: kernel_approximation, kernel_methods, and __version__",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no external data or untrusted inputs are handled",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not involve untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely manages module imports and exports within a package. The import statements are standard for organizing package contents. There is no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data leakage observed. The presence of a version import indicates proper package versioning. No malicious or malicious-looking patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves the purpose of exposing specific modules and version info without any suspicious activity.",
