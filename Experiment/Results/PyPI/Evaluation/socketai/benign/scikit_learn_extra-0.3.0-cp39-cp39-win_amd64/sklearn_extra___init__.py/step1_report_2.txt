{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, defining exports and importing submodules for kernel approximation and methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules 'kernel_approximation', 'kernel_methods', and version information from '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external data handling; no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules and version module, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. Use of 'noqa' is common for linting, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports local modules and sets the __all__ variable to expose '__version__'. There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, or potential attack vectors. The presence of '__version__' import indicates version tracking, and the use of 'noqa' suggests linting suppression. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for a Python package's initialization module, managing imports and exports without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
