{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 service in Python, used for data validation and type hinting in SDKs or applications.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: __future__, sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; class definitions and constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; primarily static type definitions and data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code does not process or execute external inputs or commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of type hints and structured data is standard. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or system commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of TypedDict class definitions, constants, and conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime logic, external data processing, or command execution is present. The use of imports and type annotations is conventional for type safety in SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK in Python, with no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use in SDK or application development.",
