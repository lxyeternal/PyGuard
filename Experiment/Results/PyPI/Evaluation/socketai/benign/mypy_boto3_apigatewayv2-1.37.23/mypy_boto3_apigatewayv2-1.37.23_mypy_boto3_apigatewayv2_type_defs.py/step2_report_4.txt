  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It’s a standard SDK stub for static type checking.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime or executable logic. The confidence level is high (0.95), and no malware or security risks are present.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a static, purely structural module with no malicious intent. The confidence is even higher (1.0).  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for type annotations.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is static type definitions with no active data flow or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is that some fields like 'Body', 'Tags', 'Arn', or 'Uri' could be manipulated if misused, but the code itself does not process or execute data.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that these are data structures meant for validation and type checking, not execution. The mention of the future year (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.  \n- **Justification for malware score:** Zero, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Verdict:** No security issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a static set of type definitions with no runtime logic, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns. It is a legitimate SDK helper module.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct; no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is purely static, with no execution, network calls, or data manipulation. It is a set of type annotations and definitions for AWS API Gateway V2.  \n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the nature of the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—strictly static type definitions with no runtime or external data processing—the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n**Justification:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2. It contains no dynamic code, no network operations, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscation. The only potential concern could be if someone injects malicious data into fields like 'Body', 'Tags', or 'Arn', but this is outside the scope of static type definitions. The code itself is safe, legitimate, and standard for SDK or stub files.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or very close to zero, as the code is purely declarative and safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. It is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, serving as a static aid for type checking and validation.",
