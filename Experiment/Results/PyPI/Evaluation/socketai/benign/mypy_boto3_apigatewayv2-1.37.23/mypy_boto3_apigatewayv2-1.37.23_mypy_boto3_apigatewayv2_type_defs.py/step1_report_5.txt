{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structure specifications for AWS API Gateway V2 service in Python, mainly used for typing and validation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, standard library modules (sys, datetime, typing), and the use of type annotations within class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no execution of untrusted data, no network calls, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to static type annotations and structured data definitions; no runtime data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is predominantly type definitions and imports, with no executable or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version. No code executes dynamic or malicious actions. The import statements and type definitions are static and for typing purposes only. There are no functions performing runtime operations, no network requests, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The use of sys.version_info to conditionally import typing extensions is standard practice and not suspicious. Overall, the structure is consistent with a type definition module meant for static analysis, not runtime execution or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a purely declarative, static module intended for type safety and validation, containing no runtime or executable code that could pose security threats.",
