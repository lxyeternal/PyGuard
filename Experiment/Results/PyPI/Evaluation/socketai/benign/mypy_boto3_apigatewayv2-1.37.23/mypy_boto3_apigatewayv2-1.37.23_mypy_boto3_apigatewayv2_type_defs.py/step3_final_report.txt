{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK in Python, serving as static type checking aids without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "The code sources from standard modules (__future__, sys, datetime, typing), literals, and annotations; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or runtime data flows; the code is purely declarative with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths exist; the code defines static types and data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright, which is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable code, network operations, or dynamic data handling. The structure is straightforward, serving as a schema for type safety in SDK usage. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is consistent with standard SDK stub files, and the presence of the year 2025 is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, static SDK type definition module for AWS API Gateway V2 in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe and purely structural.",
