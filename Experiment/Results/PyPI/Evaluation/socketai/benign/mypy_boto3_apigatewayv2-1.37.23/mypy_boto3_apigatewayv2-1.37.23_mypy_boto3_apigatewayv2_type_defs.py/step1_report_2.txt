{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 service using TypedDict for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; only type definitions and imports from standard libraries, third-party typing extensions, and project modules.",
  "sinks": "No execution sinks or untrusted data handling points; no code execution, network calls, or data manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation; the code solely defines data structures for type safety.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily comprises structured type definitions, with no dynamic code or external code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules for type hinting, defines numerous TypedDict classes representing AWS API Gateway structures, and sets up type unions for flexibility. No functions, network operations, or data processing logic are present. The file is purely structural, serving as a type hinting aid. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a well-structured type definition module for SDK or code generation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-executable, purely structural module defining types for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code serves as a type-safe schema for API interactions and is safe for use.",
