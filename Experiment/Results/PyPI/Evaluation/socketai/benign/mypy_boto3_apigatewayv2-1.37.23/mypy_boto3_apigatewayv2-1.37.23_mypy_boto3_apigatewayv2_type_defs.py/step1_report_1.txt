  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for AWS API Gateway V2 service for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Constants, imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, .literals), class and variable definitions, type annotations, and code comments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines data structures and types without processing or executing data. No network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines data types and structures. No data flow from source to sink is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard type definitions and comments; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules (including sys, datetime, typing, botocore). It defines various TypedDict classes representing API Gateway configurations, responses, and request structures with optional and required fields. Conditional imports based on Python version are present, which is normal for compatibility. No functions, network operations, or runtime behavior are included. The purpose is to provide type annotations for API interactions, which is common in SDK or stub files. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, intended for static type checking and validation. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK stub with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
