  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code is for type definitions and validation, sourcing from standard modules, literals, and annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or execution; purely structural.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; the future year (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirmed as standard type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (high confidence, no issues)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, emphasizing static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or dynamic data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the code is purely structural.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, static type annotations with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 (absolute confidence)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data execution or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard for SDK stub files.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with emphasis on type safety.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, purely static type definitions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, defining types for static analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or runtime code.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify the code as purely static type definitions with no malicious behavior. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and readable. Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime code, external data handling, or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is negligible. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK in Python.\n- No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or malicious logic are detected.\n- The code serves as a static, declarative schema for type safety, typical in SDK stub files.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
