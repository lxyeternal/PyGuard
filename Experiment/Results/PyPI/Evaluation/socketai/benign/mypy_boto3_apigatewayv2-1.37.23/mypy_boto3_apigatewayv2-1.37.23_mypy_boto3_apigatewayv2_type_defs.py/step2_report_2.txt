  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, with no runtime logic, network operations, or data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns. The code is declarative, intended for static type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate SDK stub.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as non-malicious, purely structural, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; the code is type annotations and data structures with no active data flow or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code is static, defining data structures for AWS API Gateway V2, with no execution logic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; purely static type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no runtime logic, no malicious code, purely type annotations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The code contains only type annotations and data structures, no executable or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code is static, intended for type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (type definitions only), the risk score should be very low, ideally near 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, intended for static analysis, type checking, and validation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or external code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Clear, straightforward type definitions)\n- **Risk:** **0** (Purely static, no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the actual code content. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK stub for type safety, with no security concerns.",
