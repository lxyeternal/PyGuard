  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security risks, malware, obfuscation, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, with no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static set of type annotations and data structures. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion and confidence (0.95) are justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a static, non-executable set of type definitions. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature—purely structural, for static type checking.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Appropriate.**  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a comprehensive static type annotation module for AWS API Gateway V2, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Correct.**  \n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is sound, and the confidence level (1.0) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static set of type definitions, with no runtime or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed review confirms that the code is purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Appropriate.**  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type definitions with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the static nature and safety of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2, intended for type checking and validation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero; the code is purely declarative and does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** Very high (mostly 1.0), consistent with the nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0**.\n\n**The current assessments in all reports are accurate and justified.** There is no indication of sabotage, malicious behavior, or security issues in this code. It is a standard, well-structured type definition module for AWS SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is safe, legitimate, and purely structural. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**",
