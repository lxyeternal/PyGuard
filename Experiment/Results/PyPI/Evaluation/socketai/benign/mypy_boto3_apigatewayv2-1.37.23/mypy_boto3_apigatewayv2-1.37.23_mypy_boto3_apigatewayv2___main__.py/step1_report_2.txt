{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for displaying package information and version details for a Python library related to boto3 API Gateway v2 stubs.",
  "sources": "Input source is sys.argv for command-line arguments; outputs are written to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() outputs data to the terminal; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (potentially untrusted) flows to decision branches; outputs are directed to stdout based on the arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated language, or hardcoded secrets; code is straightforward and standard for a CLI script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output operations. It defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks if '--version' is present in command-line arguments to decide which info to display. The script executes main() if run directly. No external data sources, no untrusted data processing beyond command-line argument checking. No external libraries or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and straightforward with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
