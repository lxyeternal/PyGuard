  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic data fetching, external network calls, or data processing occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The functions are simple, and the control flow is minimal.\n\n2. **Issues in the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the script only outputs static information based on user input.\n   - No discrepancies or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0, with some reports giving 0.1 possibly as a conservative default for minimal risk. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is justified.\n   \n   **Suggestion**: The minimal risk score should be 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Risk Justification**:\n   - Since the code only prints static info and responds to a command-line argument, the risk is negligible.\n   - No external data handling, no code execution beyond printing, and no network activity.\n   - Therefore, any risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:\n   - No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n   - The code is static and benign.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and assume benign intent, which is appropriate.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a simple, static informational CLI utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
