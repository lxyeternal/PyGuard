  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs data).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' flows from sys.argv to print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No suspicious or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. All outputs are informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() if run directly. It processes a command-line argument '--version' to selectively print version info, otherwise prints static package details. There are no data leaks, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The only output is informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility designed for informational purposes only. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic output operations based on command-line input and does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data.",
