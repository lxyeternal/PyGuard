{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line input; static strings in print_info() and print_version() functions.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (source) triggers print_version() or print_info() (sink) based on input; static data flows directly to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard library, performs minimal logic, and outputs fixed strings. No external calls, secrets, or dynamic code. It correctly responds to '--version' argument and defaults to printing package info. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The logic is transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple output based on command-line input, with no suspicious or malicious code. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
