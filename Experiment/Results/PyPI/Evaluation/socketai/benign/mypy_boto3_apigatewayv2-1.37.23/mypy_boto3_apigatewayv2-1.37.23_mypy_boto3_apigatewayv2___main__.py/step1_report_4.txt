{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a Python package, providing information about the package version and details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, the version is printed; otherwise, package info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The script performs straightforward informational output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for input/output operations, defines functions to print static package info and version, and executes a main function that responds to a command-line argument '--version'. The logic is simple, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing. No indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a standard CLI tool for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this script.",
