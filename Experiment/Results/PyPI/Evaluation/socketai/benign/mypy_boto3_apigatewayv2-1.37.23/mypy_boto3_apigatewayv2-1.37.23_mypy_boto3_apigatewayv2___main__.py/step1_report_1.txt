  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code. No data leakage or unexpected behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks for a '--version' argument to decide what to print. The code is straightforward, with no external data fetching, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscation. The functionality is limited to printing static information based on user input. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign, well-structured script intended for informational purposes.",
