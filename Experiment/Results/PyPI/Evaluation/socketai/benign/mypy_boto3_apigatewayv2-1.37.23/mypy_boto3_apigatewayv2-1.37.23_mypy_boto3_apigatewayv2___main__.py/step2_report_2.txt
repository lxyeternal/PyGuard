  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI script that:\n  - Imports only the standard library (`sys`).\n  - Defines `print_info()` and `print_version()` functions that output static, hardcoded information about the package.\n  - Checks command-line arguments for `--version` to decide what to output.\n  - No external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no secrets.\n  - No network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n  - The code is simple, well-structured, and performs only informational output.\n\n**2. Report Summaries:**\n\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that:\n  - The script is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static information.\n  - No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n  - No external calls, no secrets, no data leakage.\n  - The logic is simple and transparent.\n  - Confidence is high (1.0), and all report scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are zero.\n\n**3. Issues with the Reports:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They appropriately assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- The security risk is minimal (0.1 or 0 in all reports), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected or claimed.\n\n**4. Score Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and static nature, a low risk score (close to 0) is justified. The highest observed is 0.1, which is acceptable.\n\n**5. Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is that the code outputs static data, which is not inherently risky, but if the environment or context were malicious, static output could be used for misinformation. However, based solely on this code, that concern is unwarranted.\n- The reports do not mention any potential for future malicious updates, but that is outside the scope of static code review.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable considering the minimal security risk noted)\n\n**7. Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0 for absolute certainty)\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the analysis provided.",
