  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for the boto3 ApiGatewayV2 client, enabling type-safe interaction with AWS API Gateway v2 services.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in method calls (kwargs), type definitions imported from other modules, and class property/method decorators.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that interact with AWS services, but these are standard SDK calls with no evidence of untrusted data handling or malicious injection points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls; no evidence of data being passed from untrusted sources within this code snippet. The code mainly defines interface and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code appears to be a well-structured SDK interface with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, property definitions, and overloads for creating paginators. It imports and uses standard AWS SDK classes and type definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are placeholders with only signatures and docstrings, reflecting standard SDK interface design. No suspicious logic, hidden code, or anomaly indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around the boto3 AWS SDK for API Gateway v2. The code is well-structured, uses appropriate type annotations, and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
