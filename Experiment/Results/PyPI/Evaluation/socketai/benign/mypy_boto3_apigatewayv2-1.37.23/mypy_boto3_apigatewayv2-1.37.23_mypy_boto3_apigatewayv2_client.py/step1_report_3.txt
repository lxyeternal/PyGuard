{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS API Gateway V2 service, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS APIs.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules, defines client class, property methods, and API operation methods with type annotations, mostly for documentation and SDK interaction.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks processing untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; code primarily defines method signatures and documentation references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is mostly type annotations and method stubs aligned with AWS SDK documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured SDK wrapper for AWS API Gateway V2, including class and method definitions with type annotations for enhanced static typing. It imports necessary modules, defines a client class with property methods, overloads for paginator methods, and detailed docstrings referencing official AWS documentation. There are no runtime behaviors, external data processing, or suspicious code features. The structure aligns with standard SDK design and documentation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is solely for providing type safety and documentation for AWS API interactions. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
