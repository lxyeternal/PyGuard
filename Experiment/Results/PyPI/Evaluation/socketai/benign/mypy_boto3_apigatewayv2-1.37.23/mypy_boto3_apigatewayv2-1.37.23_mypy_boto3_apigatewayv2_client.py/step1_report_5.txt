{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 apigatewayv2 service, facilitating type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures with type annotations; property and method implementations that return types or perform actions based on parameters.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow from input parameters to returned data types; no dynamic execution or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type annotations and overloads, which could be used to obfuscate or complicate understanding; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a class definition for an API client with method signatures, property accessors, and overloads for paginators, all referencing external documentation. No code executes dynamically, loads untrusted input, or performs network operations. The purpose is to provide type hints and a structured client interface. No anomalies or malicious patterns such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code appears to be an open-source SDK interface designed for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured client interface with type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely declarative, providing method signatures and type hints for SDK use.",
