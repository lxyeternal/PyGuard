  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK, facilitating static typing and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting kwargs, importing SDK types, and documentation references.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters passed into SDK calls; no untrusted data handling or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK methods; no malicious or suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; extensive overloads are typical for SDK stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, auto-generated SDK interface with detailed type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It does not contain executable logic, dynamic code, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The high scores for malware and obfuscation are justified as the code is purely a static type stub. The slightly elevated security risk score in some reports reflects the complexity but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS API Gateway V2, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threats. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate given its purpose. No further action is necessary.",
