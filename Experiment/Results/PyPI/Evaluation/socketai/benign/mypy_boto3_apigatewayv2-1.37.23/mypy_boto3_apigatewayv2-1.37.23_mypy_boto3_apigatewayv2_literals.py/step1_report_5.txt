  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2 service literals and related constants to facilitate type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Static data: string literals for various AWS service names, resource names, paginator names, regions, and specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None. The code only declares constants and type aliases without any data input/output operations or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code consists solely of static type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and constant declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal type aliases for AWS services, resource types, paginator names, regions, and other enums, along with a service name literal. There are no data inputs, external communications, or executable logic beyond type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to serve as a type-annotated constants module for AWS SDK type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS-related constants, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a static type hints module, with no active data handling or suspicious behavior.",
