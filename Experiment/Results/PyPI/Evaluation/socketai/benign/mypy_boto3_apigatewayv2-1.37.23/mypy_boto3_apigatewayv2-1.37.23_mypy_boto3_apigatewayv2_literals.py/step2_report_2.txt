  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the scores assigned, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS API Gateway v2 constants, resource names, regions, paginator names, etc.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code, no input/output, no network activity, no secrets or credentials.\n- The purpose is for static type checking, documentation, and code clarity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- Purpose: Define type annotations for constants used in `boto3_apigatewayv2`.\n- Findings: No sinks, flows, anomalies, or security issues.\n- Score: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Purpose: Define type literals for API Gateway V2 constants.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Purpose: Define type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2 literals.\n- Findings: No dynamic code, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe and static.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2 constants.\n- Findings: Static data, no input/output, no anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Purpose: Type definitions for AWS API Gateway V2 constants.\n- Findings: Static, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and purely for type annotations.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware = 0, securityRisk = 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are high, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**. No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** as well, since the code is purely static and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code.** The code is a benign static type definitions module for AWS SDK constants, with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
