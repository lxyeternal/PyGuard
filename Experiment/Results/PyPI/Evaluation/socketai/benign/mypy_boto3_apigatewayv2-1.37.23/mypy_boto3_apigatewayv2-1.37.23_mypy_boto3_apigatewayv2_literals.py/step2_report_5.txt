  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS SDK constants, primarily for type checking and documentation.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network communication, or input/output handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, secrets, or backdoors.\n- The purpose appears to be purely for static type annotations and documentation support.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Correct; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the constants and type alias definitions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Accurate; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the definitions and conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Accurate; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; details the type annotations and constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Accurate; no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the static data and type aliases.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Accurate; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, defining string literal types for AWS SDK constants.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected; no secrets, no dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1 for all reports, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely static, intended for type annotations, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough, accurate, and aligned with the code content.
