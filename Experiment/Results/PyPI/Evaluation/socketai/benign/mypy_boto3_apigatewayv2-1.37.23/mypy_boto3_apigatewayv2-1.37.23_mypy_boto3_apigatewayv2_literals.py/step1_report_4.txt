{
  "purpose": "To define type annotations for AWS API Gateway v2 literals and related string constants for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; all definitions are static string literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions or data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is purely defining constants and type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It defines numerous string literal types representing AWS service names, resource names, pagination functions, and configuration options. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network operations are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. All elements are static and intended for type hinting and documentation, aligned with typical SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and constants for AWS SDKs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
