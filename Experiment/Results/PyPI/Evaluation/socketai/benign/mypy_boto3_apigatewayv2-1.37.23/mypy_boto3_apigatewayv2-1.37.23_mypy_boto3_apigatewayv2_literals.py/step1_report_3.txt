  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS API Gateway V2 service components, constants, and configurations to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Module imports (sys, typing), variable assignments (literal definitions).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no untrusted input handling or data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; primarily static definitions and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various Literal types for AWS API Gateway V2 related constants. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, which is standard practice. The large list of string literals is static data for type annotations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling is present. The code appears to serve as a type definition module, with no malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, establishing type literals for API constants. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It serves as a static type definitions module for type checking purposes.",
