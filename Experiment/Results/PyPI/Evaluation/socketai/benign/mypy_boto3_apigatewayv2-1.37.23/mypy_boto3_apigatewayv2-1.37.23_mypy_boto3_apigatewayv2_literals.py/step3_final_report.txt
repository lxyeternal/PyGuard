  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2 literal definitions and constants to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, and string literal assignments defining constants.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module defining string literal types for AWS SDK constants, used for static type checking. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output handling, network activity, secrets, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, static code intended solely for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definitions module for AWS SDK constants with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its static, safe nature. No modifications are necessary.",
