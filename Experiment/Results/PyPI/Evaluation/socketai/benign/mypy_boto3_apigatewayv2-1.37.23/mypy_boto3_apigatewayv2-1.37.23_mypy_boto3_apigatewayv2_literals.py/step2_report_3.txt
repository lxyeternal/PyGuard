  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Static type definitions for AWS SDK constants.  \n- Sources: Code reads import statements, Python version check, and string literal assignments.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No data processing, only static definitions.  \n- Anomalies: None detected; code is benign.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: The code is purely static, intended for type safety, with no malicious behavior.  \n- Malware Score: 0 — aligns with the benign nature.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n- Risk Score: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Define type literals for API Gateway V2 constants.  \n- Sources: Constants, conditional import of 'Literal'.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No data handling.  \n- Anomalies: None detected; code is declarative.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Safe, static, for type annotations.  \n- Malware Score: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to above, for AWS API Gateway V2 constants.  \n- Sources: Imports, string literals.  \n- Sinks & Flows: None.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Static definitions, no malicious behavior.  \n- Malware Score: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS API Gateway V2 literals.  \n- Sources: Imports, static string literals.  \n- Sinks & Flows: None.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Safe, static, for type safety.  \n- Malware Score: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Define constants for AWS SDK type checking.  \n- Sources: String literals, conditional import.  \n- Sinks & Flows: None.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Static, safe, purely for type annotations.  \n- Malware Score: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static, declarative type alias definitions for AWS SDK constants, with no dynamic code, input handling, or network operations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** None; these are purely static type definitions meant for static analysis and documentation.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard static type annotations module, common in SDKs for type safety.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard practice.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward static definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign, static nature.
