{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various constants used in the boto3_apigatewayv2 library, primarily for static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements, Python version check for typing.Literal import, and the assignment of string literals to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only defines type constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type aliases for static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The license and copyright info are benign. The code is a straightforward static type definitions module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations depending on Python version, defines various string literal types for AWS service constants, and includes comprehensive lists of string literals for resource, paginator, region, and service names. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures. The purpose appears to be providing static type definitions for AWS SDK integrations. No potential security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static definition module for AWS-related string constants with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
