  "purpose": "Define type literals for API Gateway V2 service, enumerations, and other related constants for type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constants and type alias definitions, import statements, conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing, input handling, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code solely defines constants and type aliases without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal for various enumerations related to the AWS API Gateway V2 service. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. The extensive list of constants and string literals appears to be automatically generated or maintained for type safety and documentation purposes. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network communication occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining constants and type aliases for use in type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for type safety and documentation purposes.",
