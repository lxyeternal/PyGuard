  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines static type annotations for AWS API Gateway v2 constants.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately notes that the code is purely static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and aligns with the code's purpose. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type literals for AWS API Gateway v2, with conditional import handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly recognizes the static nature, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is precise and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; focuses on static definitions and conditional import.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, safe, and non-malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the static data and conditional import.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that there's no dynamic code, no input/output, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same observations about static constants and conditional import.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is a straightforward static type definition module.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero in all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign zero scores to malware, obfuscation, and risk, which is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is purely declarative, providing static type annotations for AWS SDK constants. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data handling, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads. The conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough, accurate, and appropriately score the code as benign. No security concerns are present.",
