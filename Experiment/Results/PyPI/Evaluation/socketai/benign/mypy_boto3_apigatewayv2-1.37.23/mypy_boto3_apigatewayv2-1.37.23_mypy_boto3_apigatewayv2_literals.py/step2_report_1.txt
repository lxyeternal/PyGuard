  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS SDK (specifically API Gateway V2) constants.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- The code uses standard practices (conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines type aliases with `Literal` for various constants.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports agree on benign intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Data flow:** Static definitions only, no data processing or external inputs.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident; the code is straightforward and declarative.\n- The only minor note is that the extensive list of literals appears to be auto-generated or maintained, but that is standard for such definitions.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The `confidence` score of 1 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since all reports agree on no malicious intent, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The malware score is correctly **0**.\n- No reason to adjust scores upward.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a benign, static type definitions module for AWS SDK constants, with no security or malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for static type checking. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure such static definition modules are maintained and kept up-to-date with the latest constants, but that does not impact security analysis here.",
