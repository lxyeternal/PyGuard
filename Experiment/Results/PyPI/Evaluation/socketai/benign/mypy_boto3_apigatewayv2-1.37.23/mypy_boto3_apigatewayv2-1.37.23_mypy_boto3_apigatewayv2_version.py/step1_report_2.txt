  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ with a hardcoded string",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string is assigned, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single assignment statement setting __version__ to a static string '1.37.23'. The comment indicates it is a source of truth for the version, and the copyright notice is standard. No input, no external data sources, no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security risks identified. It appears to be a normal, benign practice for version control in Python packages.",
