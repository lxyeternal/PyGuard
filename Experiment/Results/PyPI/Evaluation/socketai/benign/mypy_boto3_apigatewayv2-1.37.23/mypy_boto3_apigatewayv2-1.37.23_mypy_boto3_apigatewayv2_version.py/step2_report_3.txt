  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input handling, external data, or dynamic code.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns.\n- All mention the presence of a copyright notice, which is standard.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is minimal and correct. It does exactly what it's intended to do: declare a version string.\n   - No issues or errors are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - The mention of the future copyright year (2025) as an anomaly is reasonable but does not imply security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and malware justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no dynamic or external components, the risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n   - The only minor anomaly (future copyright year) does not elevate risk.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - The analysis is consistent and cautious.\n\n**Summary and my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe only noteworthy point is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't impact security and is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
