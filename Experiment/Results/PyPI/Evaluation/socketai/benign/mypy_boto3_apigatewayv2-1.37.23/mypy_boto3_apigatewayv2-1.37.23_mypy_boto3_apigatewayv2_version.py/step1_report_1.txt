  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration with a copyright notice.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment and a single line assigning a version string to __version__. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The code appears to be a standard version identifier, which is common in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The presence of a copyright notice is typical and not suspicious. The code is minimal and clean.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a metadata marker for the package. No malware or security concerns are present.",
