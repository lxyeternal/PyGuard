  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in 2025, which is a future date and unusual for copyright declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a version string and a copyright notice. The version number appears normal. The copyright year 2025 is unusual, but it does not indicate malicious intent; it could be a placeholder or a typo. No data flows, inputs, or suspicious code patterns are present. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration with an atypical future copyright year. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, the code is benign.",
