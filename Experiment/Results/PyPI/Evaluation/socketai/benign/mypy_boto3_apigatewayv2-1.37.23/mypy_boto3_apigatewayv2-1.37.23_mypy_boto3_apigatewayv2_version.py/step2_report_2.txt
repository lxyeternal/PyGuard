  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - All reports confirm that there are no inputs, external data, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future and potentially inconsistent but not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are 0 or very close to 1, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.9, which is reasonable.\n   - The only potential concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not constitute a security risk or malicious activity. It might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n   - The code contains no suspicious or malicious code snippets.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n   - The future copyright year is noted but not overinterpreted.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, straightforward, and standard.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0.1** to reflect minimal concern about the future copyright year, but overall, it's negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and contains no security concerns.",
