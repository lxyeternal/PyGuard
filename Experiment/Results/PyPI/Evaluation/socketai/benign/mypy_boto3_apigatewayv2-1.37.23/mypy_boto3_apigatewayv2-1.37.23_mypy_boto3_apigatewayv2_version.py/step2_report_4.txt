  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python packages.\n- No input handling, external data, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-Report Review\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No issues; straightforward version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies; standard code.\n- **Scores:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Notes the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it’s not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence at 1.0 is appropriate; malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just an inconsistency in the copyright date.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above; notes the future date as an anomaly.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the unusual date, but no malware or security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the code.\n- Obfuscated = 0; no signs of obfuscation.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign, the risk score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, **my estimated scores** are:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe only point of concern is the future copyright year, which could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes needed to scores.\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Note:** If future updates include dynamic version handling or external inputs, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
