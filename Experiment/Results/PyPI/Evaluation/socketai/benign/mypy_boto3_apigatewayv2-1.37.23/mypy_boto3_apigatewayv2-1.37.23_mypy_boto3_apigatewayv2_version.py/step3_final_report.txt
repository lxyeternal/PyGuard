  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a string for version control and referencing.",
  "sources": "No external data, input, or dynamic code; only a static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignment without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input handling, external data, or dynamic behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, likely a typo or placeholder, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code and assign appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly (future copyright year) is benign and does not affect security. All assessments and scores are consistent with this analysis.",
