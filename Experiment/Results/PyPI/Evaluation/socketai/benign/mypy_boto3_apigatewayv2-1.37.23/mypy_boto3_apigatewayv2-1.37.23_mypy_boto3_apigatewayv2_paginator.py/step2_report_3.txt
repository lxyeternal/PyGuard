  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 'apigatewayv2'.\n- Sources & sinks: No untrusted data processing; only method parameters and return types.\n- Flows: Methods accept kwargs, return PageIterator.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Standard, benign code; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Risk assessment: **Malware = 0**, **Obfuscated = 0**, **Security risk = 0**.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose, focusing on type annotations for boto3 API Gateway V2.\n- No external data or malicious activity.\n- Standard practices used.\n- Risk assessment: **Malware = 0**, **Obfuscated = 0**, **Security risk = 0**.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar description, emphasizing type-safe pagination.\n- No external or untrusted data sources.\n- No malicious behavior observed.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) perhaps due to cautious wording, but no actual issues.\n- Risk assessment: **Malware = 0**, **Obfuscated = 0**, **Security risk = 0.1** (very minimal, possibly due to generic caution).\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focus on type annotations and paginator classes.\n- Uses **kwargs in paginate, typical for boto3.\n- No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n- Slightly more cautious: **securityRisk = 0.1**, but no actual evidence.\n- Risk assessment: **Malware = 0**, **Obfuscated = 0**, **Security risk = 0.1**.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar benign description.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Risk assessment: all zeros.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports describe standard, benign code for boto3 paginator type annotations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Slightly elevated security risk scores in some reports (0.1) seem to be conservative, possibly due to the use of **kwargs in methods, which is common in boto3 and not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (type annotations, class definitions, no external data handling), the overall risk remains negligible. The small 0.1 scores are overly cautious and not justified by actual malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured type stub for boto3's apigatewayv2 paginators, with no security concerns.",
