{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 apigatewayv2 service client, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods defining paginate with unpacked request types.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) which are unpacked into specific request types; no external or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "flows": "User code calls paginate, passing in arguments; these are unpacked and used within boto3 paginator internals; no external data or untrusted input sources are directly processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The code predominantly consists of type annotations, class definitions, and straightforward method overrides. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes with associated type annotations for a boto3 service client. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and employs standard class inheritance and method overriding patterns. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the accepting of **kwargs in paginate methods, which is typical for boto3 paginators, and does not suggest malicious activity. No code injection, obfuscation, or harmful logic is present. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 pagination, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation setup for boto3 paginator classes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves a purely functional purpose in type hinting and class structure for API response pagination.",
