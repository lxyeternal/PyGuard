  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's apigatewayv2 service, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "The get_paginator method calls with string operation names; no external data or user input processed.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept kwargs unpacked into request types; no untrusted data flows or leaks.",
  "flows": "Source: method call with kwargs; Sink: passing kwargs to boto3 paginator; flow remains within SDK, no external data exposure.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard class inheritance, conditional imports, and typing patterns without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for paginator classes, with methods accepting kwargs and returning PageIterator objects. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of kwargs is typical for boto3 SDK methods and does not indicate malicious intent. The conditional import of Unpack is standard for Python versions >= 3.12. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a type stub for SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minimal risk score of 0.1 in some reports is overly cautious; in this context, the code is safe and standard.",
