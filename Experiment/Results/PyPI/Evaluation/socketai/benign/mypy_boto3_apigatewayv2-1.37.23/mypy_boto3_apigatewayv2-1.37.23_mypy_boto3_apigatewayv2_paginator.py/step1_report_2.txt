  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS API Gateway V2 service client, facilitating type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Data reading occurs via method parameters in 'paginate' functions, with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external data leaks; no network or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "Paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments for request parameters, returning PageIterator objects; no data flows indicate untrusted input affecting critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with clear type annotations and no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for paginators of the boto3 AWS SDK for the API Gateway V2 service, using standard practices for type hinting, conditional imports based on Python version, and segregating code for type checking. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected; the functions are simple wrappers for paginator methods, and the overall structure is consistent with typical SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to provide type safety and clarity for SDK usage.",
