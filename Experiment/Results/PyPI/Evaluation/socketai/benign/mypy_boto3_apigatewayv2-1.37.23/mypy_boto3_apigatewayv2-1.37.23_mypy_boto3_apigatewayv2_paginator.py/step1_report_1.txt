{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'apigatewayv2' service client, facilitating static type checking and IDE support for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no user input or external data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code defines methods that accept arbitrary keyword arguments for pagination but does not process untrusted data directly; no sinks for data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' methods accept parameters as per defined type defs and return PageIterator objects; there are no external data flows or untrusted source-to-sink paths within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard typing constructs and typical class inheritance patterns. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious imports are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of type annotations for boto3 paginators, including class definitions with 'paginate' methods that wrap boto3's existing paginator functionality. The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility and the separation of type-only imports suggest standard, well-structured code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations involve static typing and class inheritance without any dynamic code execution or external data handling beyond boto3 client interactions, which are safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation and paginator class wrapper for boto3's 'apigatewayv2' client. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk score is negligible.",
