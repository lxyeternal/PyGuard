  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the apigatewayv2 service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls with proper type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs. Uses sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations in paginate functions, which accept untrusted kwargs for pagination parameters; no other data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked from specific type defs, then return PageIterator objects. No external data flows or network interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is primarily class and method definitions for type annotations, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for various API methods, adding type annotations and documentation links. It employs conditional imports for Python version compatibility. The paginate methods accept dynamic kwargs with specific types, returning page iterators. There are no signs of data leakage, external network activity, or malicious logic. The structure aligns with standard type stub patterns for boto3 clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate type annotation stub for boto3's apigatewayv2 paginators. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a well-structured, standard implementation for type hints and paginator class definitions.",
