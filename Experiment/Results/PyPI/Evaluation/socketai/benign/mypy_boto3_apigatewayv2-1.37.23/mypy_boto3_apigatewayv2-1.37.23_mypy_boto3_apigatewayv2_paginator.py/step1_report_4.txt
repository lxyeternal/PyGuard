{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 apigatewayv2 service client, providing type-safe pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no external or untrusted data sources used.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to client.get_paginator() and the paginate() method, which accept untrusted keyword arguments; no data leaks or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "The code defines paginator classes that call the client's get_paginator method with specific string arguments and then use the paginate method with user-provided keyword arguments unpacked into the request types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All code follows standard patterns for boto3 stubs and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliasing, conditional imports based on Python version, and class definitions for paginators with paginate methods that accept untrusted kwargs. The classes extend generic Paginator with specific response types. No suspicious or malicious operations are present. All imports and class structures adhere to typical boto3-stubs patterns, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate type-stub implementation for boto3 paginator classes, providing type safety and documentation links. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
