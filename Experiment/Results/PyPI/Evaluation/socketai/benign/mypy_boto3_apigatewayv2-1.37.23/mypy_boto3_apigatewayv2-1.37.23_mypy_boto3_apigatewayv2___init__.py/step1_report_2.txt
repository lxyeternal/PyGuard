{
  "purpose": "Provides interface and imports for interacting with AWS API Gateway V2 service via boto3, including paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client, .paginator), and inline documentation.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No handling of untrusted data, external network communication, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and serves as a module interface.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, documentation, and defining an alias for a client class. No runtime data input handling or external data processing observed. The documentation includes example usage, but this is static and not executable code within the module. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. All elements appear standard for a client interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface module for AWS API Gateway V2 using boto3. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or hidden functionality.",
