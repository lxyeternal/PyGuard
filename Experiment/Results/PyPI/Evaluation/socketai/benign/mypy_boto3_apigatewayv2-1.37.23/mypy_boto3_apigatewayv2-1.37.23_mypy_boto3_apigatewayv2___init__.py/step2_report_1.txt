  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes, defines an alias, and exports symbols for interacting with AWS API Gateway V2 via boto3.\n- No dynamic data handling, external input processing, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is static, mainly serving as an SDK interface or wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with typical SDK wrapper modules.\n- **Security concerns:** None are evident from static analysis.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activities.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Data flow:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent: no malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Potential concern about the 'client' creation:** The only dynamic element is `session.client(\"apigatewayv2\")`. If the `Session` object is controlled externally, it could lead to misconfigured clients, but this is standard usage and not inherently malicious.\n- **No external input or untrusted data:** The code does not process external data, so injection or data exfiltration risks are absent.\n- **No obfuscation or hidden behavior:** The code is transparent and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Final score recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (standard SDK wrapper, no security issues)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, standard module for AWS API Gateway V2 interaction, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0**      |\n\nThis aligns with the static analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code introduces dynamic input handling, network communication, or obfuscation, scores should be revisited accordingly.",
