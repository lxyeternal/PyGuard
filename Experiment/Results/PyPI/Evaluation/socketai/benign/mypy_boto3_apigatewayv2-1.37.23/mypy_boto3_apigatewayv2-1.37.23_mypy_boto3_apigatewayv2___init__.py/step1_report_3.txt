{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the API Gateway V2 service in AWS, importing client and paginator classes for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules and defines constants and aliases; no input sources or untrusted data reading present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be sent or leaked; the code primarily imports modules and defines public API.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is for defining and exporting classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules, sets an alias for the client class, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The content appears to be a standard module setup for an SDK-like interface. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for AWS API Gateway V2 SDK interface, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and primarily serves as a wrapper for SDK components.",
