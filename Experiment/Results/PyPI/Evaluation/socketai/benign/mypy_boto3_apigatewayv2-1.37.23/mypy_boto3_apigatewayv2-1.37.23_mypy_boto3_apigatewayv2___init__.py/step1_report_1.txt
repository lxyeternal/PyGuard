{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and imports for interacting with the AWS API Gateway V2 service using boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), documentation comment, and the module's own definitions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is read from external sources or written to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level documentation, import statements, and straightforward variable assignments. It imports classes and functions for boto3-based API interaction and defines a Client alias. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or data processing occurs that could pose security risks. The comments include example usage, but no code executes untrusted data or performs risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for AWS API Gateway interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis.",
