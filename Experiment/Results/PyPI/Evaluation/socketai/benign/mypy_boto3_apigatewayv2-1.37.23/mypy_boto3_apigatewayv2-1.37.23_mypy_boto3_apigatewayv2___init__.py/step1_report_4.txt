  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for the AWS API Gateway V2 service, including imports and setup for using boto3 paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator) and comments with usage documentation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or actions; no network or file operations are performed here.",
  "flows": "N/A, this is mainly import and setup code without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines imports, documentation, and module exports for a boto3-based API Gateway V2 interface. It includes a descriptive docstring, license info, and usage examples. All operations are standard, using public SDKs and proper module structure. No code injections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign interface module for AWS API Gateway V2 using boto3. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply exports classes and paginators for use in other modules.",
