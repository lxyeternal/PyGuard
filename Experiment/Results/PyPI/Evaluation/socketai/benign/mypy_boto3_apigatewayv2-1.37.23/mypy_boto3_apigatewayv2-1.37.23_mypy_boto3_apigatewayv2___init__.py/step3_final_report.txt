{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS API Gateway V2 via boto3, importing necessary classes and setting up client aliasing.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), creation of session.client('apigatewayv2') for AWS SDK interaction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Static import and alias setup; no data flow from external inputs to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static module with clear structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module importing classes, defining an alias, and exporting symbols for AWS API Gateway V2 interaction. No dynamic data handling, external input processing, or network operations are present. The creation of the client object depends on external AWS credentials but is standard SDK usage. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK wrapper module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static analysis and consensus of the reports confirm its safety.",
