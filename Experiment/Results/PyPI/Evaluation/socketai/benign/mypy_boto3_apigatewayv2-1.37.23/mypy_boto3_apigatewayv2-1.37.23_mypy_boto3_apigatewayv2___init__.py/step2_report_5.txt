  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static module with documentation, imports, and aliasing. No data flows, no external input handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the static nature of the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward imports and documentation. No data flow or external input processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code's simplicity. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard module setup, no dynamic or risky operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on documentation and import structure. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, noting that the creation of the client object via `session.client(\"apigatewayv2\")` depends on external environment, but this is standard SDK behavior and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe mention of potential misuse if external inputs are controlled is valid, but since the code itself does not process external data or include any malicious code, the security risk remains negligible. The overall assessment remains correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is a standard SDK interface module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern is the creation of a client object that depends on external environment and credentials, but this is typical for SDK code and not a security issue per se.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to account for reliance on external environment, but not a security risk)  \n\nThe current scores are reasonable and justified based on static analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured module for AWS API Gateway V2 interaction, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
