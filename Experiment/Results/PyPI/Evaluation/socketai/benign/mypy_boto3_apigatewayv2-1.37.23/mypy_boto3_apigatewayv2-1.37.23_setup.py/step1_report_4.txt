  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2 package to configure its installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file using Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content and passes static configuration data to setuptools.setup() without any external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected. The only file I/O is reading a local README.md file, which is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools to configure package metadata. It reads a local README file for the long description. All data used in setup() are static strings, URLs, or environment-determined requirements. There is no user input, network activity, or code execution beyond standard setup routines. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration without external data sources or suspicious operations.",
