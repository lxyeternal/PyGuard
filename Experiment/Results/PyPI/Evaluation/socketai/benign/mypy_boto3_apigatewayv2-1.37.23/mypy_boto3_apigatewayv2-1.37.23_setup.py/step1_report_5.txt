{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and configure the Python package 'mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The script reads the 'README.md' file for the long description and uses static strings for package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform network operations, file writing beyond reading a local file, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading a local file ('README.md') into a variable for the package description; no untrusted or dynamic data influences the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly follows standard setup script conventions. It reads a static file and uses static strings for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for the long description, and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved. The license, author info, and package data are all static. The script adheres to common Python packaging practices without suspicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks without external dependencies or dynamic input that could be exploited.",
