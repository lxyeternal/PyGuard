  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2 module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data from file read assigned to setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that reads a local README.md file and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. It involves no dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static, well-understood nature. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
