{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2 package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static data in the setup() call (package info, dependencies, classifiers, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The script is a standard setup script for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static package configuration, importing standard libraries, and calling setuptools.setup with fixed package metadata. It reads a README file for description, which is a common practice. No dynamic input, no external data fetching, nor obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
