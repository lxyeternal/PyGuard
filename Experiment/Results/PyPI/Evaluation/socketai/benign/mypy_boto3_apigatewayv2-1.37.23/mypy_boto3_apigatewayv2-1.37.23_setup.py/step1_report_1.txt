{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2 Python package, providing metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses input parameters in setup() for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily reads local files and sets static package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The script uses standard setuptools functions, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package: reading a README file for long description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations involve static data or well-understood package configuration without any dynamic input or risky behavior. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, credential handling, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It securely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious elements.",
