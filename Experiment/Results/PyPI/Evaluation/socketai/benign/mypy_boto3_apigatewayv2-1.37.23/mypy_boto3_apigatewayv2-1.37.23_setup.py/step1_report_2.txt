{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-apigatewayv2', used to install and distribute type annotations for boto3 ApiGatewayV2.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; using hardcoded package details, URLs, author info, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, executes system commands, or processes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The script reads static files and uses predefined package metadata without any external input; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script. It imports modules, reads a markdown file for the description, and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All data is hardcoded or read from static files without any user input or untrusted sources. The URLs and author information are public and consistent with typical package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate, standard package configuration with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behaviors.",
