  "purpose": "CLI interface for segmenting WebVTT files into smaller segments with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments (argv), including command, file path, output directory, target duration, and MPEGTS value.",
  "sinks": "Calls segmenter.segment with provided arguments, which could process the WebVTT file based on input.",
  "flows": "Command line inputs -> argparse parsing -> segmenter.segment function call with arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a command line interface for a segmentation process, accepting parameters such as file path, output directory, target duration, and MPEGTS value. It uses argparse for argument parsing and then calls the segmenter.segment function with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper around the segmenter module without any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI wrapper for a segmentation task. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It relies on the segmenter module, which is outside the scope of this analysis but appears to be a normal dependency.",
