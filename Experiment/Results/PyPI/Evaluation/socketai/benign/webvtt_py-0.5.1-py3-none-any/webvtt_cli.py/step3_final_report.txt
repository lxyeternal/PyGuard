  "purpose": "CLI module for segmenting WebVTT files via command line arguments.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments (file path, output directory, target duration, MPEGTS value).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only passes arguments to the segmenter.segment() function.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI → passed directly to segmenter.segment() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument parsing and delegation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that parses arguments and calls an external segmentation function. It contains no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of segmenter.segment(), which is outside this scope. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or handle untrusted data beyond user input. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with its benign, straightforward nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interface with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security and malware scores are justified and consistent with its simple delegation pattern. The overall security posture is very low risk, contingent on the safety of the external segmenter implementation.",
