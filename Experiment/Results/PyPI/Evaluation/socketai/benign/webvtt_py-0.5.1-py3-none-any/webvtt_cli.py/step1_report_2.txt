{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for segmenting WebVTT files.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse (argv), specifically 'command', 'file', 'output', 'target-duration', and 'mpegts'.",
  "sinks": "Calls segmenter.segment() with user-provided arguments; no direct untrusted data sinks that leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "User inputs (argv) -> argparse parsing -> segmenter.segment() call with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The script is straightforward CLI code.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles command-line argument parsing and then invokes a function from the segmenter module with user-provided parameters. There are no network operations, file writes beyond the segmenter, or dynamic code execution. The default values for target duration and MPEGTS are imported from the segmenter module, which appears standard. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, code injection, or data exfiltration. The overall design is typical for CLI wrappers around functionality implemented elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI interface for WebVTT segmentation. It does not contain malware or security risks on its own. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
