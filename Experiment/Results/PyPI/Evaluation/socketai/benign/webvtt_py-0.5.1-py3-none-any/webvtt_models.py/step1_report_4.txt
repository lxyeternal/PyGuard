{
  "purpose": "Define classes for handling timestamps, captions, and styles for subtitle or caption processing.",
  "sources": "Input strings for parsing timestamps, caption times, and text content, including the 'value' parameter in from_string method and text setters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent to external systems or over network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-provided strings through parsing methods (from_string), setters, and regex processing to class properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious comments, or unusual code patterns. Regex for timestamp parsing is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models for timestamps and captions with methods for parsing, representation, and comparison. It uses regex for timestamp validation and extraction, which appears standard. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code contains only data handling logic without external interactions or side effects. It properly validates input formats and avoids unsafe operations. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of caption and timestamp data models with parsing and validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and contains no malware or obfuscated code.",
