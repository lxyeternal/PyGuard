  "purpose": "Define data models for handling timestamps and captions in media processing, including parsing and formatting.",
  "sources": "re.match() calls for timestamp parsing, class initializers receiving string inputs for timestamps and text.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows into external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into internal data structures (Timestamp, Caption), then formatted or manipulated within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external data transmissions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for managing media timestamps and captions with parsing and formatting methods. The Timestamp class safely parses timestamp strings using regex and validates values. Caption class manages caption text and timing, with no external network or file I/O, and relies on standard Python features. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior. Usage of regular expressions is straightforward and confined to parsing internal data. No untrusted input is directly used in critical system operations or external communications. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of data models for media captions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward data model implementation for timestamps and captions, with input parsing and formatting functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and suitable for inclusion in larger projects focused on media processing.",
