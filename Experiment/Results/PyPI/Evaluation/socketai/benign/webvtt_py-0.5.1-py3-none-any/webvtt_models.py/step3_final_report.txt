  "purpose": "The code provides data models for handling timestamps, captions, and styles in subtitle processing, focusing on parsing, validation, and representation.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for timestamp parsing and voice span detection; internal data attributes for start/end times and text.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings for timestamps and caption text are parsed and validated internally; no external untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; regex used solely for validation; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard regex validation for timestamps, safe data handling for caption text, and straightforward class structures. No external system interactions, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Validation checks for timestamp components are appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified. The regex patterns are simple and confined to internal validation. Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured implementation for caption and timestamp management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
