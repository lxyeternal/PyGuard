{
  "purpose": "The code provides data structures and methods for handling timestamps and captions, likely for subtitle or caption processing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include timestamp strings (via from_string method), caption start/end times, and caption text/lines.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly present; however, untrusted input could affect timestamp parsing, caption text processing, or voice span extraction.",
  "flows": "Timestamp strings are parsed into Timestamp objects; caption text is split and cleaned; voice spans are extracted from caption lines; these data flows are internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. No suspicious network or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling timestamps and captions with validation and parsing functions. The use of regex for timestamp validation and text processing appears standard and safe. No external or untrusted data manipulation beyond normal parsing is evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions perform straightforward data validation and formatting. The presence of comments and type annotations indicates good code clarity. No anomalies suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of caption and timestamp data models with validation and parsing logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and intended for standard caption processing tasks.",
