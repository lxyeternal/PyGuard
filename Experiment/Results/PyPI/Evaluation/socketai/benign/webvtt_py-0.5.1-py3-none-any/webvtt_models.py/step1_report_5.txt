{
  "purpose": "Define classes for handling timestamps, captions, and styles in subtitle or caption processing.",
  "sources": "Input data includes strings for timestamps, caption texts, and style texts. Data is primarily read from parameters during class instantiation and property setters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that handle untrusted data in a way that could cause harm or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through parsing and property setters to internal attributes; no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly processes and formats data related to timestamps and caption texts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures with parsing and validation functions. Timestamp parsing includes regex validation with checks for valid minutes and seconds. Caption and style classes handle text splitting, formatting, and property management without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No network operations, file I/O, or external calls are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be standard, safe, and focused on data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of caption and timestamp models with validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe for use in subtitle processing systems.",
