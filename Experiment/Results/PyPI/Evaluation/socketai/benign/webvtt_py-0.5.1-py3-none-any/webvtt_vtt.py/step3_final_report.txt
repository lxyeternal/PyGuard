  "purpose": "A WebVTT parser and formatter for subtitle files, handling captions, styles, comments, and timing blocks through regex and data classes.",
  "sources": "Reads input lines from text blocks, regex matching for timing, style, and comment patterns.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted WebVTT text; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> validation and pattern matching -> data class instantiation -> output string generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing and formatting of WebVTT subtitle files using regex and data classes. It validates input structure, extracts captions, styles, and comments, and reconstructs the content. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. Validation is basic but sufficient for format correctness. The regex patterns are simple and do not pose known risks. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for WebVTT parsing and formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
