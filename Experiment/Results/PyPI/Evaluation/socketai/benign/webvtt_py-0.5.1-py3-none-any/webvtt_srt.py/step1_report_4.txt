{
  "purpose": "This module parses and writes SRT subtitle files, providing functions to validate, parse, and generate captions from text lines.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'lines' parameter to functions such as parse, is_valid_content, and parse_captions, which are sequences of strings representing lines from an SRT file.",
  "sinks": "The 'write' function outputs the caption data to a file or file-like object, writing formatted subtitle entries.",
  "flows": "Input lines are validated and parsed into caption objects, then formatted and written to an output file; no untrusted data flows from input to output without processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code uses regex for pattern matching, and lambda functions for string replacements; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code validates the structure of SRT lines, extracts timing and caption text, and formats output captions. It uses regex to match timing patterns and replaces commas with periods for time formatting. No external data is read or sent over networks. The write function outputs formatted text with no external command execution or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file operations, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured parser and writer for SRT subtitle files. No malware or malicious intent detected. The security risk level is very low. The implementation performs standard operations for subtitle processing with no signs of malicious activity.",
