{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to parse and write SRT caption files, providing classes and functions for handling caption timing and content.",
  "sources": "Reads input lines from caption files, reads caption text, and reads/writes to file-like objects for output.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed caption data to a file or file-like object.",
  "flows": "Input lines are validated and parsed into caption objects; caption data is written back to files via the write() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of regex is standard and appears safe. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident. The code performs typical parsing and formatting tasks without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code reads lines from caption files, validates format, and parses timing and text data. The SRTCueBlock class uses regex to match cue timing patterns, which is safe. The functions perform straightforward validation and data transformation. The write() function formats caption data and writes to a file or stream without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, is evident. The logic is clean, structured, and focused solely on caption processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard caption file parser and writer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical input validation, parsing, and output formatting for caption data. No malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
