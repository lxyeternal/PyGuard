{
  "purpose": "A straightforward implementation of an SRT caption parser and writer, handling caption timing validation, parsing, and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Input lines for caption blocks, caption text for output",
  "sinks": "Output stream where caption data is written",
  "flows": "Input lines -> validation functions -> parsing into caption objects -> writing formatted captions to output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external utils assumed safe",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing and formatting for SRT captions, using regex for timing validation and simple string replacements. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Validation functions check structure, and the write function outputs caption data without executing external commands. The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Potential risks are limited to the content of captions, which is outside the scope of code analysis. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the low likelihood of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for caption parsing and writing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk pertains only to the content being processed, not the code itself.",
