{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for handling WebVTT subtitle files, including reading and converting subtitle data into various formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.webvtt, .models, segmenter) which are presumably part of the package; no external data input sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs are apparent; the code mainly defines functions and imports, with no explicit data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Defines functions that likely process subtitle data via imported methods, but no explicit data flow from untrusted sources is visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, mainly importing and aliasing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the package's public API by importing functions and classes from local modules and assigning aliases. No data processing, input handling, or external communication is performed here. It appears to be standard package initialization code with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple package interface setup for a WebVTT handling library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
