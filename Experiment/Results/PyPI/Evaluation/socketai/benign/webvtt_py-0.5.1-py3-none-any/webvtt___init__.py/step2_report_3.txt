  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.\n- The code in question is straightforward: setting metadata, importing modules, and creating function aliases.\n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n- The malware scores assigned are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any anomalies, hardcoded secrets (beyond version and author info), or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: providing an interface for WebVTT processing.\n- No evidence of code that could be malicious, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues found. The code appears to be a typical package entry point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThere are no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. It is a standard, benign package initializer.",
