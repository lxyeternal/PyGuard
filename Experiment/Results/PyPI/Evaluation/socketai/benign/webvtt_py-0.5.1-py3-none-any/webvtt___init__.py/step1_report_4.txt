{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a simple interface for the 'webvtt' package, providing access to WebVTT caption processing functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code defines version, author info, and imports functions and classes from other modules within the package. No user input or external data sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions such as network access, file modification, or code execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and exposes functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond version and author info), or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata, imports classes and functions from internal modules, and creates aliases for certain methods. It does not perform any data processing, user input handling, or system modifications. The code appears to serve as a straightforward module interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It simply re-exports functionality for external use.",
