{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple interface for the webvtt package to handle WebVTT caption files, including reading and parsing functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from .webvtt, .segmenter, and .models modules, as well as the author and version metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code defines function aliases that invoke methods from imported modules; no data flow from untrusted sources is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata variables, imports classes and functions, and creates aliases for methods within the package. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations present. All imports are from local modules, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic is included. The code appears to be straightforward package setup code without malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata, imports, and function aliases. No malicious or harmful actions are evident.",
