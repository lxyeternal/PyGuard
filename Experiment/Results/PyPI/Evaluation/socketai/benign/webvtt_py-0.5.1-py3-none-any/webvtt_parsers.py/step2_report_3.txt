  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as subtitle parsers for WebVTT, SRT, SBV.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; no external sinks or dangerous flows are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears safe and straightforward.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent observations.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities noted.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent with the previous reports.\n- Recognizes no external threats or malicious patterns.\n- Mentions a security risk score of 0.2, which seems slightly high given the analysis.\n\n**Observation:**  \n- The code is purely parsing logic with no external interactions. The 0.2 security risk might be slightly overestimated unless considering the potential for misuse of input data, but as per the code, no such issues are evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (possibly slightly high but not unreasonable if considering potential misinterpretation)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous assessments, with high confidence (0.95).\n- No malicious patterns or vulnerabilities detected.\n- No external system calls or dangerous operations.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with prior assessments, high confidence (1).\n- No suspicious behaviors or malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—pure parsing logic with no external or dangerous operations—the risk should be minimal.\n\n**The only point of contention is the third report's security risk score of 0.2.**  \nWhile it's conservative, the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify a **risk score of 0**. A score of 0.2 might suggest some minimal concern, but given the code's scope, it seems unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk:** 0 (more accurate, given the code's nature)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation of subtitle parsers with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores across reports are appropriate, with the minor exception of the third report's security risk score, which should be adjusted downward to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects a secure, benign codebase with no security concerns.",
