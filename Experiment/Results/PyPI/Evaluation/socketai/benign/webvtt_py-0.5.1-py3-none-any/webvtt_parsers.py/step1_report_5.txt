{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract and concrete parsers for subtitle formats (WebVTT, SRT, SBV), parsing subtitle files into structured objects.",
  "sources": "Input: lines of subtitle files provided to parse(), validate(), and iter_blocks_of_lines().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code constructs objects from lines but does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Lines are validated and parsed into blocks; blocks are converted into data objects. No external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard parsing patterns with validation and content extraction. The use of class methods, static methods, and generator functions appears typical for such tasks. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The design relies solely on safe string operations and object construction, with no external data transmission or insecure handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of subtitle format parsers with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and appears safe for use.",
