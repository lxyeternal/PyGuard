  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of subtitle parsers (WebVTT, SRT, SBV) based on an abstract base class.\n- It performs validation, line grouping, and parsing into data objects.\n- No network, file system, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code uses standard Python features, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The report conclusions consistently state the code is safe and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as subtitle parsers.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, consistent with the code's straightforward parsing logic.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the validation and parsing logic's safety.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Discussion:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero (0.2). Given the code's nature, this might be an overestimation unless the scoring system considers the potential for malformed input or validation bypasses. But in this context, no such vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score should probably be 0, aligning with the other reports, unless the scoring system accounts for input validation limitations.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, confirms no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree the code is standard, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The only discrepancy is Report 3's securityRisk score of 0.2, which seems unwarranted given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports are consistent; no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- The code is a straightforward parser with no external system calls, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data beyond validation.  \n- The slight risk score of 0.2 in one report appears unjustified.\n\n- **Estimated risk score: 0**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0               |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated patterns. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero.",
