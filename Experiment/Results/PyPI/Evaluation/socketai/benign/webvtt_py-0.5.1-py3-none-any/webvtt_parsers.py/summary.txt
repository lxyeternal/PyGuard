  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of subtitle parsers with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be 0 or very close to it, reflecting the code's benign nature."
