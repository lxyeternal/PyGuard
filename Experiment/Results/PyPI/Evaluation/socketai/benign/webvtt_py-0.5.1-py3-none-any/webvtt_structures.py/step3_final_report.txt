{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for parsing and representing various caption formats (WebVTT, SRT, SBV, SBV-like), focusing on regex validation, timestamp parsing, and data handling.",
  "sources": "Input lines passed into class methods for parsing caption blocks, comments, and styles.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Lines are matched against regex patterns to extract timestamps, identifiers, and payloads; data flows from input lines through regex matching and parsing into class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; regex patterns are standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution; assertions are used but are typical in parsing code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward caption parsing utility with regex-based validation, timestamp conversions, and string manipulations. It does not perform any network calls, system modifications, or dynamic code execution. Regex patterns are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation. The use of assertions could be a minor concern if disabled, but this is common practice. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The code handles untrusted input cautiously, with exception handling for malformed data. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and no malware threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured caption parsing library with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
