{
  "purpose": "Utility module for file handling and text block iteration, supporting BOM detection and encoding management.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (detect_bom_encoding), file opening in __enter__, and input lines in iter_blocks_of_lines.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, close), reading bytes from files, and processing input lines; no data outputs or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "File path is used in detect_bom_encoding and open functions; lines are processed in iter_blocks_of_lines; data flows from file reads to in-memory processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or hidden code. BOM detection is standard. No malicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for managing file encodings with BOM support and iterating over blocks of non-empty lines. BOM detection reads file headers in binary mode and maps known BOMs to encodings; this is standard practice. The FileWrapper class encapsulates file handling with context management, opening files with specified or detected encodings. The iter_blocks_of_lines function yields blocks of lines separated by blank lines, with no risky operations. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code structure and content are straightforward and intended solely for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages file encodings and line iteration without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
