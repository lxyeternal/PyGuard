  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling with BOM detection and line block iteration.",
  "sources": "File paths used in open() and detect_bom_encoding(), lines input to iter_blocks_of_lines().",
  "sinks": "File opening and reading operations, particularly the 'open' calls with file_path input.",
  "flows": "File path input flows into detect_bom_encoding() and FileWrapper constructor; lines flow into iter_blocks_of_lines().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard file handling procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms for safely opening files with BOM detection and iterating over text blocks. It uses standard Python libraries and safe practices for file IO. No untrusted data handling beyond filename input exists, and there are no network or system command executions. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data exfiltration. The BOM detection and file context management are implemented securely, with no apparent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for file handling and text processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It safely manages file IO with BOM detection and line batching, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
