{
  "purpose": "Utility module for handling file operations with support for Byte Order Mark detection and processing lines in blocks.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths for BOM detection and file opening; reads lines for block iteration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points for untrusted data that could cause data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "detect_bom_encoding reads from files; FileWrapper reads from files; iter_blocks_of_lines processes lines in memory.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. BOM detection is standard. No dynamic code execution or malicious payloads found.",
  "analysis": "The code provides file handling and line processing utilities. BOM detection reads files in binary mode and matches BOM signatures; file reading and opening are standard practices. The line iteration function processes input lines, splitting blocks at blank lines, with no external or untrusted input manipulation that could lead to injection or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard utility for file and text block processing with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe file handling, BOM detection, and line grouping without any suspicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities.",
