  "purpose": "Utility functions for BOM detection, safe file opening with BOM awareness, and iteration over blocks of non-empty lines.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in detect_bom_encoding and FileWrapper.__enter__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; file content is read but not processed insecurely or transmitted",
  "flows": "File path input -> BOM detection or file opening -> line iteration",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard utilities for BOM detection and line processing. It reads files based on user-supplied paths without validation but does not process untrusted data insecurely. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The BOM detection relies on known signatures, and file handling uses context managers correctly. The line iteration yields blocks of non-empty lines, with no suspicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility module for BOM detection and line iteration. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
