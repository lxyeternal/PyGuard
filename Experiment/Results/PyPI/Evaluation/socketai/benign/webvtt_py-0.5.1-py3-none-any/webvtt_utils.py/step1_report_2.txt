  "purpose": "Utility module for handling files with BOM detection and iterating over blocks of lines in a text.",
  "sources": "File input through file paths in FileWrapper class, reading the first few bytes for BOM detection, reading lines from iter_blocks_of_lines function.",
  "sinks": "File open/read operations, potentially reading untrusted files from user-supplied paths.",
  "flows": "detect_bom_encoding reads first bytes from files, FileWrapper initializes and opens files with specified or detected encoding, iter_blocks_of_lines processes input lines into blocks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for BOM detection and reading files safely with context management, along with a generator for processing text lines. It handles files and input streams securely without executing untrusted code or transmitting data externally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply facilitates file handling and line processing in a controlled manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for file handling and line processing. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It operates within expected patterns for such utilities.",
