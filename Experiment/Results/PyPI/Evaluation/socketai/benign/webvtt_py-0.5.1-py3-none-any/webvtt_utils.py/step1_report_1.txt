  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling and text block iteration, primarily for reading files with BOM detection and processing lines into blocks.",
  "sources": "File reading operations, specifically open() calls for detecting BOMs, and reading files in detect_bom_encoding.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or execution effects. The code reads files and processes lines but does not execute or evaluate data.",
  "flows": "File opening -> BOM detection -> Reading file content -> Processing lines into blocks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The BOM detection is standard, and the line iteration is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a utility class for safe file reading with BOM detection. It opens files in a controlled manner, detects encoding BOMs, and allows iteration over text blocks. The implementation appears standard, secure, and free from malicious intent. No external inputs are processed insecurely, and no external connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for file handling and line processing. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured.",
