{
  "purpose": "The code generates subtitle files in WebVTT and SRT formats from provided caption data.",
  "sources": "The code reads caption data from iterable Caption objects passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes formatted subtitle content to file-like objects; no untrusted data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Caption data flows from the input iterable into formatted strings, which are written to files; no external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. The code performs standard formatting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate subtitle files from caption data. It utilizes standard Python string operations and formatting. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The functions operate solely on provided data and write output to files, which is typical for such utilities. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate subtitle formatting utility with no malicious behavior. It safely processes caption data and outputs subtitle files without involving external systems or suspicious operations.",
