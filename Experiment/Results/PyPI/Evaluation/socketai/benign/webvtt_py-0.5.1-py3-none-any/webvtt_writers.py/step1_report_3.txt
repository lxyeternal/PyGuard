{
  "purpose": "The code generates subtitle files in WebVTT and SRT formats from caption data.",
  "sources": "Reading caption data from iterable captions; input data is passed to functions as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writing formatted subtitle content to provided file-like objects.",
  "flows": "Caption data flows from input parameters into formatting functions, then into file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes caption data to produce subtitle formats, utilizing standard string formatting and list extension methods. It reads data from caption objects and writes to file-like objects. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities are apparent, and there are no external data transmissions or obfuscated segments. The use of formatting functions appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of subtitle formatting without malicious intent or security risks. It neither manipulates untrusted data in insecure ways nor performs suspicious operations.",
