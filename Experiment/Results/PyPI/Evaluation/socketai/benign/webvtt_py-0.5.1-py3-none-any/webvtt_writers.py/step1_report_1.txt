{
  "purpose": "The code generates caption files in WebVTT and SRT formats from provided caption data.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the 'captions' iterable parameter, which supplies Caption objects with timing and line information.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code writes to provided file-like objects. No network, system, or data exfiltration activities detected.",
  "flows": "Input captions are processed and formatted into strings, then written to files. No untrusted external data flows into sensitive sinks beyond file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The only notable operation is string formatting and file writing, which are safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for writing captions to files in WebVTT and SRT formats. It processes caption objects, formats timestamps, and outputs caption content. There are no external data fetches, network operations, or suspicious code behaviors. The logic is straightforward and typical for caption file generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign caption formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
