{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate WebVTT and SRT subtitle files from Caption objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads Caption objects from an iterable, specifically accessing caption.identifier, caption.start, caption.end, and caption.lines.",
  "sinks": "The code writes formatted subtitle content to a provided file-like object.",
  "flows": "Sources (Caption attributes) are processed to produce subtitle formats; output is written to files via f.write or f.writelines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated code, and no network operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily formats caption data into subtitle formats. It reads Caption object attributes and formats strings accordingly, then writes to provided file objects. The code contains no dynamic code execution, network communication, or system modifications. It uses standard string formatting and list operations. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of subtitle file generation with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
