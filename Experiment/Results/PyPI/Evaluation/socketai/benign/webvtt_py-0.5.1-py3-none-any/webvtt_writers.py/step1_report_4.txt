{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate caption files in WebVTT and SRT formats from caption data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads caption objects and their properties, particularly caption identifiers, start/end times, and text lines.",
  "sinks": "The code writes formatted caption data to file objects; no external untrusted input is directly written without validation.",
  "flows": "Caption data (identifiers, times, text) flows from Caption objects to formatted string outputs, then written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated logic observed. No suspicious network or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply formats caption data into standard subtitle formats. It processes caption objects to produce textual output. No user input, environment variables, or external system interactions are involved. Functions generate content based on caption data and write to provided file streams. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation for exporting caption data into standard formats. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
