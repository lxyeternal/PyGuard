  "purpose": "Generate caption files in WebVTT and SRT formats from Caption objects.",
  "sources": "Caption object attributes: identifier, start, end, lines",
  "sinks": "File write operations; formatting strings for caption timing and identifiers",
  "flows": "Caption attributes are formatted into strings and written to files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; string replacement in timestamps is standard formatting",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly formats caption data into subtitle files without external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The only minor point is the timestamp formatting, which is standard. The code handles data safely, and the operations are simple string manipulations and file writes. External caption data could contain malicious content, but the code itself does not process or interpret such content beyond formatting. The reports correctly assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with very low security risk scores of 0 or 0.1, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for caption formatting with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores in the reports are accurate; malware and obfuscation should be 0, and security risk should be 0. Given the simplicity and safety of the code, no adjustments are necessary.",
