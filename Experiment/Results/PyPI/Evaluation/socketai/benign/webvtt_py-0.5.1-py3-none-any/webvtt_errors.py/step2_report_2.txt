  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for error handling in Python projects.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The exception classes are simple and serve as error indicators, which is common practice.\n- No logic, data flow, or external data handling exists that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's nature, even a minimal 0.1 seems slightly overestimated; the code itself does not introduce any security risk.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only point of note is the securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 4. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, this should be 0 to be consistent with the others.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The overall security risk is negligible; the code is safe.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n- The securityRisk score should be uniformly 0 across all reports for consistency.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are accurate in their assessments, with a minor adjustment needed for the securityRisk score in report 4.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate, except for the minor securityRisk in report 4, which should be 0.\n- Overall, the code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
