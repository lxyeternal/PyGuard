  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file and caption formatting, and filename presence.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear class definitions and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, each with a descriptive docstring. There are no input/output operations, data processing, external communication, or dynamic behaviors. The code is a standard pattern for error handling in Python. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. Minor deviations, such as a risk score of 0.1 in one report, are slightly overestimations given the code's simplicity. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
