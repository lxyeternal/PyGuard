  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a module related to file and caption processing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code only defines exception classes with docstrings; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. There are no input, output, or data processing operations, nor any dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The classes are straightforward and standard in Python for error handling. No indicators of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be part of a larger project, focusing solely on error definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. The overall security risk is very low.",
