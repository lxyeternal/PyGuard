  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code**:  \nAll reports agree that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, safe, and standard for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk score**: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is slightly higher but still very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5)**:  \nNo report suggests any reason to assign a high risk score. The code is purely definitional, with no dynamic or external behaviors that could pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \nSince no malicious activity is detected, the malware score remains at 0 across all reports.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static nature, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. The minimal security risk (0.1 in one report) could be considered slightly overcautious but still within reason given the overall benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative in the security risk score.\n\n**My recommended scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
