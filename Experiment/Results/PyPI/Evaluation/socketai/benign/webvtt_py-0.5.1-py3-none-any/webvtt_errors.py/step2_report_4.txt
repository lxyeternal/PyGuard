  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no input sources, data processing, output sinks, or external communications.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is present.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard pattern for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Since the code is purely structural with no data handling or external interactions, a score of 0 is more appropriate. The 0.1 might be slightly overestimating the risk but is still minimal.\n   - **Confidence:** All are at 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions, with no side effects or hidden behaviors.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted; 0 is most appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is non-malicious and standard.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified. The only minor discrepancy is the 0.1 security risk in report 4, which could be more accurately set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment and My Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no vulnerabilities)\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes. All reports correctly identify this. Minor adjustments to the security risk score could be made, but overall, the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**",
