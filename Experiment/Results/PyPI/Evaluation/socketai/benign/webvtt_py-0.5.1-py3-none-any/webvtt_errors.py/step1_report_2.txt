  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file and caption formats.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external data handling, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink since the code only defines exception classes without data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code only declares three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, each with a descriptive docstring. There are no data reads, no external interactions, and no suspicious behaviors. No code execution, input handling, or side effects are present. It is a standard pattern for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, non-malicious snippet defining custom exceptions for error handling. It presents no security risks, malware behavior, or suspicious anomalies.",
