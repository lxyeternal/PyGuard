  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, output operations, or external communications.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n   - The conclusions that the code is safe and non-malicious are justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no operational logic, there is no basis for a high risk score.\n   - The reported scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a standard, safe pattern.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, safe set of custom exception class definitions, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
