  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file and caption formatting issues.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of three custom exception class definitions, each inheriting from Python's base Exception class. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no dynamic or malicious code elements are present. The classes serve as specific error types for a larger application, which is a standard practice and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and intended for error handling. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
