  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file and caption formatting issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes without any execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly declares custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, serving as specific error indicators. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are simple and contain only docstrings, indicating standard usage for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could lead to malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
