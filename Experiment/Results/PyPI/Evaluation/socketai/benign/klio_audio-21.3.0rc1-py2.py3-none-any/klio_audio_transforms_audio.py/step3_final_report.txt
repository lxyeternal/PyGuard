{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes that wrap librosa functions for audio loading, transformation (STFT, spectrograms, MFCCs, mel spectrograms), and visualization, intended for use in data pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input data from item.payload (bytes or numpy.ndarray) and item.element (bytes decoded to string).",
  "sinks": "Outputs include numpy arrays, matplotlib figures, or generator yields; no external network or file system activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input payloads/elements through librosa processing functions and into visualization or array outputs, without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of audio processing using well-known libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. Input data is processed internally, and outputs are standard data structures or plots. No external network activity, credential handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is well-structured, documented, and uses standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs standard audio processing tasks within a data pipeline context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into it.",
