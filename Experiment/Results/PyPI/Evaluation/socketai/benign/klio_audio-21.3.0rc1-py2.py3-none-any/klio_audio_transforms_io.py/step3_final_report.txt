  "purpose": "Classes for loading binary files from GCS and uploading plots to GCS within an Apache Beam pipeline, primarily used for audio processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading input message elements (decoded as UTF-8 strings), configuration data from 'job_config.data.inputs' and 'job_config.data.outputs', and GCS paths constructed from these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Writing binary data to GCS files, saving plot images to GCS as specified in configuration.",
  "flows": "Input message element -> decode -> construct filename/path -> open GCS client -> read/write data -> yield output path or data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Validation enforces single input/output configuration, which is standard but limits flexibility.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard GCS client APIs for file I/O, with validation to ensure proper configuration. It performs straightforward path construction, decoding message elements, and reading/writing files. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. Validation and logging are appropriate. The code's logic is clear, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's simplicity and use of standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
