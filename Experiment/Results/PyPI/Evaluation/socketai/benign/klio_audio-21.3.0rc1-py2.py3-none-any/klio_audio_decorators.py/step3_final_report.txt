  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization utility for Apache Beam messages, handling pickle and numpy payloads with decorators for wrapping processing functions.",
  "sources": "KlioMessage payloads, especially in functions like _pickle_load, _numpy_load, and decorator wrappers that process message payloads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data is deserialized via pickle, but no external sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from KlioMessage payloads through load functions (pickle or numpy), into user-defined processing functions, then back through dump functions, possibly yielding tagged outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of pickle is a security concern but standard for controlled pipeline environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward serialization utility with error handling, decorators, and support for numpy and pickle payloads. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is pickle deserialization, which is acknowledged but acceptable in trusted contexts. The code structure and logic are clear and standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured serialization utility for Apache Beam pipelines. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security risk is the use of pickle, which is a known concern but acceptable within controlled environments. The overall security posture is low risk.",
