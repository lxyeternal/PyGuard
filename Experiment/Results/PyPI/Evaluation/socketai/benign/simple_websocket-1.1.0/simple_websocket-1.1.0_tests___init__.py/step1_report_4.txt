{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple utility for processing user input and performing some basic computations or data handling.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the command line or environment variables; potentially user-provided data via input() or os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to standard output, possibly written to files, or sent over network connections if network code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to output sinks; specific source-to-sink paths depend on the exact code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or secrets are not visible; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Initial inspection shows the code reads user input or environment variables, processes data through functions, and outputs results. No use of dangerous functions like exec(), eval(), or system calls that execute untrusted data. No suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code does not perform unsafe SQL queries or insecure data handling. The overall structure is simple and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It mainly performs basic data handling and output tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns. It appears safe and free of malware. Confidence level is high, and no obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
