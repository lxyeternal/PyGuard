{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the simple_websocket library, specifically testing server behavior, message handling, connection management, and protocol negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include mock request headers, simulated WebSocket messages (TextMessage, BytesMessage, Ping, Pong), and mock connection reads. No untrusted external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Message send operations via wsock.write, server state changes, and exception raising upon connection closure or errors.",
  "flows": "Test functions generate mock WebSocket events and simulate server behaviors, with flows from mock input (messages, events) to wsock.write calls and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is predominantly standard testing patterns, with extensive mocking for isolated testing. No unusual code behaviors or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a comprehensive suite of unit tests using asyncio and mocks to evaluate server behavior in various scenarios. It mocks network connections, WebSocket events, and message flows to validate server responses, message handling, and protocol negotiation. The tests verify correct behavior and exception handling without any suspicious or malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of mocks ensures no real external data or network activity occurs, and all code appears to be standard test code for a WebSocket server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for a WebSocket server library, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code. It uses mocks to simulate network and WebSocket interactions, focusing on functional correctness. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
