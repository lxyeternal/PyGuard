{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for an asynchronous WebSocket server, utilizing mocks to simulate network interactions, message handling, protocol negotiation, and connection lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "Headers in mock requests, mock WebSocket connection objects, and simulated incoming messages (TextMessage, BytesMessage, Ping, Pong).",
  "sinks": "Methods like wsock.write and server.send, which are used to send data frames or control messages during tests.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (mocked messages and headers) flow through the server's message processing routines, ultimately triggering write calls on the mock WebSocket object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code strictly employs mocks and standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify WebSocket server behavior. It uses mocks to simulate network I/O, ensuring no real network activity or data exfiltration occurs. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low risk score (around 0.1) reflects the benign nature of test code. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The tests cover connection handling, message reception, ping-pong, protocol negotiation, and closure, all within a controlled mock environment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, well-structured test suite for a WebSocket server library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified, indicating minimal supply chain risk.",
