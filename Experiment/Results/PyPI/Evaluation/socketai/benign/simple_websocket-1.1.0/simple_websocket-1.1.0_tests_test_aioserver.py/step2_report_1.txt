  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes comprehensive unit tests for the WebSocket server, with mock events and headers. Accurate.\n- **Sinks:** Mentions the send/write methods only used for testing, which aligns with the code.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. Uses mocks appropriately.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a standard test suite.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focused on testing server behavior with mocks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard testing patterns, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard test code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on testing message handling, ping-pong, and protocol negotiation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses mock wsock.write for sending frames, which is normal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. All interactions are within test scope.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe test suite.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing connection, message exchange, and protocol negotiation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses mock wsock.write, no real network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe test code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, testing server behaviors with mocks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No real system access, just mock interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify malware=0, which aligns with the code—no malicious payloads or behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code is purely test code with no real network or system access.\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — minimal, as the code is solely for testing, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk in this test suite.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, well-structured test suite for a WebSocket server, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
