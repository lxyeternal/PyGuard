  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard WebSocket implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor typo is a bug but not a security concern. The environment-based socket extraction is typical for server frameworks and does not introduce malicious risks. The code is not obfuscated and does not contain malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low."
