{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket client and server, managing WebSocket handshake, message sending/receiving, and connection lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from network sockets (self.sock.recv), HTTP headers from environment (environ), and user input data in send() and handshake() methods.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over sockets (self.sock.send), potentially including WebSocket frames (e.g., Ping, CloseConnection), and can send HTTP headers during handshake.",
  "flows": "Input data from network sockets flow into wsproto's receive_data method, which generates events. Outgoing data is sent via sock.send, triggered by events (e.g., Ping, CloseConnection, handshake responses). User data passed to send() is packaged and transmitted via sock.send.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious imports; no indications of backdoors or hidden malicious code. Environment-based socket extraction in Server.accept() handles various WSGI servers securely. No malicious payloads or hidden network communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages WebSocket connections, performing handshakes, message handling, and connection closures with proper event-driven logic. It includes typical socket and threading operations, with standard security practices such as SSL wrapping for secure connections. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The design relies on trusted libraries (wsproto, socket, ssl) and standard practices. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or sabotage is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of WebSocket client and server logic, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. It follows standard protocols and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
