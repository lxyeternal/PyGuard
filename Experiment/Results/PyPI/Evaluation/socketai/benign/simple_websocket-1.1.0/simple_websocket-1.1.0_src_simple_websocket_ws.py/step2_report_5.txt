  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code, the logical reasoning, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard WebSocket implementation with connection handling, message management, and protocol negotiation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for WebSocket servers/clients, with no suspicious patterns. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the context—possible environment manipulation or misconfiguration could pose minor risks, but nothing malicious.\n- **Conclusion**: The report's conclusion and scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the environment variable handling for socket extraction, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated. Also notes a typo 'extra_headeers' but considers it a bug, not malicious.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment**: The analysis is correct. The typo is minor and does not impact security. The environment variable handling is standard but could be a vector if the environment is compromised—however, this is typical for server setups.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious activity, just a minor bug. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the correct management of WebSocket protocol, handshake, and message flow. No suspicious data or behavior detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score reflects the standard nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion**: The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, notes the standard handling of WebSocket connections, with no malicious code or backdoors. Mentions that data is transmitted unencrypted, but this is inherent to WebSocket protocol and not malicious.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The unencrypted data flow is typical for WebSocket but could be a security concern in some contexts; however, not malicious per se.\n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Reiterates the standard implementation, with mention of a typo ('extra_headeers') but no malicious code or obfuscation. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning aligns with the code content. The minor typo does not impact security.\n- **Conclusion**: The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, which is consistent; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor concerns such as environment manipulation or minor bugs, but no serious vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to environment variable handling and minor typos, but nothing exploitable or malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Risk           | 0.1            |\n\nThe overall evaluation indicates that this code is a standard, well-implemented WebSocket library component with no malicious intent or security sabotage evident from the provided snippets and reports.",
