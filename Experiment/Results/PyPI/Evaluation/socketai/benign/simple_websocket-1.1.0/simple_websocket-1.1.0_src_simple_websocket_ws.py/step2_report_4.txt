  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Standard WebSocket client/server implementation; no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors observed.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low, considering the environment variable handling for socket extraction, which is typical)\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The report correctly notes no malicious activity.\n  - The code relies on standard libraries and patterns.\n  - No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with additional mention of a typo in 'extra_headeers'.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (still low)\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The typo 'extra_headeers' is noted, which could cause runtime bugs but not security issues.\n  - No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are consistent; minor typo doesn't impact security risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Standard WebSocket protocol handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code performs expected WebSocket operations.\n  - No external or malicious network activity.\n- **Verdict**: Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Standard WebSocket implementation; no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, but notes that data is transmitted unencrypted (which is standard for WebSocket but not inherently malicious).\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (considering unencrypted transmission, but that’s a known characteristic, not a flaw)\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No signs of sabotage or malicious code.\n  - No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as others; standard WebSocket code with a minor typo.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No malicious activity.\n  - The typo is minor.\n- **Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores**: Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the standard nature of the code and the environment variable handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- No higher risk scores are justified given the code's functionality and the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The only minor concern is the typo 'extra_headeers', which does not impact security but should be corrected for code quality.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to environment-based socket extraction, which is standard but could be misused if environment variables are maliciously manipulated)\n\n**Summary**: The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented WebSocket library with no malicious intent or supply chain issues. The low risk score is justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: Always ensure environment variables used for socket extraction are secured and validated in deployment environments to prevent potential misuse, but this is a deployment concern rather than a code issue.",
