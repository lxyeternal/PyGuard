  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard WebSocket implementation, handling connections, messages, and protocol negotiation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and environment variables appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, malicious intent, or supply chain risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with additional note of a typo in 'extra_headeers' (likely 'extra_headers'). No malicious activity or backdoors. The environment variable socket extraction is standard but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated—though this is typical for server environments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate WebSocket code, minor typo, no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent, and the risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard WebSocket handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation. Uses environment variables for socket extraction, which is typical but could be a vector if environment is compromised—though not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned, appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with emphasis on the standard implementation and no suspicious flows. Slight mention that data is transmitted unencrypted, but this is inherent to WebSocket protocols, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, minor typo in 'extra_headeers' noted. No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard protocol handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No evidence.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk assessment:** Very low, primarily due to environment variable handling and minor typo, which do not pose security threats.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard WebSocket implementation, with no backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The environment variable socket extraction is typical for server frameworks; unless the environment is maliciously manipulated, it does not introduce risk.\n- The typo 'extra_headeers' is a minor bug, not a security concern.\n- No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to environment reliance and minor typo, not security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The overall assessment indicates this code is a legitimate, standard WebSocket implementation with no supply chain or security concerns based on the provided reports.",
