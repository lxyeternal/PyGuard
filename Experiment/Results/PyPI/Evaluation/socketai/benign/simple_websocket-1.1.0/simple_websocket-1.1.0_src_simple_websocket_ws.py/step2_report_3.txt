  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report accurately describes the code's purpose—WebSocket client/server with connection, message, and protocol handling. Sources and sinks involve socket data, environment variables, headers, and WebSocket frames.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The environment variable handling for socket extraction is standard for server integrations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical, well-structured WebSocket implementation. No malicious behavior, secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables for socket extraction and standard WebSocket handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Noted typo in variable name `'extra_headeers'`—a minor bug but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The implementation is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The typo is a minor bug, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with prior reports, describing socket reads/writes and WebSocket event processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; standard socket and SSL usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate WebSocket implementation with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same pattern—socket data, environment variables, WebSocket frames.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. Slight concern about unencrypted data, but standard for WebSocket.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Minor typo `'extra_headeers'`, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard WebSocket code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mostly around 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical security considerations for network code, but no significant vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious intent or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Slightly elevated due to network operations but generally low.\n\n**Final Justification:** The code is a standard, well-structured WebSocket implementation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Minor bugs (typos) do not impact security. The environment-based socket extraction is typical for server setups and does not introduce malicious risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. I would maintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and keep the risk score at around 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical operational risks without malicious intent.",
