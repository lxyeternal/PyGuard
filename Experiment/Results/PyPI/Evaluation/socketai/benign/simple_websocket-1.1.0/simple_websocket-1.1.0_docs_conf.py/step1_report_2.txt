  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, and theme options.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and sys modules, sys.path modification, configuration variables assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or inputs; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Import and sys.path insertion are static setup actions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Configuration is standard and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard documentation configuration tasks: importing modules, setting project info, defining extensions and paths, and customizing HTML options. It modifies sys.path to include a relative directory, which is typical for local module documentation. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code adheres to standard Sphinx configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
