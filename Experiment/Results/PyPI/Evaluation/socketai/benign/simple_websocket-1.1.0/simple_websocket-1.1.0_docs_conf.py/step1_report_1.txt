  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder for the 'simple-websocket' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys) and sys.path modification, static paths, and theme options.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The sys.path insertion modifies module search path, which is common in documentation setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file that sets up project info, extensions, paths, theme, and static assets. It imports os and sys modules and modifies sys.path to include a relative source directory, which is typical for documenting local modules. No input data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The static paths and theme options are straightforward configuration parameters. The code adheres to common documentation setup patterns without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply configures documentation build settings.",
