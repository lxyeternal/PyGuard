  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder to generate project documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and sys modules; sys.path modification; static file paths; extension lists; theme options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data handling, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections. All code is standard configuration syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file. It imports os and sys, modifies sys.path, and sets various documentation options, including theme and static files. There are no dynamic inputs, no network communications, and no code execution or data manipulation that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for Sphinx config files, with no suspicious or anomalous elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely sets up documentation build parameters without involving external data, secrets, or executable logic that could be exploited.",
