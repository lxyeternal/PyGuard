  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just import statements with no data processing or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score?** Zero risk is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Only import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score seems slightly elevated for just imports.\n- **Justification:** Since there's no data flow or runtime behavior, a risk score of 0.1 may be slightly high; perhaps 0.05 is more appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Slightly overestimated risk, but still minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Simple import statements.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — again, a minimal risk score justified.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Standard package interface code.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are benign import statements with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are mostly at 0.1, which might be slightly high for such trivial code. Given the absence of data flow, runtime behavior, or external input, a risk score of around 0.05 would be more precise.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1, but leaning towards 0.05 given the minimal nature.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The risk scores could be slightly lowered, but overall, they reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** Since this code is only import statements, it inherently carries very low security risk.",
