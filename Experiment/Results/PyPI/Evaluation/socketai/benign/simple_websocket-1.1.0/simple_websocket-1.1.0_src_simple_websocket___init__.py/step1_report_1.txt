{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and errors related to WebSocket and asynchronous WebSocket communication, likely part of a networking library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ws, .aiows, and .errors",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; purely import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow; only imports, no runtime data processing or external input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and error definitions from local modules. There is no data processing, no handling of user input, environment variables, or external data sources. The presence of websocket and asynchronous modules suggests networking functionality, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement block for a networking library's modules and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
