{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes related to WebSocket and asynchronous communication, as well as error handling, likely for use in a larger networking or communication library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package: .ws, .aiows, and .errors, which may contain additional logic or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet; potential sink points depend on how these imported classes are used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes for WebSocket server/client and error types, which could be used later to handle or process network data, but no explicit data flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns are present. The import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes related to WebSocket communication and error handling from local modules. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. Since these are only imports, further analysis would require inspecting the imported modules themselves. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import operations for a networking or WebSocket library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it appears benign.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
