{
  "purpose": "The code imports server, client, and error classes related to WebSocket and asynchronous communication, likely for establishing network connections.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this minimal code; imports do not involve data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains import statements from internal modules, indicating modular structure for network communication components. There are no evident signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in these imports. Since it’s only imports, the code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other operations that could pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a larger project, responsible for importing WebSocket and asynchronous connection classes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment.",
