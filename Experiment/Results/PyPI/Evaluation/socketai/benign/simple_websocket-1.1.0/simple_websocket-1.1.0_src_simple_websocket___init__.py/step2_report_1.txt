  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- The code only contains import statements from local modules related to WebSocket and errors.\n- No data flow, no suspicious patterns, no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1, aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Assessment**: The report's conclusion and scoring are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**:\n- Similar to Report 1, only import statements from internal modules.\n- No data processing or external inputs.\n- Malware score: 0, consistent.\n- Security risk: 0.1, which is low but perhaps considering the import of networking classes, slightly elevated. Still, since no actual network activity or code execution is shown, this seems acceptable.\n- Confidence: 1, justified.\n\n**Assessment**: The score seems reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**:\n- Again, only import statements, with mention of the 'noqa: F401' comment indicating intentional imports.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- Malware: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1, consistent with a benign package interface.\n- Confidence: 0.9, slightly lower but still high, acknowledging that deeper inspection of imported modules could reveal more.\n\n**Assessment**: The scores align with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**:\n- Similar to previous reports, only import statements with no data flow or anomalies.\n- No malware or security issues.\n- Malware: 0, correct.\n- Security risk: 0.1, justified.\n- Confidence: 0.9, reasonable.\n\n**Assessment**: No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**:\n- Same pattern: straightforward imports, no suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1, justified.\n\n**Assessment**: The scoring and analysis are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely import statements, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flow.\n- The malware scores are all zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1), consistent with minimal exposure from import statements alone.\n- Confidence levels are high, appropriate for the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nBased on the analysis, I concur with the scores assigned in all reports. The code fragment is benign, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (minimal, due to being a package interface with no active data flow)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's simplicity.",
