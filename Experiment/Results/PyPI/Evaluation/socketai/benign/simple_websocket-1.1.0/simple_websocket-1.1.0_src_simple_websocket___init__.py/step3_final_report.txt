  "purpose": "Import classes and error definitions related to WebSocket and asynchronous WebSocket operations, likely for exposing an API or internal use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports of Server, Client, AioServer, AioClient, ConnectionError, ConnectionClosed",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "None; static imports without data flow or runtime behavior",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with suppression comments",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no data processing, network activity, or external inputs. The use of '# noqa: F401' indicates intentional exposure of classes for API purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The minimal nature of the code suggests negligible security risk, and the malware score is appropriately zero. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects the minimal threat posed by static import statements. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
