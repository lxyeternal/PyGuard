  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements asyncio-based WebSocket client and server classes (`AioClient`, `AioServer`) using the `wsproto` library.\n- Handles handshake, message sending/receiving, protocol negotiation, pings, and connection closure.\n- Uses standard network and protocol handling, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- Contains a minor typo in attribute `extra_headeers` (likely meant to be `extra_headers`), but this is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No critical issues are present. The typo `extra_headeers` is a minor bug but not security-related.\n\n### Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:\n- **Any flaws in reports?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. They note the typo but consider it non-impactful.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and no detected vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard WebSocket implementation without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n- **Any signs of supply chain attack or malicious code?**  \n  No. The code uses standard libraries, handles data securely, and does not contain hidden code or external connections.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent, considering minor typo but no security impact)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as the code is a typical WebSocket implementation with no malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate, standard WebSocket client/server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo in `extra_headeers` is benign and does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscation scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1).  \n- No further action needed based on these reports.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor dependencies (`wsproto`) for updates or known vulnerabilities, but within this code review, no issues are present.",
