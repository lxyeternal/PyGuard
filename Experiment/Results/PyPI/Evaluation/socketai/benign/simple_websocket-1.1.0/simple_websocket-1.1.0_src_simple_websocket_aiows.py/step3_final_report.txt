{
  "purpose": "This code implements asyncio-based WebSocket client and server classes using the wsproto library, handling handshake, message exchange, protocol negotiation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from network sockets (rsock.read), request headers during handshake, and incoming WebSocket events.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via wsock.write, including handshake responses, messages, pings, and close frames; no external data exfiltration or network connections are suspicious.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from network sockets into wsproto's receive_data, processed into events; outgoing data flows from wsproto's send method into wsock.write; handshake and message handling follow standard protocols.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in attribute 'extra_headeers' instead of 'extra_headers'; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asyncio WebSocket implementation using wsproto, with proper handling of handshake, message flow, and connection states. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious external communication are present. The minor typo does not impact security. The code follows established patterns and uses trusted libraries. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket client/server implementation with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the minor typo is benign.",
