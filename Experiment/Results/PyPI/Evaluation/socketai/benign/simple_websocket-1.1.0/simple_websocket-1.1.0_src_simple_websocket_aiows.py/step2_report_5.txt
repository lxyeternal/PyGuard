  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, asyncio-based WebSocket client/server implementation using wsproto.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious external communications.\n- Minor issues like a typo in 'extra_headeers' are noted but deemed benign.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malware signals are identified.\n- The code's logic aligns with typical WebSocket handling patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:** None of the reports find any malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Secrets or Credentials:** No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- **Suspicious External Communication:** No signs of data exfiltration or covert channels.\n- **Typos or Minor Bugs:** The attribute 'extra_headeers' appears to be a typo (likely intended as 'extra_headers'), but it does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues of malicious code or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in Logic, Reasoning, or Summary:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the code as a legitimate WebSocket implementation.\n- The only minor flaw is the typo 'extra_headeers', which is benign but should be corrected for code clarity.\n- No reasoning errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness:\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of **0**, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the lack of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are **0**, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Malware Score Justification:\n\n- All reports agree malware = 0, which is justified.\n- No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or covert channels are present.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is standard and benign, which aligns with the code review.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is based on the code structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, primarily due to minor typo and standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\n**The code is a legitimate, standard WebSocket implementation with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain risk.**",
