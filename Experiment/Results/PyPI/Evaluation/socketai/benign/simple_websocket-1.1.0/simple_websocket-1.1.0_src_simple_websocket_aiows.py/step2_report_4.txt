  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard WebSocket client/server operation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external communication, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable given the low security risk but some caution due to complexity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar standard description.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes a typo in 'extra_headeers' attribute, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; typo is a minor coding mistake.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard WebSocket handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Same typo ('extra_headeers'), no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Clear WebSocket protocol management.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious network activity or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes typical WebSocket connection flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting low but non-zero concern. Given the code's standard nature, these are reasonable.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Typos ('extra_headeers'):** Minor and benign, no security impact.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured WebSocket implementation using asyncio and wsproto. It does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are justified, considering the complexity and network handling.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard implementation with minor typo)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no changes are necessary. The code appears safe and legitimate from a supply chain security perspective.",
