  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's WebSocket client/server implementation, matching the code structure.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Uses standard libraries and protocols.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk (0.2), malware score (0), obfuscated (0), consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly summarizes data flow and event handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Mentions a typo 'extra_headeers'—this is benign, a minor typo, not security-impacting.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk (0.1), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Same minor typo ('extra_headeers') noted, no security impact.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0.2), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious external connections or code injection, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Risk score 0.2, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly identifies the code as legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Matches code structure.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0.1), malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code validation:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, legitimate WebSocket implementation.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, risk scores:** All are zero or very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential issues:** Minor typo ('extra_headeers') in headers attribute, but this is benign and does not impact security.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No external malicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The implementation follows standard WebSocket protocol handling.\n- The risk scores assigned are appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, due to minor typo, but no security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate WebSocket implementation with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The existing reports' scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure dependencies like `wsproto` are sourced from trusted repositories, but based on the code and reports, there are no malicious modifications.",
