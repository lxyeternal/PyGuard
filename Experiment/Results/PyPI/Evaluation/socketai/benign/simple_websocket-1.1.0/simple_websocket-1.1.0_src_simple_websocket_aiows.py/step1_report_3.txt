{
  "purpose": "This code implements asynchronous WebSocket client and server classes for handling WebSocket connections, including handshake, message sending/receiving, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP headers and URL parsing, socket reads for network communication, and request parameters for subprotocols.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via wsock.write() which writes to network sockets; input buffers store incoming messages; handshake data is sent over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network socket reads into ws.receive_data(), then through event handling logic, potentially resulting in messages being stored in input_buffer; outgoing messages flow from send() or close() methods into ws.send() and then to network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of detailed WebSocket protocol handling code appears standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; extra headers are stored and sent, but no evidence of secret leakage. Minor typo in attribute 'extra_headeers' (likely intended as 'extra_headers'), but no security implication. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected; no code injection or reverse shell activity.",
  "analysis": "The code manages WebSocket connections asynchronously, handling handshake, message exchange, and connection closure. No suspicious external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or obfuscated payloads. It respects WebSocket protocol standards and uses standard library functions for network communication. There is no evidence of malware, such as covert data transmission or system exploitation. The only potential concern is the typo in 'extra_headeers', which is a benign coding mistake with no security impact.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of WebSocket client and server classes with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It efficiently handles WebSocket protocol mechanics without any suspicious activity or backdoors. Overall, the code is safe from supply chain malicious intent.",
