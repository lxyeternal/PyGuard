  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard WebSocket implementation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It uses well-known libraries (`wsproto`) and standard network handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk score is low, justified by the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, legitimate code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical WebSocket server with no signs of malicious activity. It notes a typo `'extra_headeers'`, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk is slightly higher but still low, justified by standard protocol handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, standard implementation.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The typo is minor and not security-impacting. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard WebSocket client/server with no malicious behavior. Notes a typo `'extra_headeers'` but no security impact.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Justified given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is valid. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward WebSocket implementation with no suspicious external activity or hidden malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard WebSocket handling with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a typical, well-structured WebSocket implementation using `wsproto`. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2, justified by the standard, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Low, justified by the code's benign, standard WebSocket implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Notes:\n\n- The typo `'extra_headeers'` appears in the client code attribute but does not introduce security issues; it's a minor bug.\n- No external or hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident.\n- The code's purpose aligns with standard WebSocket communication, with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Score |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Malware      | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated   | 0.0             |\n| Risk         | 0.2             |\n\nThe overall assessment is that this code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
