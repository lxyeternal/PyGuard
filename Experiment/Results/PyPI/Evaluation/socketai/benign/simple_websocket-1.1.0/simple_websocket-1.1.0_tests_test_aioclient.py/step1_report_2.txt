  "purpose": "Unit tests for the asynchronous WebSocket client implementation in the simple_websocket library.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (asyncio, unittest, pytest), and mocks network connections and WebSocket events.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data leaks are present. Mocks simulate network interactions without real data transmission.",
  "flows": "Test methods create mock connections, invoke client methods, and verify behaviors, with no external data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. Code appears to be standard test code with mocking and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides unit tests for a WebSocket client, mocking network interactions to verify functionality. It does not include any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All code is focused on testing and mocking, with no network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Usage of mocks ensures no actual network connections or data leaks occur. Overall, the code is legitimate test code with no security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a WebSocket client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for testing purposes, with safe mocking practices.",
