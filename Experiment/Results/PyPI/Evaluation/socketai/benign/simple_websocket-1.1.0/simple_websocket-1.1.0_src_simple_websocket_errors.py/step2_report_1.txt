  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes related to WebSocket connection errors, importing `CloseReason` from an external library.\n   - The classes simply store attributes and format messages; there is no data processing, network activity, or external input handling.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and aligns with standard exception class definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 is justified due to the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes without any data handling or external interactions, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities; they do not rely on assumptions but on direct code analysis.\n   - No false positives or overestimations are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions for WebSocket error handling. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
