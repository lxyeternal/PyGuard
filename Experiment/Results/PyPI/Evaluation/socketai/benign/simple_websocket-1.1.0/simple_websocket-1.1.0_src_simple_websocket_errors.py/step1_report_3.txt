  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors and closures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an external library and defines three custom exception classes related to WebSocket errors. These classes include optional parameters and inherit from RuntimeError, but do not perform any operations beyond simple initialization and message formatting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. No input sources, sinks, or data flows are present, and no signs of obfuscation or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for WebSocket connection handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears safe and standard for such use cases.",
