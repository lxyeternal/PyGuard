  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; exception classes are used for control flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, used for signaling WebSocket connection errors and closure reasons. It imports a constant CloseReason from an external library but does not process or handle any data. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is involved. The exception messages include optional parameters but do not pose security concerns. Overall, the code appears straightforward and does not contain any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for WebSocket error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
