  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to WebSocket errors. The code imports a specific class (`CloseReason`) but does not process or handle any data dynamically. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network operations. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. There are no logical errors or flaws in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external data handling, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores of 0 align well with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for WebSocket error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
