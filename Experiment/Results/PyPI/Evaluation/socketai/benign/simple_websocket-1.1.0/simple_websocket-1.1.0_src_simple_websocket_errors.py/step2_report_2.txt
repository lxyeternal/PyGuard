  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to WebSocket connections.\n   - It imports `CloseReason` from an external library (`wsproto.frame_protocol`) and uses it as a default value in one exception class.\n   - There are no data flows, input handling, or processing of untrusted data.\n   - No external data reads, writes, or network interactions are present.\n   - The exception classes only set attributes and generate messages; no complex logic or data manipulation occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, straightforward, and free of issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes, with no data processing or security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning of the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are zero for malware and security risk, indicating no threat.\n   - The code's purpose is purely exception class definitions, which are inherently safe.\n   - No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious activities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores; the current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - It imports an external class but does not execute any untrusted code or perform harmful operations.\n   - The exception classes could be used in malicious contexts, but their definitions alone are harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for WebSocket handling, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
