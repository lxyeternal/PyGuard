  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors and closures.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "fires": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with optional parameters for status code, reason, and message. It imports a class 'CloseReason' but does not use any dynamic or untrusted data sources or perform any network or file operations. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python exception class patterns. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple, standard implementation of custom WebSocket-related exceptions. There are no indicators of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
