  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors and closures.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets exception messages and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError. ConnectionError optionally accepts a status_code and constructs a message. ConnectionClosed accepts a reason from wsproto.frame_protocol.CloseReason and an optional message, constructing a descriptive exception message. There is no user input handling, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. No indication of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward, standard, and focused solely on exception handling for WebSocket events.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes related to WebSocket connection errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
