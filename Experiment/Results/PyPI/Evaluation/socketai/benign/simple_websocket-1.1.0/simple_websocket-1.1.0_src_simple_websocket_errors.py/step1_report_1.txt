  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak or effect untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets attributes in exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class for WebSocket close reasons and defines three custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError. The constructors assign attributes related to connection status and reasons but do not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could be malicious. The exception classes are standard and do not contain hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent, no external data processing, and no suspicious activities.",
