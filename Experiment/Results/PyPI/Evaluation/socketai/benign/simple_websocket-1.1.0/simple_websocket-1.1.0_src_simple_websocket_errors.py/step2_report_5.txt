  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for WebSocket exception handling, with no external data processing, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior. The code imports a class (`CloseReason`) but does not process or manipulate it beyond assigning it to an attribute.  \n   **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. They do not identify any logical flaws or security concerns.  \n   **Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - purpose: Correctly describes the code's intent.\n   - sources, sinks, flows: No data flow or external input, which is correct.\n   - anomalies: None detected.\n   - analysis: Consistent, emphasizing the benign nature.\n   - conclusion: No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n   The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external data handling, no network operations, and no embedded secrets, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent. They correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payload present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard implementation of WebSocket exception classes with no security concerns.**",
