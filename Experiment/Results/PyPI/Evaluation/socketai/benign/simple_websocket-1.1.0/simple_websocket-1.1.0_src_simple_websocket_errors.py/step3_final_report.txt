{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors, providing structured error handling without processing untrusted data or performing network operations.",
  "sources": "Import of 'CloseReason' from 'wsproto.frame_protocol' used as a default value in an exception class; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the classes only store attributes and generate messages without data manipulation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for WebSocket-related exceptions, importing a class for setting default reasons. It does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of WebSocket exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
