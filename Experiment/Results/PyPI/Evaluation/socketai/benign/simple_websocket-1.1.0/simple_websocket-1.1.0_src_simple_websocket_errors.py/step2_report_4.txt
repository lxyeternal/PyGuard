  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Issue Presence:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes related to WebSocket connection errors.\n   - It imports `CloseReason` from `wsproto.frame_protocol`.\n   - The classes only set attributes and generate messages; no data processing, network operations, or external input handling occurs.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and has no security implications is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n   - `obfuscated: 0` is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - `securityRisk: 0` is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the code.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and does not contain hidden behaviors.\n\n5. **Consistency and Appropriateness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for WebSocket handling.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n  - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
