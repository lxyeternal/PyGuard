{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the simple_websocket server, focusing on connection handling, message processing, protocol negotiation, and various edge cases, using mock socket objects and websocket message events.",
  "sources": "Mock socket objects and websocket message event generators within the test environment, including environment variables and mock socket recv/send calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to mock socket.send and recv methods, and internal websocket event processing; no external data or secrets are involved.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from mocked socket.recv() to websocket event handlers, and responses are sent via mock socket.send(); all within a controlled test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of mocks is standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests designed to verify websocket server functionality. It employs standard mocking techniques, with no external network activity or sensitive data. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The test suite is well-structured, covering various scenarios without introducing any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a websocket server, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
