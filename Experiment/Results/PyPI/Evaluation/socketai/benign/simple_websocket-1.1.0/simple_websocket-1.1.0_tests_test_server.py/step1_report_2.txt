{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the simple_websocket server implementation, including connection handling, message exchange, and protocol negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include mock socket.recv() calls, mock events with WebSocket messages, environment variables, and mock connection objects.",
  "sinks": "Sending data through mock_socket.send() during tests, especially in methods like test_send, test_receive_ping, test_close, and mock_socket.send.assert_called_with().",
  "flows": "Data flows from mock socket.recv() or event inputs (such as Ping, TextMessage, BytesMessage) to server.receive() methods, and from server.send() to socket.send() outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code appears to be standard unit test code. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscated segments. No suspicious network activity or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the simple_websocket server, verifying various connection modes, message handling, protocol negotiation, and control frames. It uses mocks extensively for socket interactions and simulates different WebSocket scenarios. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors. The use of mock objects indicates testing rather than production or malicious code. No unusual code patterns, hidden backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code is well-structured, focusing solely on test logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a WebSocket server implementation, with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. Overall security risk is negligible, with high confidence in the benign nature of this code.",
