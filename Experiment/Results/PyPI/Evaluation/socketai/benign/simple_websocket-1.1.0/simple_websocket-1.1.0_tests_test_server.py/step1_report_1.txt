{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the simple_websocket server implementation, designed to verify websocket connection handling, message sending/receiving, and protocol negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include mock socket objects and environment variables; websocket messages like TextMessage, BytesMessage, Ping, Pong are generated as events.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through mock socket's send method; the code converts websocket messages to strings or bytes before sending.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket mocks flows through websocket event processing and is sent back via socket.send. Environment variables influence connection setup but are not malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No backdoors or suspicious behavior are evident. Use of mock objects is standard for tests; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of unit tests targeting the websocket server's functionality. It uses mock objects to simulate network I/O, and there are no operations involving external systems, secret retrieval, or data exfiltration. The tests cover message handling, connection lifecycle, protocol negotiation, and ping-pong keep-alives. No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. The code adheres to typical testing practices with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard test suite for a websocket server and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for verifying correct functionality without compromising security.",
