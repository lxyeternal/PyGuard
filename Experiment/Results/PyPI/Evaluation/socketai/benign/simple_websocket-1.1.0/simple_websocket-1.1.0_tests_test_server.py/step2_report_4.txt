  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Describes unit tests for websocket server, using mock socket objects and websocket message events. No suspicious data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are typical for test code—mock socket send/receive, no external or sensitive data involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious behavior. Use of mocks is standard for testing. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard testing code with high confidence in safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely test logic, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The score aligns well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to Report 1—unit tests with mock socket and websocket events.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data sent via socket.send() during tests; no external data or secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. All interactions are within the test environment.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard test suite, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or security issues. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Testing websocket behaviors, including connection acceptance, message receipt, protocol negotiation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through mock socket.recv() and socket.send(); no external or sensitive data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. All mock-based, with no malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical test suite, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Verifies websocket connection handling, messaging, protocol negotiation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mock socket send/recv; no external data or secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard testing code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to previous reports—unit tests with mock socket and websocket events.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows within controlled test environment; no external or sensitive data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. All mock-based.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard unit tests for a websocket server, using mocks to simulate network interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports' scores are consistent with their content and findings.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Justification:** The code is purely test logic, with no signs of sabotage, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities. The use of mocks and controlled inputs further reduces any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is very high, with negligible risk.",
