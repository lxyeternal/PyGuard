{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server interface for an ASGI application, handling connection acceptance, message receiving, sending, and closing.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming WebSocket messages via self._receive() and self._scope['subprotocols'].",
  "sinks": "Sends WebSocket messages via self._send() and raises exceptions on specific message types.",
  "flows": "Input from self._receive() flows into message handling, which then may trigger exceptions or sending responses through self._send().",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo: 'self.conncted' should be 'self.connected' in close() method; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard WebSocket handling patterns, with methods for accepting connections, receiving messages, sending data, and closing connections. It properly validates message types and manages connection states. The typo 'self.conncted' is a minor bug but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code relies on external functions and data (e.g., self._receive, self._send) but does not itself perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The only issue is a minor typo that could cause a bug but not a security concern.",
