  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the typo `self.conncted` in the `close()` method. This typo could cause logical bugs (e.g., the connection state not updating properly), but it does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - No other anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code, are detected across reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports consistently interpret the typo as a minor bug, which is accurate.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious network activity.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0.2, reflecting minor bugs but no security concerns.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n   - The minor typo bug does not warrant a higher score, and the absence of malicious activity supports this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware as 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They appropriately interpret the code as standard WebSocket handling logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified, reflecting the benign nature of the code with a minor bug.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor bug, no security impact)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The typo `self.conncted` should be corrected to `self.connected` to prevent logical bugs, but it does not affect security.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug. No malware or obfuscation is present, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
