  "purpose": "Implementation of a WebSocket ASGI handler for managing WebSocket connections, including accept, receive, send, and close operations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from the '_receive' callable; connection scope from 'scope' parameter; messages are received via '_receive'.",
  "sinks": "Outgoing WebSocket messages via '_send'; potential error handling via exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data from '_receive' flows through methods 'accept', 'receive', and 'close', with data sent via '_send'.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'self.conncted' (should be 'self.connected') in 'close' method; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a WebSocket server handler, managing connection acceptance, message receipt, message sending, and connection closure. It verifies message types and raises errors for unexpected message types. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data leaks, or suspicious network activity. The typo 'self.conncted' does not introduce security risks but indicates a potential bug. No malicious behavior or malicious payloads are present. The code structure and logic appear standard for WebSocket handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign WebSocket handler implementation with a minor typo bug. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks.",
