{
  "purpose": "Implementing a WebSocket server interface for ASGI applications, managing connection acceptance, message receiving, sending, and closing.",
  "sources": "Input from self._receive(), scope['subprotocols'], message dictionaries, data parameter in send().",
  "sinks": "Calls to self._send() with structured messages; potential for misuse if data is manipulated or if exceptions occur.",
  "flows": "Input from self._receive() -> Processing in receive() or _accept() -> Sending via self._send().",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error: 'self.conncted' instead of 'self.connected'. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages WebSocket connection lifecycle with methods for accepting, receiving, sending, and closing. It validates message types and handles subprotocol negotiation. A typo in 'self.conncted' suggests a bug but not malicious intent. No data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The structure is standard for WebSocket handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical WebSocket interface implementation with a minor bug (typo). No malicious behavior or security risks identified. The overall security risk is low.",
