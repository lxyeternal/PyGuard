{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server class for handling WebSocket connections asynchronously in an ASGI framework.",
  "sources": "Reads include scope, receive, send functions, and incoming WebSocket messages from the receive callable.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages via the send callable, raising exceptions on unexpected message types, and closing connections.",
  "flows": "Input from receive functions triggers state changes and message handling, with data sent via the send function to client or server.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'self.conncted' (should be 'self.connected'); no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous WebSocket handler class, managing connection acceptance, message receipt, sending, and closing. It raises exceptions for invalid message types and disconnects, which is typical behavior. There is a minor typo in 'self.conncted' which does not impact security but indicates a possible bug. No embedded malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions are present. The code appears to be a standard WebSocket management implementation without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of WebSocket handling with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The only issue is a typographical error that could affect functionality but not security.",
