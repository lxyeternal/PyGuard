  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug that impacts connection state management but does not pose security threats. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate; the malware score remains 0, and the security risk score could be slightly lowered but is acceptable at 0.2."
