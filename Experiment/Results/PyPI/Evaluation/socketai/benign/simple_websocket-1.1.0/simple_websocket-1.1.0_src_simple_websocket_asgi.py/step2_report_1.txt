  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present:** Typo 'self.conncted' in 'close' method. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Security implications:** The typo could cause the connection state to not update correctly, potentially leading to logical bugs, but not security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard WebSocket handler with a minor bug.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present:** Same typo ('self.conncted') noted.\n- **Security implications:** Same as above; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present:** Same typo.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious behavior, just a typo bug.\n- **Scores:** consistent with previous reports.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern, typical WebSocket handler.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present:** Same typo.\n- **Security implications:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present:** Same typo.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but justified by the typo bug which could cause functional bugs but not security risks.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The typo 'self.conncted' is a minor bug affecting connection state management but not security.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor bug, low security impact)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The existing scores are appropriate, and I agree with them.",
