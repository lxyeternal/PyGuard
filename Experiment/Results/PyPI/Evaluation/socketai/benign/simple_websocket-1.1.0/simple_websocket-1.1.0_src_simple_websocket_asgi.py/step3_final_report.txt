  "purpose": "Manage WebSocket connections in an ASGI environment, handling accept, receive, send, and close operations.",
  "sources": "Input from self._receive() for incoming messages; message data within 'websocket.connect', 'websocket.receive', 'websocket.disconnect' types.",
  "sinks": "Outgoing messages via self._send(), including 'websocket.accept', 'websocket.send', and 'websocket.close' types.",
  "flows": "Input received from self._receive() flows through accept, receive, and close methods; data sent via self._send() based on message type and data content.",
  "anomalies": "Typo 'self.conncted' in close() method, which may cause logical bugs but not security vulnerabilities; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket handler with methods for accepting connections, receiving messages, sending data, and closing connections. The only anomaly is a typo 'self.conncted' instead of 'self.connected' in the close() method, which could lead to incorrect connection state management but does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious external calls are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical WebSocket handling patterns. All reports correctly identify the typo and assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects a minor bug affecting functionality but not security. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug that impacts connection state management but does not pose security threats. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate; the malware score remains 0, and the security risk score could be slightly lowered but is acceptable at 0.2.",
