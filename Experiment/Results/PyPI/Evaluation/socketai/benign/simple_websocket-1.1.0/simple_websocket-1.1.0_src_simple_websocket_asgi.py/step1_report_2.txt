  "purpose": "Implement WebSocket server-side communication handling for an ASGI application.",
  "sources": "Data received via self._receive(), data sent via self._send(), class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "Self._send() calls with untrusted data, raising exceptions based on untrusted input, method calls that depend on external input.",
  "flows": "Input data from self._receive() flows to message processing, and then potentially to self._send() in send() and _accept() methods.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'self.conncted' (should be 'self.connected') which may cause logical issues. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a WebSocket handler class for ASGI applications. It accepts connections, handles message receiving and sending, and manages connection state. The flow of data is straightforward, from incoming receive calls to message processing and outgoing send calls. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or data leaks. The only issue is a typo in 'self.conncted' which affects the connection state management but is not malicious. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. Overall, the code appears to be a typical WebSocket handler with minor issues unrelated to security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket handler implementation with a minor typo. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected. The code functions as expected for managing WebSocket connections without malicious behavior.",
