  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a WebSocket ASGI handler class with methods for accept, receive, send, and close.\n- Contains a typo: `self.conncted` instead of `self.connected` in the `close()` method.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Standard logic for WebSocket management.\n- No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The typo `self.conncted` is present in all reports and the code.\n- This typo could cause logical bugs (e.g., the `if not self.connected:` check may not work as intended), but it does **not** introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- The typo is the only flaw identified across all reports.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0.\n- Obfuscated score = 0.\n- These are consistent with the code.\n\n### Security risk scores:\n- All reports assign a low security risk (~0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code.\n- The code is standard WebSocket handling code, with no evident security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Reasonableness of scores:\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n- The only notable issue is the typo, which affects functionality but not security.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unwarranted.\n- The code is benign, with only a minor bug.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor bug, no security concern)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Correct the typo `self.conncted` to `self.connected` to fix potential logical bugs.\n- No further security concerns are warranted based on this code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug that does not impact security. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the security risk score should remain low (~0.2). No supply chain or malicious activity is evident.",
