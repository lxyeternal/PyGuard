  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the same typo: `self.conncted` instead of `self.connected` in the `close()` method.\n- No reports mention any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious external calls.\n- All assessments conclude that the code is a standard WebSocket handler with no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating consistent observations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Issues:\n- **Presence of the typo:** Yes, all reports correctly identify the typo `self.conncted`. This is a bug but not a security issue.\n- **Malicious code or payloads:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None detected.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or external vulnerabilities:** None observed.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The typo in `self.conncted` affects connection state management but does not introduce security risks.\n- No other flaws or malicious logic are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 seems slightly high for such a benign code, but it may account for the typo bug, which could cause runtime issues. Still, it's not a security risk.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are identified, a **malware score of 0** is justified.\n- The **security risk score of 0.2** might be slightly conservative; the typo could cause bugs but not security issues. I would suggest lowering it to 0.1 or 0, but it's not unreasonable.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code's purpose is straightforward: handling WebSocket connections.\n- The typo could cause connection management bugs, but not security vulnerabilities.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified; the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (minor bug, not security-related)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard WebSocket handler with a minor typo bug. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1.\n\n**Recommendation:** Fix the typo to prevent runtime bugs, but from a security perspective, the code is benign.",
