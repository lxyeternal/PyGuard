  "purpose": "The code exports specific model classes for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local module '.models'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Importing model classes, then exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code patterns, no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from a local models module and defines the __all__ list for exports. It does not process any untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any malicious or suspicious constructs. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package modules. No security issues or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module definition for exporting classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
