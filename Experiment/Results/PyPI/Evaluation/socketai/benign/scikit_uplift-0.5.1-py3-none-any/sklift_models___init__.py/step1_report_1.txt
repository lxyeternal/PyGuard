{
  "purpose": "The code exports certain classes from a local module for external use, likely related to machine learning models and transformations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.models' to load classes: SoloModel, ClassTransformation, ClassTransformationReg, TwoModels.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Imports classes from the module; exports them via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears standard and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from a relative module named 'models' and defines the __all__ list for export. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. As it is only a module export statement, it lacks complexity and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic module export that appears standard and secure. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security concerns are detected.",
