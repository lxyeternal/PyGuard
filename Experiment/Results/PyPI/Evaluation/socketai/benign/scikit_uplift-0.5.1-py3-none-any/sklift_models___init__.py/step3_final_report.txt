  "purpose": "Import specific classes from a local module and expose them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .models module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only imports and exports classes",
  "flows": "Import from .models -> __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports four classes from a local module and exposes them via __all__, following standard Python module practices. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, high confidence, and no obfuscation or security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
