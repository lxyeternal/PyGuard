  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes from a module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.models).",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just module attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a local module named 'models' and defines __all__ for exports. It appears to be a standard module setup for organizing and exposing specific classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no external data handling or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module definition for exporting classes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
