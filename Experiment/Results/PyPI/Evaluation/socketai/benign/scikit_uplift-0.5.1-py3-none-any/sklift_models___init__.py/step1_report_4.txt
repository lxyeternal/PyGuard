{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific classes from a local models module and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .models, referencing local module classes",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or external data flow",
  "flows": "Imported classes are exported via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a relative module, which appears to be part of a package's internal structure. It defines __all__ for export control, a common Python practice. No data processing, input/output, or network operations are present. The code structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
