  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure dataset loader with integrity checks, no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 (reflecting standard hash verification routines). The scores are justified and appropriate."
