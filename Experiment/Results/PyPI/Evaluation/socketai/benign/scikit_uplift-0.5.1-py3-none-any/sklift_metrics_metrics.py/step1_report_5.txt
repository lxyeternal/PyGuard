{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for uplift modeling, including scoring, curve computation, evaluation metrics, and profit maximization, primarily for customer targeting and churn prediction scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as y_true, uplift, treatment, and dataframes; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly read during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any network operations, file writing, or system command executions. No sensitive data is leaked or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through statistical calculations, array manipulations, and data frame operations within functions; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. Usage of third-party libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn) is standard and safe. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of mathematical and statistical functions for uplift modeling, including curve calculations, scoring, and profit maximization. It uses standard libraries with no signs of malicious intent. No external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions focus solely on data processing and metrics calculation relevant to uplift modeling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of uplift modeling techniques, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely performs data analysis and metric computations without external data or system interactions.",
