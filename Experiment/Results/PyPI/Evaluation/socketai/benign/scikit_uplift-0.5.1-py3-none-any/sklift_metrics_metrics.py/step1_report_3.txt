{
  "purpose": "The code implements various functions for uplift modeling, including scoring, curve plotting, and profit maximization in marketing campaigns. It is designed to evaluate and optimize treatment effects in binary classification scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters such as y_true, uplift, treatment, and DataFrame inputs, which are all provided by the user or calling process.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system manipulation, or external communications are present. The functions operate purely on input data without network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions performing calculations and generating curves or scores, but no flow leads to external systems or data exfiltration. Data transformations are confined within the function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code utilizes standard numpy, pandas, and sklearn functions. No dynamic code execution or external network access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of uplift modeling metrics and profit calculations, relying on standard libraries. It performs data validation, numerical computations, and plotting preparations. All operations are typical for such statistical modeling tasks. No signs of malicious intent, hidden code, or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of uplift modeling techniques, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely processes input data to produce modeling metrics and profit analysis. The code is not obfuscated, and no external communications or harmful system manipulations are present.",
