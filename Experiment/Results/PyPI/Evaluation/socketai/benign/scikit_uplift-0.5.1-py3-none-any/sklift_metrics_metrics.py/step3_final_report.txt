{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for uplift modeling evaluation, including curve plotting, scoring, and profit maximization, primarily for marketing analytics and treatment effect estimation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters such as y_true, uplift, treatment, and DataFrame inputs; no external data sources or system calls are used.",
  "sinks": "All data processing occurs within memory; no network, file I/O, or system commands are present that could leak data or be malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal, from input parameters through calculations to output results; no external sinks or untrusted data outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate statistical and modeling calculations for uplift metrics, curves, and profit analysis. It includes input validation and uses common scientific libraries. No external system interactions or malicious constructs are present. The functions serve standard purposes in uplift modeling and campaign optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of uplift evaluation and profit functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates solely on input data, with no external communication or obfuscated code. The malware score is set appropriately at 0, and the security risk is negligible.",
