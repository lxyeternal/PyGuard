{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for uplift modeling, scoring, curve analysis, and profit maximization in a machine learning context related to treatment effects and campaign optimization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as y_true, uplift, treatment, and other data passed to functions; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as data exfiltration, network transmission, or system modification; no code writes to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations and function calls to output metrics, curves, and profit analysis; no external or untrusted data injection points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation present. Code uses standard numerical and pandas operations; no unusual code constructs or dynamic execution observed. No indications of data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements uplift modeling metrics, plotting curves, and profit calculations with standard numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn functions. It checks input types and lengths, uses typical mathematical and statistical operations, and does not contain network access, file manipulations, or obfuscated logic. The functions appear to perform legitimate analytic calculations related to treatment effects and campaign profitability. No hardcoded secrets, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior detected. The structure and dependencies are consistent with open-source analytic code for uplift modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, open-source module for uplift modeling and profit analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard calculations and plotting relevant to marketing analytics and treatment effect estimation. The code is well-structured and free of suspicious patterns.",
