{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions related to uplift modeling and defines an export list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.metrics'. No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process untrusted data or write data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed. The code is straightforward and typical for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from a local module named '.metrics' and explicitly defines what symbols to export via '__all__'. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. No dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no malicious logic are present. The code's intent seems to be organizing and exposing functions related to uplift metrics.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initializer that imports specific functions and exposes them. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code serves a typical purpose in a Python package, with no security concerns.",
