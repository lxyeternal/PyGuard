{
  "purpose": "The code imports various functions related to uplift modeling and metrics from a local module and defines the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.metrics'. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being written or transmitted to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions from a local module and sets the __all__ attribute. It does not execute any untrusted code, perform network communication, or handle user input. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export setup with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger package providing uplift metric functions, with no evident security risks.",
