{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting specific functions from a local metrics module, likely for use in a larger application or package related to uplift modeling and evaluation metrics.",
  "sources": "The source is a relative import from the current package's metrics module, which is reading the functions defined therein.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not contain any data sinks or untrusted data output; it only defines what symbols are exported.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports functions and does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The import and export statements are standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of functions related to uplift and response metrics from a local module named 'metrics'. It then explicitly defines '__all__' to specify exported symbols for module importation. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond static import/export. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module re-export pattern, commonly used for organizing package API. It poses no security risks or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
