{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions related to uplift modeling metrics and exposes them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.metrics' which presumably contains the function definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward module export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from a local module named '.metrics' and then explicitly declares these functions in __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard module re-export pattern with clear intent and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python module file for re-exporting functions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. It appears safe.",
