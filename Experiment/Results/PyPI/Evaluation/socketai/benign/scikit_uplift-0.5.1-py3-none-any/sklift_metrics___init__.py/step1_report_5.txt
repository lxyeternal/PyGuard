{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions related to uplift modeling and metrics from a local module and exposes them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module named '.metrics'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data or input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing functions in '.metrics' to exposing them via __all__ for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific functions from a local module and defines an export list. There is no dynamic code, external data input, or network activity. It does not include any obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data leaks. The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python module that re-exports functions from a local metrics module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
