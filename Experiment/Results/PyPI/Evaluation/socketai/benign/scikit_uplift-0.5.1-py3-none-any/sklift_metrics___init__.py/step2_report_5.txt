  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports multiple functions from a local module `.metrics`.\n- It then defines `__all__` to specify the public API of the module.\n- The code is purely static, with no dynamic execution, input/output, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears correct and standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar setup. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risks:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0 and no security risks.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- **Scores given:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n- **Risk scores:** Since the code is just import/export statements with no dynamic or external activity, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n- **Malware considerations:** No malicious activity is suggested or implied. The code does not execute or handle untrusted data.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- **Any inconsistencies:** No inconsistencies are present; all reports align.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports. The code is a straightforward import/export setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the provided code and reports.",
