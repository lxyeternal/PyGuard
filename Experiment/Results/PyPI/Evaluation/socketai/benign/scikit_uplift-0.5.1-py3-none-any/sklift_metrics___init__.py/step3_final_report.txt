{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API exposure file, importing specific functions from a local '.metrics' module and defining '__all__' to specify the public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from the '.metrics' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is from static import statements to the '__all__' declaration, with no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing functions and defining '__all__' for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
