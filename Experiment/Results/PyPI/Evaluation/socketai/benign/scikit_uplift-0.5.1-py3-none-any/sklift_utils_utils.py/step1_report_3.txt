{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to check if a given array contains only binary values (0 and 1).",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'array' parameter, which is an array-like object provided during function invocation.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a ValueError if the input array is not binary; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input array is checked for unique values; if non-binary, an exception is raised. There are no further data flows or untrusted data handling beyond this validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs a straightforward validation without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, which is a common numerical library. The function 'check_is_binary' checks whether the array contains only 0s and 1s, considering both int and float types. It does so by extracting unique values and comparing them to an array of [0, 1]. If the unique values differ, it raises a ValueError with an informative message. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious code. The code appears standard and safe, focused solely on input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple validation to ensure an array contains only binary values. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It is a standard utility function for input validation with no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
