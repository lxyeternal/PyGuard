  "purpose": "The function checks if an input array contains only binary values 0 and 1, either as integers or floats.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'array', which is a 1D array-like object, and the call to np.unique(array).",
  "sinks": "The ValueError raised if the array contains values other than 0 and 1.",
  "flows": "Input array -> np.unique(array) -> np.all() check -> potential exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The function performs a straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function to validate if an array contains only binary values (0 or 1), and raises an exception if not. The logic is simple and clear, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The check uses np.unique to identify all unique values and compares them to [0, 1], raising an error if they differ. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function intended for data validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
