  "purpose": "Function to check if an input array contains only binary values 0 and 1 (including float and int types).",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'array' provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The np.unique() function call and the ValueError raise; these handle array analysis and error reporting.",
  "flows": "The input array is processed by np.unique() to determine its unique values. If values are not binary, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward binary array validation with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function to verify if an array contains only 0 and 1, including their float equivalents. It uses np.unique() to find unique elements and checks if they exactly match [0, 1]. If not, it raises a ValueError with detailed message. The implementation is simple, safe, and standard for data validation without any suspicious code, malicious actions, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard array validation function with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It solely verifies binary values and raises an error if the input doesn't meet criteria. No security risks or malicious behavior detected.",
