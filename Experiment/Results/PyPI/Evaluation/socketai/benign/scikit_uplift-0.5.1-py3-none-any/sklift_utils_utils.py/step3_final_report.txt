  "purpose": "Validate whether the input array contains only binary values 0 and 1, including float equivalents.",
  "sources": "Input array passed to check_is_binary function; np.unique() used to identify unique elements.",
  "sinks": "Raising ValueError if validation fails; no other data sinks or external communications involved.",
  "flows": "np.unique(array) extracts unique values; comparison to [0, 1]; exception raised if not matching.",
  "anomalies": "Comparison `np.all(np.unique(array) == np.array([0, 1]))` is potentially flawed because it performs element-wise comparison, which may not correctly verify if unique values are exactly [0, 1]. For float inputs like 0.0 and 1.0, the comparison may fail due to type mismatch, leading to false negatives.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple validation to check if an array contains only binary values 0 and 1. It uses np.unique() to find unique elements and compares the result to [0, 1]. However, the comparison `np.all(np.unique(array) == np.array([0, 1]))` is not robust because it performs element-wise comparison, which can produce incorrect results if the unique array is [0.0, 1.0] (float types) or if the array contains only 0s or only 1s. This logical flaw can cause valid binary arrays to be rejected, leading to false negatives. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, as it is a benign validation function. The main issue is correctness, not security. To fix this, the comparison should be replaced with `np.array_equal(np.unique(array), np.array([0, 1]))` to ensure proper validation across data types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward validation utility with a logical flaw in the comparison method that can cause false negatives when validating float representations of binary values. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate, but the comparison should be corrected for accurate validation.",
