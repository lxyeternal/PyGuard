  "purpose": "Function to verify if an input array contains only binary values 0 and 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'array' received from external callers.",
  "sinks": "np.unique() and np.all() functions that process 'array' and produce a ValueError if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Input 'array' flows into np.unique() to identify unique elements, then into np.all() to check if the unique set equals [0, 1], leading to a potential exception if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The function performs a straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validation function that checks whether the input array contains only binary values 0 and 1. It uses numpy functions to find unique elements and verify they match the expected binary set. The function raises an exception if the check fails, which is standard behavior. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears safe and standard for data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate data validation task without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified beyond normal input validation concerns.",
