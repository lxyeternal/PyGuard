  "purpose": "This code module re-exports specific functions from a local 'datasets' package, likely for easier import elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the relative module '.datasets'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "Imported functions are re-exported via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions from a relative module and explicitly exports them in __all__, facilitating controlled access. There are no visible data processing, user input handling, or network operations. The code appears to be a straightforward module re-export with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple re-export module for dataset-related functions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present. The code is benign and straightforward.",
