{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific data handling functions from a local datasets module and defines an explicit list of exported functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the relative module '.datasets' (get_data_dir, clear_data_dir, fetch_x5, fetch_lenta, fetch_criteo, fetch_hillstrom, fetch_megafon)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only imports functions and defines exports, with no data flow or execution beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module, indicating modular design for data fetching and management. The explicit '__all__' list controls namespace exports, which is a standard Python practice. No dynamic execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute user input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module that re-exports functions from a local datasets module for organized access. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation in this snippet.",
