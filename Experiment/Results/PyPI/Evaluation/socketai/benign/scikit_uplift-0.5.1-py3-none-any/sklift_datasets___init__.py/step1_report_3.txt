  "purpose": "To import and expose dataset-related functions for data handling and fetching operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local datasets module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are re-exported for external use; no data flow or processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard import/export conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module named 'datasets' and then makes these functions available for external modules by listing them in __all__. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data manipulation, or obfuscated code present. The functions' names suggest data fetching and directory management, typical in data pipeline setups. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or cryptic code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign code snippet intended for module exports, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
