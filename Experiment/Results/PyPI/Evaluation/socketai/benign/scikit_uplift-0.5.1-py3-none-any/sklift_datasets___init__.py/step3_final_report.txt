{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions from a local 'datasets' module and re-exports them via __all__ for external use, serving as a simple organizational pattern.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local '.datasets' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import from '.datasets' → re-export via __all__; no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module re-export pattern, importing functions related to data handling and exposing them for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions imported are typical for data pipelines, and the code does not perform any dynamic execution, external network communication, or contain hardcoded secrets. The simplicity and clarity of the code, along with the absence of suspicious patterns, justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a clean re-export module with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate a safe pattern, and the scores are consistent with this analysis.",
