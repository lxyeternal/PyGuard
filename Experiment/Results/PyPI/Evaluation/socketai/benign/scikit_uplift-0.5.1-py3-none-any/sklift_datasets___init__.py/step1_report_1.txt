  "purpose": "To re-export specific functions from the datasets module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local datasets module",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only re-exports functions without processing data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; standard re-export syntax",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a relative datasets module and then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. There is no processing, data flow, or external communication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is typical for organizing module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is standard, clean, and safe.",
