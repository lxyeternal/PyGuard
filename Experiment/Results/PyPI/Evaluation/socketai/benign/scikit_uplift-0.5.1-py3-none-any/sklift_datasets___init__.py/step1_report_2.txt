  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions from the local 'datasets' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local 'datasets' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; simply defining exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just re-exporting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module re-export with no embedded logic, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of functions from a local module and then explicitly defines an '__all__' list to control exports. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources. No hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of re-exporting functions for modularity or API clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
