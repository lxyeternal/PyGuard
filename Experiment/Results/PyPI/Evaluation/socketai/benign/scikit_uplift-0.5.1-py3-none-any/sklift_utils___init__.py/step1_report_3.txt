  "purpose": "Re-export the function 'check_is_binary' from the utils module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'check_is_binary' from a local module '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The imported function 'check_is_binary' is made available for external use; no data flow analysis is possible without further code.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears minimal and standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a single function and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The import is from a local module, which is common and not suspicious. No data processing or external communication is present. The minimal nature of the code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and typical for module re-exporting. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
