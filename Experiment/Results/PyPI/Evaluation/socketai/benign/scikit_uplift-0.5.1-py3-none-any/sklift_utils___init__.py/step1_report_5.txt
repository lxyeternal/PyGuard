  "purpose": "Re-exporting the 'check_is_binary' function from the utils module",
  "sources": "Import statement from local utils module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted input processing",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond module import and export",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is a common practice in Python modules for controlling public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No external network activity, environment variable misuse, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports a utility function without any malicious intent or security concerns. The code appears benign.",
