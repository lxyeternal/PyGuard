  "purpose": "The code imports a utility function 'check_is_binary' from a local module and exposes it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module './utils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing a function and defining the public API. There are no data inputs, external network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The imported function's behavior is not visible, but based on this snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a simple import and export statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
