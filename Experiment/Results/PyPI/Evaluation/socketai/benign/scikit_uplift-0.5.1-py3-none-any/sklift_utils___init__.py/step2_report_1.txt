  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .utils import check_is_binary\n\n__all__ = ['check_is_binary']\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **only** imports a function `check_is_binary` from a local module `.utils`.\n- It then exposes `check_is_binary` via the `__all__` list.\n- There are **no** data flows, external communications, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The code is minimal and standard for re-exporting a utility function.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data flows, untrusted input/output handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- All assign a confidence of 1.0 and a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate or understate any risks.\n- The assumption that importing and re-exporting a function is benign is correct here.\n- No claims are made about the behavior of `check_is_binary`, which is appropriate since its implementation isn't shown.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — No security issues apparent.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0.0, given the lack of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is a simple re-export of a utility function with no malicious or obfuscating elements. The scores are justified and should not be adjusted.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the provided reports.",
