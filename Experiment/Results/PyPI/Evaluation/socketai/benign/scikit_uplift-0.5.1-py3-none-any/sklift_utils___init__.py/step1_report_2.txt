{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'check_is_binary' from a local module 'utils' and exposes it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only performs an import and defines '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is simple and standard, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports a function from a local 'utils' module. There are no input, output, or data processing operations. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure and syntax are typical for Python modules, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a simple import and exposing a function via '__all__'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
