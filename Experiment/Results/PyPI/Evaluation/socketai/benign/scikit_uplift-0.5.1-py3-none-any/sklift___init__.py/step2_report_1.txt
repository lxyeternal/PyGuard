  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly conclude that this code snippet is harmless.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 in all cases, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - All reports correctly assign a risk score of 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and standard.** No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a simple version declaration with no security implications. The scores are appropriate and justified. The code poses no threat or security concern.",
