  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls. The code is minimal, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
