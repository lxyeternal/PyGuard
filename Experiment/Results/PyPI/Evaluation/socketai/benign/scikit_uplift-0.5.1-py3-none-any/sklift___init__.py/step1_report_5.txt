  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code, just a version string",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data reads, nor any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for open-source packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
