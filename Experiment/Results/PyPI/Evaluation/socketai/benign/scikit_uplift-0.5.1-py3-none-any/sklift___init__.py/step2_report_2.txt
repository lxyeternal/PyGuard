  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - They uniformly conclude that the code is safe, which aligns with the actual content.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n   - The code poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted security concerns are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the security risk as nonexistent.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate (for completeness):\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed review, confirming the code's benign nature.",
