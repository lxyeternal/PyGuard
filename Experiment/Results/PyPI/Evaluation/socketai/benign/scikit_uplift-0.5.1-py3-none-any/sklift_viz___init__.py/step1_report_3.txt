{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes related to plotting and displaying uplift curves and treatment balance in a data analysis or machine learning context, and defines what symbols are exported for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from a relative module '.base', likely a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily performs import and export definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static code references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs static import and symbol declaration operations, which are typical in Python modules for organizing namespace exports. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The import is relative, pointing to a local module, and __all__ explicitly exports functions and classes, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python module setup for exporting plotting functions and classes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
