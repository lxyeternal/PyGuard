  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from a local module named 'base' and defines the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .base import ... and the __all__ list definition",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external data flow are present",
  "flows": "The import statement is straightforward and only imports internal functions; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions and a class from a relative module and declares the public interface. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a typical Python module structure focused on plotting functions related to uplift and treatment analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
