  "purpose": "Define and export functions and classes related to uplift and treatment balance plotting for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .base that brings in plotting functions and a display class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external network or data leakage points; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code imports from a local module and then exposes specific functions/classes for external use; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific plotting functions and a class from a relative module '.base' and defines an '__all__' list to control exports. There are no input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data. There are no sinks like network operations, file writing, or system modifications. The code structure is standard for Python packages, aimed at organizing exports. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module for organizing and exposing functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for exporting specific functions and classes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
