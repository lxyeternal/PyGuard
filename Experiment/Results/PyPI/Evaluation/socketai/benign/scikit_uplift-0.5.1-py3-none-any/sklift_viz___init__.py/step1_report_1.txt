{
  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for a module, explicitly exporting certain functions and classes related to plotting uplift and treatment balance curves.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.base) that loads functions and classes related to plotting and display.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply imports and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an __all__ list declaration, both of which are standard Python constructs for module exports. There are no input operations, no data processing, and no external communications or file manipulations. The import is relative, suggesting this code is part of a larger package. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a simple aggregator or export point for plotting functions and a display class related to uplift analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
