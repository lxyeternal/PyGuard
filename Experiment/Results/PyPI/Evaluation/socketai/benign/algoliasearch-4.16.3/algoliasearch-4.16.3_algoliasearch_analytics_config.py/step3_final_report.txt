  "purpose": "This code initializes configuration parameters for connecting to an analytics service, including validation of credentials, region, and environment-based proxies, and constructs host URLs accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (app_id, api_key, region), environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY)",
  "sinks": "Headers containing credentials, host URL construction, environment variables for proxies",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables influence headers, host URL, and proxies used in network communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard validation and environment variable usage",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for app_id and api_key, reads proxy URLs from environment variables, validates region against a fixed list, and constructs host URLs dynamically. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. Proxy environment variables are standard but could be manipulated externally; however, this is common practice. The headers include credentials and user-agent, which are typical for API clients. Overall, the code is a straightforward configuration class with proper validation and environment handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration class for an SDK or API client, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
