  "purpose": "Define a data model for responses containing top search analytics with revenue metrics, serialized/deserialized via JSON.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (json, sys), external models (TopSearchWithRevenueAnalytics), environment variables, and JSON input for serialization/deserialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that process or output data: to_json, from_json, to_dict, from_dict; these could expose data if combined with untrusted input or output channels.",
  "flows": "Input JSON (via from_json or from_dict) -> data validation and model instantiation -> serialization via to_json or to_dict.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows detected. Use of dynamic alias generation is benign. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic data model with serialization and deserialization methods. It uses standard Python features, environment info, and external models. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. Methods correctly handle None and type validation. No hardcoded credentials or external network activity. The alias generator and model configuration are standard. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition for API response handling with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
