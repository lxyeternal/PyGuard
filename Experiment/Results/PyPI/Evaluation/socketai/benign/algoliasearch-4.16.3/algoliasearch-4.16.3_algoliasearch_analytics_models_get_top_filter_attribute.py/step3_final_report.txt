  "purpose": "Defines a data model for filter attribute info with JSON serialization/deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input data from JSON strings via loads() and dicts via model_validate().",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows or untrusted sinks present.",
  "flows": "JSON input -> loads() -> model_validate() -> model instance -> to_json()/to_dict() -> JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic data model with methods for JSON serialization/deserialization. It uses standard libraries, conditional imports for compatibility, and an alias generator. No external network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present. The aliasing and configuration are typical for such models. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The security implications are minimal; the code simply handles data validation and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues. It functions as a typical API data model with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
