  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is purely metadata—comments and a static version string—with no executable logic, input handling, network calls, or data processing. There are no signs of embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. The code is standard boilerplate generated by OpenAPI Generator.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or security risks. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. Since the code is just static comments and a version string, these scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all assessments agree that the code is harmless, the risk scores should remain at 0. No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign boilerplate metadata.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. Given the minimal and safe content, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, this code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.** It is simply a metadata header for a generated SDK component.\n\n**Conclusion**: No changes needed. The code is safe.",
