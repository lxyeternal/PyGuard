  "purpose": "Metadata header indicating code generation and version info for an SDK component.",
  "sources": "Static comments and version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is boilerplate generated by OpenAPI Generator",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, input handling, or network operations. It is a static, metadata-only snippet typical of auto-generated SDK code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data, connect to external systems, or contain any security-sensitive operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely informational metadata with no security concerns. It is safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
