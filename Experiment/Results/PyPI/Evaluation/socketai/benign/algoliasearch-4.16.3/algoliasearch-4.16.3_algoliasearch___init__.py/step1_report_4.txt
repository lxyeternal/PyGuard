{
  "purpose": "Metadata and header comments indicating generated code and package version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for version info and comments from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process input or execute data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of generated code disclaimer, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version string variable assignment. There is no executable logic, input handling, or data transmission. The comments specify that the code is generated and should not be manually edited, which is standard for auto-generated SDK files. The version string is static and does not contain sensitive information or executable code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign header and metadata fragment typical for generated SDK code. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and does not warrant concern.",
