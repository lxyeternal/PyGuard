{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for daily revenue reporting with JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON strings in from_json; reads dictionaries in from_dict; reads environment info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; data is processed internally without unsafe operations or external output.",
  "flows": "from_json -> loads -> from_dict -> model_validate; from_dict -> CurrencyCode.from_dict",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, no unusual or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data model using pydantic for validation. It includes methods for JSON serialization and deserialization, and conditional import for type annotations. CurrencyCode objects are constructed from dictionaries, but no external network or file operations are performed. No hidden code or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation for data handling.",
