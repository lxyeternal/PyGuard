  "purpose": "Define a data model for daily revenue with currency breakdown, serialization, and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON input in from_json and from_dict methods, and environment or external data when creating CurrencyCode objects.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON via to_json and to_dict methods; potential for untrusted data processing if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input JSON -> from_json / from_dict -> model_validate / CurrencyCode.from_dict -> model_dump_json / model_dump -> output JSON",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic features is limited to standard serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pydantic data model for serializing/deserializing structured data related to daily revenue. It processes input JSON into model instances and exports data back to JSON or dicts. No external input is directly executed or evaluated as code. No suspicious external network calls, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The only notable aspect is the use of model validation and alias generation, which are typical for such data models. The CurrencyCode.from_dict method could potentially be examined further, but based on this code, it appears as a straightforward data conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard data model with serialization/deserialization logic. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The implementation appears safe and aligned with common practices for data handling.",
