  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic data model for representing daily search query data with serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON input strings in from_json method, input dictionaries in from_dict method, and class attributes during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON strings via to_json, dictionary representations via to_dict, and class instances.",
  "flows": "Input JSON/string -> loads -> from_json -> model_validate -> class instance; class instance -> to_json or to_dict -> JSON string/dict output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard data modeling with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model with standard methods for serialization/deserialization. It includes conditional import for compatibility, a simple aliasing function, and configuration for the model. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No malicious or suspicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for data serialization/deserialization and does not contain any malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements.",
