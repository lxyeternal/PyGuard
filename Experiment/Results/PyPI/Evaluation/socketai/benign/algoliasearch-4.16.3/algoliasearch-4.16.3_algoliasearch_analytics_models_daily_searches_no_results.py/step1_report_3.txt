  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for representing daily search statistics, including serialization/deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Constants (_ALIASES), imported modules (json.loads, sys.version_info, typing, pydantic), class attributes and methods, and functions within the class.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization/deserialization (json.dumps, json.loads), class methods for creating instances from JSON or dicts.",
  "flows": "Input JSON string -> from_json -> loads -> from_dict -> model_validate -> class instance -> to_json / to_dict -> JSON output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL, or network activity; use of dynamic alias generator is standard, no obfuscated code; model validation appears straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model using Pydantic for serializing and deserializing search statistics data. It uses standard Python modules and a well-known library (pydantic). The alias generator maps attribute names to specific JSON keys. The methods facilitate JSON handling without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No suspicious imports, code, or logic are present. No malicious behavior or backdoors detected. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose for data modeling and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model with serialization/deserialization capabilities, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
