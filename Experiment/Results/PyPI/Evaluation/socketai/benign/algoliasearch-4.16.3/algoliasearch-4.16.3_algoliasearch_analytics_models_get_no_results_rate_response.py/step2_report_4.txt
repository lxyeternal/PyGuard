  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Pydantic data model, auto-generated, with standard serialization/deserialization methods.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and external models.\n- The functions and attributes serve typical data handling purposes.\n- No external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define a data model for no results rate responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; standard practice.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, handling API responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity; JSON loads is standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low), confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No issues; standard data model.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar data model.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Data model for no results rate.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity; potential concern about JSON input but standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2 (low), confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated data model with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to JSON handling potential risks, but overall safe)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
