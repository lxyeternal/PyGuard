{
  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for handling responses related to no results search rates, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "JSON input in from_json, from_dict methods; environment information from sys.version_info; imported modules such as loads from json.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if JSON contains sensitive information, but none is apparent; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "flows": "from_json/ from_dict methods load JSON data into model; to_json/ to_dict methods serialize data back to JSON/dict.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic alias generator for field names, but this is standard for flexible field naming; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with serialization/deserialization capabilities for handling API responses related to no-results search rates. It uses standard Python libraries and external models, with proper type annotations and configuration. No external system interactions, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed. The alias generator manages field name mappings. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Code appears standard, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured data model definition with no malicious intent. It serves to process API responses securely and efficiently. No security risks or malware signs detected.",
