{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for handling no results rate responses from an API, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "loads from json string in from_json; input parameters in methods; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted input or perform dangerous actions; data is processed within model validation methods.",
  "flows": "JSON string input -> loads -> from_dict -> model validation -> object instance; object -> to_json / to_dict -> serialized data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of external models is standard. No unsafe eval or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic data model with standard serialization/deserialization methods. It uses typical Python constructs and standard library functions for JSON handling. No suspicious logic, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The aliasing mechanism and model validation follow normal practices. The code appears to be a straightforward data container for API responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a data model for API responses with serialization support. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe and clean.",
