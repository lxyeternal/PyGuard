  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of static comments and a version string.\n- No input/output, data processing, network calls, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is typical for auto-generated SDK headers or metadata files.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable comments.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting the clear, consistent analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and conservative; given the code's simplicity, this is appropriate.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident.\n- Since the code is purely metadata, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The assessments are accurate and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The overall risk is negligible, and the code poses no security threat.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code snippet.",
