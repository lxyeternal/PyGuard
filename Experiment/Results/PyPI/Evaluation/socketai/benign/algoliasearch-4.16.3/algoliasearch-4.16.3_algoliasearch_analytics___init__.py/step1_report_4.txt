  "anomalies": "Presence of generated code comment and version string, but no suspicious or unusual code structures or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments and a version assignment statement. There are no data input sources, no data sinks, and no executable logic or external data flows. The comments indicate code was generated by an automated tool, with no manual modifications. The version string appears to be standard metadata. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are detectable from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata snippet containing no executable logic or suspicious elements. It appears to be a standard part of generated API client code with no security risks.",
