  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely static, consisting of comments and a version assignment.\n   - No functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code are present.\n   - The code is auto-generated metadata, typical for SDKs or API clients.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No suspicious constructs or anomalies are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n   - The analysis aligns with the evidence: static comments and version info only.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code snippet is benign, with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
