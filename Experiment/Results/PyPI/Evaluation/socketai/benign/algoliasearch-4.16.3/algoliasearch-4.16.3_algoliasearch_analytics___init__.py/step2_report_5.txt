  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**  \n   All reports conclude that the code is purely static metadata, generated comments, and version assignments with no dynamic or executable code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data handling.\n\n2. **Code Content and Structure:**  \n   The code snippets are minimal, consisting only of comments and a version string. No functions, data processing, network calls, or input/output operations are present.\n\n3. **Risk and Malware Scores:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. Similarly, the security risk is rated as zero, which is consistent with the static, metadata-only nature of the code.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and generated, with no suspicious or harmful elements. No assumptions are made beyond what is evident.\n\n5. **Scores Justification:**  \n   Given the static, metadata-only content, the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable. No changes are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   Since the code is auto-generated and contains only comments and a version string, there is no possibility of hidden malicious behavior. The reports are consistent and thorough.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are benign, static metadata, typical of auto-generated SDK headers. The reports are accurate and well-justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
