{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a generated header for an API client, providing package metadata and a warning against manual edits.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's docstring, version string, and a comment block",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is static and metadata only",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard generated comments and a version string, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a UTF-8 encoding declaration, a comment block generated by a tool, and a version assignment. No input handling, no data processing, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The presence of generated comments and version info is typical for auto-generated SDKs, posing no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated header with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only provides package metadata and warnings about manual edits.",
