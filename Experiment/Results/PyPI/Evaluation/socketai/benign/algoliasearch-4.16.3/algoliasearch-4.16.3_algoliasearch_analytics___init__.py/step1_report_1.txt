  "sources": "No input or data reading; the only source is static code and comments",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there is no dynamic or input-related code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block and a version assignment. The comment indicates that the code was auto-generated by OpenAPI Generator, with a warning against manual edits. The version string is a static attribute, indicating the package version. There are no functions, data handling, network calls, or dynamic execution. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, static metadata snippet with no malicious or suspicious content. It is standard for auto-generated SDKs and does not pose any security risks.",
