  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for daily click-through rates with serialization/deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; data fields are assigned from JSON inputs or dicts.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is used for sensitive operations, no network or file outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON/dict inputs to model validation, then to JSON/dict outputs, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of alias generator for field name mapping is normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard model serialization/deserialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and pydantic for data validation, defines a data model with fields and aliases, and provides methods for converting to/from JSON and dict. The alias generator maps specific field names to custom names, which is a common pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The class is purely data-centric, with no network or system modifications. The version compatibility handling is standard for supporting different Python versions. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a data model for tracking click-through rates. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
