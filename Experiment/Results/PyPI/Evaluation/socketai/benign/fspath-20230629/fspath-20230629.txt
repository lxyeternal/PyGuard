      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is ensuring the integrity of external files loaded dynamically. The scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk around 0.2. No modifications are necessary."

The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is justified by the potential exposure of system paths but is generally acceptable. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for packaging Python scripts into Windows executables. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern relates to reliance on unstable internal APIs and potential misuse for distributing malicious scripts, but the code itself is safe. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to API stability concerns rather than malicious intent."

The environment variable modifications are local and standard. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

It includes a debugging console that could be misused if exposed but is controlled via environment variables and debug flags. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
