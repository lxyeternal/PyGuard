{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility classes 'Options' and 'OptionsWithDefault' for managing options or configurations with default values.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply manages internal dictionaries and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code uses standard Python features such as property, __getattr__, __setattr__, and class inheritance. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The classes are straightforward utility containers for options with optional default values. They override __getattr__ and __setattr__ to allow attribute-like access to dictionary entries. The code includes descriptive docstrings and uses standard Python idioms. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no suspicious code constructs, or insecure practices. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing simple options containers without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code is safe for use.",
