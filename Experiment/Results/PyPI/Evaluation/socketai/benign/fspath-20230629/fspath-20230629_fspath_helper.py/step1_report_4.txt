  "purpose": "Define helper classes for handling options with optional default values.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), property and method calls (__getattr__, __setattr__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__, __setattr__) flows through internal dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; class definitions with standard behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Options and OptionsWithDefault, which are containers for storing options in a dictionary-like structure. The classes include methods to access and set attributes dynamically. The implementation appears to be standard, with no external inputs, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks is present. The use of properties and methods aligns with typical design patterns for such utility classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of option containers with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any external operations, data leaks, or harmful behaviors. The code appears benign and suitable for general use.",
