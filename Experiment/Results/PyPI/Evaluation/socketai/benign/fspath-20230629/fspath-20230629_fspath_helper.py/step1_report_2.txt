  "purpose": "Define customizable options containers with default handling for use in larger Python applications.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code defines classes for data storage and access.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ and __setattr__, which could be exploited if used improperly, but in this context, it appears benign. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The classes Options and OptionsWithDefault are simple containers for key-value pairs, supporting attribute-style access and default values. They do not perform any external operations, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious. The use of __getattr__ and __setattr__ is standard for such container classes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code includes descriptive comments and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as utility classes for managing options and defaults; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
