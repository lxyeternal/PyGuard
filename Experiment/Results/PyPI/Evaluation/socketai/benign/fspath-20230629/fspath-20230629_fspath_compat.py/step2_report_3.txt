  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Content of the Code:**\n   - The code provides a compatibility layer for the `indent()` function between Python 2 and Python 3.\n   - It uses the `six` library to check if the environment is Python 3 (`PY3`).\n   - If Python 3, it imports `textwrap.indent`.\n   - If Python 2, it defines a backport of `indent()`.\n\n2. **Code Validity and Security Aspects:**\n   - The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is present.\n   - The code is intended solely for compatibility, with no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Review of Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty responses with \"error\": \"Empty response\".\n   - No actual analysis, reasoning, or claims are provided in these reports.\n   - Without content, there's no basis to evaluate correctness, logic, or security concerns.\n\n4. **Implications:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, they do not contain any claims, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n   - The absence of content suggests either incomplete reports or a lack of issues identified.\n\n5. **Assessment of Scores and Risks:**\n   - Given the code's benign nature, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The risk score should be minimal, likely near zero, because there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code itself is safe, and the reports do not provide any evidence to the contrary.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's clarity and the lack of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
