  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code appears to be a compatibility layer for the `indent()` function across Python 2 and Python 3.\n   - It imports `PY3` from `six` to determine the Python version.\n   - For Python 3, it imports `textwrap.indent`.\n   - For Python 2, it defines a custom `indent()` function that prepends a prefix to lines based on an optional predicate.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident in this code.\n   - The code is straightforward and common for maintaining compatibility.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis**:\n   - All reports are empty responses with `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` and no raw response content.\n   - No specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are described.\n   - Since reports contain no data, there are no logical flaws, errors, or suspicious claims to evaluate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Given the absence of any detailed report content, the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores should logically be minimal or zero.\n   - The empty responses do not suggest any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code itself is standard compatibility code, not obfuscated or malicious.\n\n4. **Critical Assessment**:\n   - Without additional context or specific issues raised in the reports, there is no basis to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, which limits the assessment.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0 (the code is straightforward and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to the lack of information; could be slightly higher if considering potential misreporting, but given data, it remains low)\n\n**Summary**:\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The reports are empty, so no issues can be identified or scored higher.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If future reports contain detailed findings, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
