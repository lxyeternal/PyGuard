  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Content of the Original Code:**\n   - The code is a compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, specifically for the `indent()` function from `textwrap`.\n   - For Python 3, it imports `indent()` directly.\n   - For Python 2, it provides a backport implementation of `indent()`.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty responses (\"Empty response\"), providing no additional details, errors, or analysis.\n   - This makes it impossible to identify any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior from the reports.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - Without any detailed report content, there are no claims of vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n   - The code itself appears to be a standard compatibility shim, with no evident malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - The backport implementation of `indent()` is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there's no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code does not seem to be obfuscated or malicious.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports cannot be justified or challenged without further details.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Given the code's nature, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n   - The malware score should also be 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscation is not present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Due to the lack of detailed reports, no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities are evident.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (which are not provided) should be adjusted to reflect the absence of issues.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of supply chain security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The code is a standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent.",
