  "purpose": "Provides compatibility for the 'indent()' function across Python 2 and 3 environments.",
  "sources": "Imports 'PY3' from 'six' to determine Python version; in Python 3, imports 'textwrap.indent'; in Python 2, defines a custom 'indent()' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only manipulates strings locally for compatibility purposes.",
  "flows": "Checks Python version -> imports or defines 'indent()' -> 'indent()' prepends prefix to lines based on predicate.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for the 'indent()' function, using 'six' to detect Python version and providing a backport for Python 2. It does not execute external commands, access network, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The provided reports are empty, containing no analysis or claims, indicating no known issues. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not suggest any security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
