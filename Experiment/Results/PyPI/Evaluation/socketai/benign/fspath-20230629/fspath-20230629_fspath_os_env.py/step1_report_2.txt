{
  "purpose": "Provides a convenient wrapper around environment variables, allowing attribute-style access and modification of environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ in __dict__, __getattr__, and get() method.",
  "targets": "Environment variables being set or retrieved; no direct data sinks that lead to leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Access to environment variables via attribute access or method calls, with potential modifications via __setattr__.",
  "anomalies": "The class exposes environment variables as a dictionary and allows setting environment variables via attribute assignment, which is standard; no suspicious code behavior or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class OS_ENV that wraps os.environ, providing attribute-style access (__getattr__, __setattr__, and __dict__). It allows reading and setting environment variables. No data is sent over network, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions are present. The code primarily enhances usability for environment variable access. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment variable wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It provides convenient access to environment variables, with no evident malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior.",
