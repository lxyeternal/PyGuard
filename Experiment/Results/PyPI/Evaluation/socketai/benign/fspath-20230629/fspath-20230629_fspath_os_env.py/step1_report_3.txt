  "purpose": "To provide a convenient wrapper around environment variable access and modification.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ, especially through __getattr__ and get() methods.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables via __setattr__, which affects os.environ.",
  "flows": "Accessing environment variables through attribute access or get() method; setting environment variables through attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses dynamic attribute access (__getattr__, __setattr__) to interact with environment variables, which could be misused to modify environment in unintended ways, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class OS_ENV that provides dictionary-like access to environment variables. It overrides __getattr__ and __setattr__ to proxy to os.environ, allowing attribute-style get/set. The get() method safely retrieves environment variables with a default. No input sources appear untrusted; no suspicious data flows or malicious code are present. The code does not perform any external network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. It primarily simplifies environment variable access. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper for environment variables, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It offers convenient access but does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
