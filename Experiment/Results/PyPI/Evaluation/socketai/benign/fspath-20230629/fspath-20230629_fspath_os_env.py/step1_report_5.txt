  "purpose": "Provides a singleton wrapper around environment variables for easier access and modification.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via __dict__, __getattr__, and get methods.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables via __setattr__.",
  "flows": "Code accesses environment variables and can set new environment variables, with no external input or data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The class merely wraps standard environment variable access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class OS_ENV that simplifies access to environment variables. It overrides __getattr__ and __setattr__ to delegate to os.environ, allowing attribute-style access. The get method wraps os.environ.get. The implementation appears standard and benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No input/output flows indicate data leakage or malicious data exfiltration. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class to simplify environment variable access. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
