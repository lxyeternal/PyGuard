  "purpose": "Provide a convenient wrapper around environment variable access, allowing attribute-style access and modification.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via __getattr__, __dict__, and get() method.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables via __setattr__.",
  "flows": "Attribute access or assignment flows to os.environ, enabling reading or setting environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class OS_ENV that wraps os.environ, providing property and method access to environment variables. It allows dynamic attribute access and modification of environment variables, which is a common pattern for managing environment settings in scripts. The class does not contain any code injection, network communication, or malicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The implementation is straightforward and safe, primarily providing syntactic sugar over os.environ.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard wrapper for environment variable access, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
