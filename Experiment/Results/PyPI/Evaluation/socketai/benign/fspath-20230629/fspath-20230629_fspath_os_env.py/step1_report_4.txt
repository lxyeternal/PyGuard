  "purpose": "To provide a convenient wrapper around environment variables for easier access and modification.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, particularly through __getattr__, __setattr__, and get method.",
  "sinks": "Modification of environment variables via __setattr__, potentially affecting system or process behavior.",
  "flows": "Access or modification requests flow from attribute access (__getattr__, __setattr__) to os.environ, altering environment state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The class essentially acts as a transparent wrapper around environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class OS_ENV that inherits from dict but overrides attribute access methods to interface with os.environ. It allows for easy reading and setting of environment variables using attribute syntax. The __dict__ property is overridden to return os.environ, enabling dict-like and attribute-like access. No untrusted input sources are present, and the environment modification is a standard pattern for managing environment variables within a process. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe wrapper around environment variables with no malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates environment variable management but does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.",
