{
  "purpose": "Defines console-related functions for determining console dimensions and key mappings for different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform info (sys.platform), executes shell command 'stty size' to get terminal size, imports from 'ctypes' for Windows console info, reads data from 'os.popen()' output.",
  "sinks": "Executes shell command 'stty size' which could potentially be manipulated if an attacker controls environment or OS, but generally safe. No untrusted input processed or passed to dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Determines platform → fetches console size via subprocess or Windows API → sets key mappings. No flow from untrusted external input to sensitive functions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The key mappings are extensive but standard for console input handling. The code appears to be standard, platform-specific implementation for console handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides platform-specific functions to retrieve console dimensions and key mappings. It uses standard system calls and libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The use of 'os.popen()' is typical for terminal size retrieval, and the Windows API calls are standard for console info. No suspicious data flows or anomalies detected. The code is focused on console I/O management, with no external or untrusted data inputs that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of console dimension retrieval and key mapping, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
