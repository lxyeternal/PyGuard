{
  "purpose": "The code provides console-related utility functions and key code definitions for cross-platform terminal handling.",
  "sources": "Reads console size information via 'stty size' command on Linux/macOS and Windows API calls for Windows. Also reads environment variables and system platform information.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No untrusted data is being written or sent over network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Console size functions obtain data from system commands or API calls; key definitions are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.popen' for 'stty size' could be insecure if environment is compromised, but this is standard for terminal size detection. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines utility functions for detecting terminal dimensions across different platforms, utilizing system commands and API calls. The key mappings are static and define control characters for keyboard inputs. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is any data sent elsewhere. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present. Error handling is broad but typical for such utility functions. No malicious behaviors or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of console handling utilities with key code definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
