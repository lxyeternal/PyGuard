{
  "purpose": "This code provides console-related utilities for determining terminal size and defining key mappings for keyboard inputs across different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and executes shell commands ('stty size') via os.popen(). Uses platform-specific system calls to retrieve console buffer info.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'stty size' command; accesses Windows console buffer info through ctypes. No untrusted data input or output handling observed.",
  "flows": "Console size functions obtain terminal dimensions via shell commands or system API calls. Key mappings are statically defined within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The use of os.popen with fixed command 'stty size' is standard; no injection risks identified. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily gathers console size information across platforms using standard methods: shell command ('stty size') on Linux/macOS and Windows API calls on Windows. The key mappings are static constants defined within an Options object. No external input is processed that could introduce security issues. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears benign, serving utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for console handling and key mapping. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as intended for cross-platform console size detection and key code definitions.",
