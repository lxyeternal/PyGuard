{
  "purpose": "Provides cross-platform console size detection functions and static key code mappings for terminal interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, executes 'stty size' command on Unix-like systems, and uses Windows API calls via ctypes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; system commands and API calls are used for system info retrieval.",
  "flows": "Platform detection leads to calling either consoleDimensionsLinux() or consoleDimensionsWIN(), which retrieve terminal size; key mappings are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; use of 'os.popen' is standard for terminal size detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for terminal size detection and key mappings, employing standard system calls and libraries. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or contain any payloads. Exception handling is broad but typical. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate given its functionality and implementation.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
