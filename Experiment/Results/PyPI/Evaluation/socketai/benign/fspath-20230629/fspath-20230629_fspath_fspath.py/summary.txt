  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured filesystem utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious sabotage. The potential security concern lies in misuse via malicious inputs, but the code itself is safe. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and justified."
