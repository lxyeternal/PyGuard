  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for packaging Python scripts into Windows executables. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern relates to reliance on unstable internal APIs and potential misuse for distributing malicious scripts, but the code itself is safe. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to API stability concerns rather than malicious intent."
