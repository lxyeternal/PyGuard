{
  "purpose": "Provides an API for semantic path names and utilities related to file system paths, environment variables, command execution, and progress bars.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (__pkginfo__, fspath, cli, os_env, _which, progressbar). No external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code mainly imports and assigns module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata from __pkginfo__, then imports several modules related to filesystem paths, environment, command execution, CLI, and progress bars. It acts as an interface aggregator. No code execution of untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious operations is present. The code appears standard and non-malicious, serving a modular API structure.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical package interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use based on the provided code.",
