{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing metadata and submodules to set up the API surface for the package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from __pkginfo__, imports submodules such as fspath, cli, os_env, _which, progressbar.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and metadata assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py-like module that imports internal modules and sets metadata variables. It does not process user input, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup script with no security issues or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
