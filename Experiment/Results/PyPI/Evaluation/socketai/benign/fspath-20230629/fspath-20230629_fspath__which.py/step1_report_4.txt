{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line utility to locate executables in the system's PATH environment variable, similar to the Unix 'which' command, with support for Windows and POSIX systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'PATH' and 'PATHEXT', command line arguments 'cmd' and 'all', and user input via CLI.",
  "sinks": "Prints output to stdout, potentially exposing paths of executables; no direct data leakage, but outputs could reveal system structure.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine search paths; command line arguments specify search targets; found paths are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses standard Python modules and imports. No network or file system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a 'which' utility, searching for executable files in system PATH on Windows and POSIX systems. It processes command line arguments, searches directories for executables, and outputs matches. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a common utility, with no obfuscated or malicious segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a command-line utility to locate executables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code. It operates as intended for its purpose without any suspicious features.",
