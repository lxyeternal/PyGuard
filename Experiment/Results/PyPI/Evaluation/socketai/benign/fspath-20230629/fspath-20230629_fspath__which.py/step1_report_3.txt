{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line utility to locate executables in the system's PATH environment variable, similar to the Unix 'which' command.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH, PATHEXT), command line input (cmd arguments), and system platform info.",
  "sinks": "Prints to standard output, potentially exposing data if combined with malicious input, but no sensitive data handling or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input commands flow from CLI arguments through 'which' function, which resolves paths and outputs results to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a 'which'-like utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to locate executables in the system PATH, handling Windows and POSIX differences. It uses environment variables and system platform info. No network operations, no file manipulation beyond path resolution, and no dynamic code execution observed. The use of external modules 'fspath' and 'cli' is noted, but their use appears standard for path handling and CLI argument parsing. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard, benign utility to find executables in the system PATH. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
