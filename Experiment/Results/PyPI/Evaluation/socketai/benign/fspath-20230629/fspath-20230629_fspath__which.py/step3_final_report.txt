  "purpose": "A platform-aware utility to locate executables in system PATH, mimicking 'which'.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PATH, PATHEXT), command-line arguments, filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (print), environment variables, filesystem checks.",
  "flows": "Input command and flags -> path search functions -> output paths via print.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward path search logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform-specific path searches for given commands, using environment variables and filesystem checks. It outputs matching paths, which is typical for such utilities. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The environment variable handling and path operations are standard. The potential minor risk stems from exposing executable paths, but this is common for 'which'-like tools and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a 'which'-like utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is justified by the potential exposure of system paths but is generally acceptable. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
