  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a 'which'-like utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is justified by the potential exposure of system paths but is generally acceptable. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate."
