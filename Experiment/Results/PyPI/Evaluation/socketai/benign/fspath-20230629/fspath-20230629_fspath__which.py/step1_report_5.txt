{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line utility similar to the Unix 'which' command, designed to locate executables in the system's PATH environment variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables 'PATH' and 'PATHEXT', input command names via command-line arguments, and uses the 'sys' module for platform detection.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output the located file paths to the console; environment variables are read but not modified; no external network or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Input command names from command-line arguments flow into the 'which' function, which searches the system PATH based on platform, ultimately printing the found paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of 'fspath.FSPath' appears to be a standard way to handle filesystem paths; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to locate executable files in the system PATH, handling both Windows and POSIX systems. It reads environment variables securely, performs path searches without modifying system state, and outputs results via print statements. The code relies on external modules ('fspath', 'cli') but their use appears benign. No signs of malicious payload, code injection, or backdoors are observed. The overall design is straightforward and consistent with a legitimate utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical 'which'-like utility without evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any covert operations or data exfiltration. The implementation appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
