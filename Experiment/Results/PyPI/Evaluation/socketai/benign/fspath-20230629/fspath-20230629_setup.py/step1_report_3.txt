{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package by reading package metadata and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading package info from '__pkginfo__.py' via load_source; reading files such as README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; data flows are limited to reading trusted configuration files and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of load_source to load package info is standard for avoiding import-time dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata dynamically using load_source, which is common in setup scripts. It carefully avoids importing the main package during setup to prevent dependency issues. Reading files with specified encoding is standard. No code injects untrusted data or performs any network or system modification actions. The overall structure is typical for a setup script and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. It loads package metadata securely, reads necessary files, and configures the package installation without performing any harmful actions.",
