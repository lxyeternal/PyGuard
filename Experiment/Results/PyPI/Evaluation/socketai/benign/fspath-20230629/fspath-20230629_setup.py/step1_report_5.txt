{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, preparing package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads files for long description and loads package info from a specified source file (__pkginfo__.py).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data outputs or network connections present.",
  "flows": "File reading flows into package metadata setup; source loading flows into package info variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of dynamic source loading is controlled and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads package info from a separate Python source file to avoid dependency issues during setup. It reads files like README and other package data safely with io.open. No network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code structures. The dynamic import approach is common for package setup scripts. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The overall structure follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
