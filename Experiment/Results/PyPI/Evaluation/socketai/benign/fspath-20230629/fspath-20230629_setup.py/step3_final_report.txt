{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that dynamically loads package metadata from an external module (__pkginfo__.py) to avoid import-time dependencies, then invokes setuptools.setup() with this metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files such as README.rst, and dynamically loading __pkginfo__.py via load_source or importlib.util.spec_from_file_location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in critical operations; the script reads files and executes code from __pkginfo__.py, which could be a sink if the file is maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "File reads (README.rst, __pkginfo__.py) to variables; dynamic import of __pkginfo__.py executes code from an external source; data flows from files into variables used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic source loading (__pkginfo__.py) which executes external code; no obfuscation or secrets detected; standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, with dynamic loading of package info to avoid import issues. The only potential security concern is executing code from an external file (__pkginfo__.py), which could be malicious if compromised. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and commonly used in setup scripts. The security risk is minimal if the external files are trusted, but the execution of external code warrants caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external file dependency. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is ensuring the integrity of external files loaded dynamically. The scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk around 0.2. No modifications are necessary.",
