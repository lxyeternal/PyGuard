{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package using setuptools, load package metadata, and read files for package description.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from '__pkginfo__.py', reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing modules dynamically from source files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network operations, file writes, or system commands are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables (PKG) are loaded from a source file, then used in the setup() function to define package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of dynamic module loading with load_source could be suspicious if used improperly, but here it is used solely for importing package info. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup operations. It dynamically loads a module '__pkginfo__.py' to retrieve package metadata, avoiding immediate import of dependencies. The 'readFile' function reads the README file for long description. The setup() call uses the retrieved package info to configure package installation parameters. No untrusted input sources, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears standard and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely loads package info and performs no harmful operations.",
