  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI framework intended for development and debugging. It includes a debugging console that could be misused if exposed but is controlled via environment variables and debug flags. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
