  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code in the first report shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of 0.65 and an obfuscation score of 0.7. Other reports are benign with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a low security risk of 0.2. The overall assessment aligns with the features described, with the first report being suspicious but not definitively malicious."
