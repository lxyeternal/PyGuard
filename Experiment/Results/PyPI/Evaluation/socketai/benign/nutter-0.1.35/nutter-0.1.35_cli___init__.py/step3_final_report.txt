  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections where input is read, environment variables accessed, or data processed (e.g., eval/exec, hardcoded strings).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "From sources like eval/exec or hardcoded strings to sinks such as network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, complex control flow, or unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The presence of eval/exec and obfuscation justifies higher suspicion. Benign code lacks these features. The overall structure suggests that if obfuscation and eval/exec are confirmed, the code could be malicious; otherwise, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the first report shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of 0.65 and an obfuscation score of 0.7. Other reports are benign with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a low security risk of 0.2. The overall assessment aligns with the features described, with the first report being suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
