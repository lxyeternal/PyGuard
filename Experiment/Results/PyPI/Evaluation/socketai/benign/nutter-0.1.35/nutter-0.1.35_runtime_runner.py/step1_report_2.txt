  "purpose": "Helper class to execute tests in parallel using a scheduler.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (common.scheduler, common.testexecresults, common.testresult, runtime.nutterfixture), no direct input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses scheduler.get_scheduler() and sched.add_function(), results collection; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Class methods initialize, add tests, execute tests via scheduler, and collect results. Data flows from test fixtures to scheduler, then results are collected into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to perform straightforward test execution coordination.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, defines a class for running tests in parallel, with methods to add tests, execute them using a scheduler, and collect results. It uses standard patterns without executing untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. All operations seem typical for a test runner. No malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a parallel test runner, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility class for executing tests concurrently.",
