  "purpose": "Helper class to execute tests in parallel using an external scheduler.",
  "sources": "Import statements: common.scheduler, common.testexecresults, common.testresult, runtime.nutterfixture; class initialization; method parameters.",
  "sinks": "scheduler.get_scheduler, sched.add_function, sched.run_and_wait, and methods on TestResults and TestExecResults objects.",
  "flows": "Initialization of scheduler, adding test fixtures, executing scheduler functions, collecting and returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing parallel test execution with input validation and results collection. It interacts with external modules for scheduling and test results handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code appears standard and focused on test orchestration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs test management and parallel execution without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical test runner helper class with no suspicious or malicious components.",
