{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'nutter' Python library, including reading dependencies, versioning, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, calling 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' for version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data; setup parameters are static or derived from controlled functions.",
  "flows": "Version obtained from 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()', dependencies loaded from a file, setup parameters statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The only potentially dynamic aspect is version retrieval, which appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads a requirements file, reads a markdown README, retrieves version info via a function call, and configures setup parameters. The use of 'setuptools' and standard Python packaging practices indicates normal behavior. The 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' function is external, but its usage here does not suggest malicious intent without additional context. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected actions for package configuration, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
