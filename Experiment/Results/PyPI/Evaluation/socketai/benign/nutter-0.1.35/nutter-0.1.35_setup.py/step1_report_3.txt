{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nutter' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, loading requirements from 'requirements.txt', calling 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; setup script primarily configures package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads description files -> retrieves version from 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' -> passes dependencies and metadata for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' could potentially invoke external code during setup, but this is standard for version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading the README and requirements files, and setting up package metadata. The call to 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' is a function call to retrieve version info, which is typical. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data flows are evident. The code relies on external packages and files, but nothing appears malicious in their usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It reads external files and invokes a version function, both typical in setup scripts. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
