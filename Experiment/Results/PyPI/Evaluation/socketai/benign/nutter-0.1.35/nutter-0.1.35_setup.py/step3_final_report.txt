{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and calls 'nuttercli.get_cli_version()' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and invokes external version function; no malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open()' without context manager in 'parse_requirements' (minor style issue); 'get_cli_version()' external call could execute code but is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The only dynamic operation is retrieving version info via an external function, which is standard. Minor style concern with file handling without context managers does not impact security. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern. The only minor issue is the lack of context managers, which is a coding style point, not a security risk.",
