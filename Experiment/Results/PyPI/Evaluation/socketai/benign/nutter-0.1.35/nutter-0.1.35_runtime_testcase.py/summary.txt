  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test framework with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the dynamic invocation of functions, which could be exploited if untrusted functions are injected. However, in typical testing environments, this pattern is standard and not inherently risky. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1)."
