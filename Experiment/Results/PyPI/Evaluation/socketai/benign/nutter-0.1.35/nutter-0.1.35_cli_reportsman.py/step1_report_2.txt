  "purpose": "Manage report writers for test results, including setting providers, adding results, and writing reports.",
  "sources": "Imports from common.api as nutter_api, function get_report_writer, report_writers parameter, class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Calls to nutter_api.get_report_writer, provider.add_result, provider.write.",
  "flows": "Initialization of ReportWriterManager -> _set_providers uses nutter_api.get_report_writer -> add_result calls provider.add_result -> write calls provider.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; only standard logging and API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code manages report writers using a straightforward provider pattern. It dynamically retrieves report writer instances from an imported API module. All function calls and data handling appear typical for such a utility, with no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external API calls to 'nutter_api' for obtaining report writers, but without additional context, this appears legitimate. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data leaks, or code injections are present within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard report management utility with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It performs expected operations for report handling with safe coding practices.",
