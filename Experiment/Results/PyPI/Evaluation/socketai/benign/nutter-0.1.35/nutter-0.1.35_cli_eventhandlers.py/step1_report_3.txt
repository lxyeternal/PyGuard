{
  "purpose": "This code defines a console-based event handler that processes and displays various test-related events from an event queue, primarily for logging and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'event_queue' via 'event_queue.get()' and event_instance properties such as 'event', 'data', and nested attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout via 'print', and logs exceptions via 'logging.debug'. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations like network or file system writes.",
  "flows": "Event data from the queue is processed based on the event type, generating formatted strings that are printed to stdout; no further untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code performs standard event handling and logging tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a console event handler for test-related events, using a straightforward approach to retrieve events from a queue, process them based on their type, and output formatted logs. It handles exceptions gracefully and includes methods for various event types without any data manipulation that could lead to security issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows. The code does not interact with external systems or sensitive data directly, and the usage of third-party modules appears standard. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious functionalities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard event handling and logging module with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger testing framework for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
