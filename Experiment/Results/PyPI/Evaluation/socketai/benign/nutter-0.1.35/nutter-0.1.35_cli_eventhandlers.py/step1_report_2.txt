{
  "purpose": "This code implements a console event handler for processing and displaying events related to testing workflows, including listing, scheduling, executing, and reporting test statuses.",
  "sources": "The code reads event instances from an event queue, which are supplied externally; specifically, it calls event_queue.get() to receive data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings to standard output via print(), which could potentially display sensitive information if event.data contains such data. No other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources (event_queue.get()) -> processing in _get_and_handle -> formatting in _get_output/_get_event_output -> output via print() to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard logging and exception handling. No dynamic code execution or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code processes event objects fetched from an external queue, handling different event types by formatting output messages for console display. It maintains counters for tests filtered, scheduled, and executed. No security-sensitive data processing or external data transmissions are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with standard exception handling, and does not perform any unsafe operations or include any malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign console event handler intended for logging and displaying testing workflow events. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
