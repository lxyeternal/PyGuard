{
  "purpose": "This code defines a console-based event handler for processing and outputting various status events related to testing workflows, such as listing tests, scheduling, execution, and results.",
  "sources": "Event instances fetched from an event queue, specifically the event data contained within each event object.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (print statements) and logging functions that output event information. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Events are retrieved from the queue (source), processed to generate textual output, which is then printed to stdout or logged (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with typical event handling logic; no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. Minor typo in method name '_get_event_ouput' (should be '_get_event_output') but this does not affect security or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured event handler that processes different event types and outputs corresponding messages. It utilizes a queue to fetch events and handles them based on their type, updating internal counters and formatting output. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or security-sensitive operations such as handling credentials or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is the typo in '_get_event_ouput' which might cause a runtime error if method calls fail, but it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical event handler implementation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as an output module for test status events and does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks.",
