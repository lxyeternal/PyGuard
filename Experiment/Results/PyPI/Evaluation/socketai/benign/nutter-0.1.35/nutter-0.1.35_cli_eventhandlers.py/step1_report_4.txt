{
  "purpose": "The code defines a console event handler class that processes various types of status events from a queue and outputs formatted messages to the console. It appears to be part of a testing or scheduling system.",
  "sources": "Reads events from an event queue via event_queue.get().",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted event information to sys.stdout using print().",
  "flows": "Event data is retrieved from the queue and passed to formatting functions, then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard logging and exception handling is present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code handles various event types related to testing and scheduling. It retrieves events from a queue and processes them based on their type, outputting information to the console. No input data is sanitized or validated beyond basic handling; however, the event data is used solely for display purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, file manipulations, or code injection. The overall structure appears typical for a logging/monitoring component, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward event handler for logging status messages. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities. It appears benign and safe for deployment.",
