{
  "purpose": "The code defines a console event handler for processing and displaying events related to test execution, such as listing tests, scheduling, execution, and results.",
  "sources": "Event instances from the event_queue, specifically the event data and event type properties",
  "sinks": "Outputting to stdout via print() function",
  "flows": "Event data is retrieved from the queue, processed into formatted strings, and printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external network calls or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles events related to testing workflows. It retrieves events from a queue, processes them according to their type, and outputs formatted messages. It uses exception handling but only for logging exceptions during queue processing. No data leaks, input sanitization issues, or external network interactions are observed. The functions perform simple string formatting and event handling without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive information. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign event handler for test status reporting. It operates solely through console output and does not contain malicious or suspicious features. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
