  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing framework component with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data sources, which is acceptable if data sources are trusted. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are accurate and justified."
