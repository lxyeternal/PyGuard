  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a CLI wrapper for a testing framework, managing test execution, reporting, and validation.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- Environment variables are used for versioning and configuration, which is standard.\n- External modules are abstracted; their internal security cannot be assessed here, but nothing suspicious is indicated.\n- The code handles user input, logging, and report generation in a conventional manner.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1:\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning states no malicious activity is detected, and the code is a legitimate CLI interface. The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk is low, given the code's nature and absence of suspicious behavior.  \n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2:\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis confirms no malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, given standard handling of environment variables and inputs.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3:\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No malicious activity, standard practices.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4:\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning applies. No signs of malicious behavior, standard code structure.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5:\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious activity detected. The code is a typical CLI wrapper with no suspicious patterns.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score (all reports):** 0 — no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard Python, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with a CLI tool managing test execution, with no signs of security flaws or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal security risk, typical for CLI tools)\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate CLI wrapper for a testing framework, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
