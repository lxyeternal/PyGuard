  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of unit tests verifying LaTeX output from the PrettyTable library.\n- They emphasize that the code only reads from a trusted, static `helper_table` object.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No data sinks, network communication, or file I/O are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is solely to verify formatting correctness.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n- Confidence levels are high (1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is a straightforward test suite with no malicious or suspicious logic. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports consistently recognize the code as benign, with no overlooked issues.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature. The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the absence of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5; all are at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing on the static, controlled nature of the tests.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is purely a set of unit tests for formatting verification, involving no untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation.\n- The code does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The high confidence scores reflect a consensus that the code is safe.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security risk score:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis.",
