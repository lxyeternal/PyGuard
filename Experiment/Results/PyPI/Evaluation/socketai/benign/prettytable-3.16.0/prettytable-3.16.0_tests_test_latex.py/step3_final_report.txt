  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying LaTeX output formatting of the PrettyTable library, ensuring correct string generation under various styles and options.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the helper_table object, calling get_latex_string() with different parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external data inputs, or outputs; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The code calls get_latex_string() on a trusted PrettyTable object with controlled parameters, and compares the output to expected LaTeX strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that verifies LaTeX string outputs from PrettyTable. It only interacts with a static, trusted object and performs assertions. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The purpose is solely to ensure formatting correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. The high confidence score (1) reflects the clear, controlled nature of the code and the absence of any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign set of unit tests for LaTeX output formatting. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
