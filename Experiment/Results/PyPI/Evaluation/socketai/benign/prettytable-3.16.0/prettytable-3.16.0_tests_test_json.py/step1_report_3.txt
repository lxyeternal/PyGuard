{
  "purpose": "The code is for testing the JSON serialization and deserialization methods of the PrettyTable library, ensuring correct JSON output and reconstruction of table data.",
  "sources": "The code reads table data via helper_table.get_json_string() and from_json() functions, as well as input parameters for JSON formatting options.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs JSON strings, but no untrusted data is directly fed into security-critical sinks such as network or file writes within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Table data is serialized into JSON strings and then deserialized back into table objects, with no external input flow affecting sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions verifying JSON serialization/deserialization of PrettyTable objects. It uses the library's methods without any user input or external data processing that could lead to injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, primarily testing output correctness. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are performed. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for JSON serialization/deserialization functions of PrettyTable. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and safe.",
