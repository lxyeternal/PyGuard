{
  "purpose": "The code implements unit tests for the PrettyTable library's JSON serialization and deserialization features, verifying correct output and round-trip integrity.",
  "sources": "Internal static data within test functions, including hardcoded table data and options.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded table data to JSON serialization functions and back via from_json, with assertions verifying correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard unit tests operating on controlled, static data. It uses well-known library functions without external input or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data is hardcoded, and the functions tested are safe. The code's purpose is to verify JSON output correctness, with no external dependencies or untrusted data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing the JSON features of PrettyTable. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
