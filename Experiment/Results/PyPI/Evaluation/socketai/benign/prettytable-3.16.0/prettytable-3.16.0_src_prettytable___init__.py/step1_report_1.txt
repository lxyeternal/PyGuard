{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides table formatting and data import functions, primarily for rendering tables and reading data from various sources.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules ('._version', '.prettytable') and the code itself, which defines module attributes and a deprecated attribute warning function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access. The only notable function is '__getattr__', which triggers a deprecation warning.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve attribute access that calls '__getattr__', which triggers deprecation warnings; no other data flow paths to external systems are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a '__getattr__' method that only calls a deprecation warning function indicates a pattern for handling deprecated attributes, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and deprecation warnings. It imports various symbols from internal modules and exposes them via '__all__'. The '__getattr__' method is used for deprecation warnings, a common pattern. There are no external network calls, no code execution of untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code appears to be well-structured and conventional for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file with deprecation handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, serving to re-export symbols and warn about deprecated attributes.",
