{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports various functions, classes, and constants related to pretty table rendering and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules ('._version', '.prettytable') and attribute access within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the '__getattr__' function, which could execute code when deprecated attributes are accessed.",
  "flows": "Accessing any deprecated attribute triggers '__getattr__', which calls '_warn_deprecation' potentially executing side effects such as logging or warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of '__getattr__' to handle deprecated attributes and redirect to '_warn_deprecation' is standard for deprecation handling; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package exports and deprecation warnings. It imports various components and defines a dynamic attribute handler for deprecated names. The '_warn_deprecation' function likely issues a warning about deprecated attributes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for managing deprecations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical package module focused on exporting components and handling deprecated attributes via warnings. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
