  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious or suspicious behavior, code logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard package init, re-exporting symbols, handling deprecation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only the `__getattr__` function calls `_warn_deprecation`, which is expected for deprecation warnings.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical module initializer with deprecation handling. No external network, file, or environment interactions. The deprecation pattern is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Scores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is mainly about exports and deprecation warnings.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 seems high but justified if considering the deprecation warning mechanism as a potential vector for misuse, though unlikely.\n\n**Assessment:** The code itself is benign. The high risk score may be slightly overstated but not unreasonable given the pattern of dynamic attribute access. Still, since no malicious activity is observed, a lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) might be more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard package setup, deprecation handling.\n- No suspicious behavior or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on the `__getattr__` handling of deprecated attributes.\n- No malicious code or external data flow.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to dynamic attribute handling, but this is typical for deprecation warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, which is acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, with emphasis on deprecation handling.\n- No suspicious code or external interactions.\n- Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1), justified by the dynamic attribute access.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for package management and deprecation warnings.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are zero.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature. The one report suggesting 0.95 risk seems overstated, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05–0.1 (minimal, mainly due to dynamic attribute handling for deprecation warnings)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard package initialization module, handling exports and deprecation warnings. There are no signs of supply chain security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are mostly appropriate, with minor overestimations in some cases.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** The code is benign. The deprecation warning mechanism is common and not inherently risky. No further security concerns are identified.",
