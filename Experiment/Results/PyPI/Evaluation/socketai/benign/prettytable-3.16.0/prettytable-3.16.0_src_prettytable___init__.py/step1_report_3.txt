{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides table formatting and importing functions, with deprecation warnings for certain features.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and functions, including version info, prettytable components, and deprecated features.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are apparent; the code primarily handles imports and deprecation warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to trigger deprecation warnings dynamically is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module metadata, imports various components, and defines __all__ for public API. It includes a __getattr__ function that issues deprecation warnings for undefined attributes, likely for backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file modifications, or obfuscated code. The overall structure is typical for a Python package module with deprecated features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with deprecation handling, presenting no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
