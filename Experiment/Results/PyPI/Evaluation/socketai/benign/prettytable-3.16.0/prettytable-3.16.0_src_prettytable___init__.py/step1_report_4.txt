{
  "purpose": "The code primarily defines module imports, exports, and a deprecation warning mechanism for the PrettyTable package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module and package-specific functions and variables",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the __getattr__ function, which may trigger deprecation warnings dynamically",
  "flows": "Access to undefined attributes via __getattr__ triggers _warn_deprecation, which may handle the attribute name as input",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to handle deprecated attributes dynamically; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from a local package, defines the __all__ list for exports, and implements a __getattr__ method to handle deprecated attribute access by calling _warn_deprecation. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no suspicious data flows, and no code injection mechanisms. The __getattr__ function only calls a warning function without executing any other potentially malicious code. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a module interface with deprecation handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages exports and warnings, and does not perform any network or file operations that could be malicious.",
