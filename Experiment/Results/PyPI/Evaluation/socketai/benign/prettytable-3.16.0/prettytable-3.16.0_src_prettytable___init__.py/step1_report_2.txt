{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that re-exports certain functions and constants, providing an interface for working with table data and related utilities.",
  "sources": "The code imports from internal modules (. _version, .prettytable) and defines __all__ for exported symbols. No external input or untrusted data sources are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks or outputs in this code; no network, filesystem, or other untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily defines module-level symbols and a deprecated attribute warning function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The __getattr__ function defers to a deprecation warning, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a module initializer that imports various symbols, sets an __all__ list for exports, and defines a __getattr__ for deprecation warnings. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or perform any network/file operations. The structure and content are consistent with normal package code intended to manage exports and deprecations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for package management and deprecation handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or suspicious activities are detected.",
