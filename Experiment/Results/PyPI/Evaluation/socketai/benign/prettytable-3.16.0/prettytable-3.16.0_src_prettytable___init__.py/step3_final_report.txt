{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that manages symbol exports and handles deprecation warnings via __getattr__.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute access requests, particularly for deprecated attributes, triggering _warn_deprecation.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the call to _warn_deprecation during attribute access, which issues warnings but does not perform external data operations.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which calls _warn_deprecation, leading to warning issuance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py pattern for managing exports and deprecation warnings. It uses __getattr__ to intercept attribute access and issue warnings via _warn_deprecation. There are no network, file, or environment variable interactions. The pattern is common and not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.05-0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The use of __getattr__ for deprecation warnings is standard practice. The overall security risk is negligible.",
