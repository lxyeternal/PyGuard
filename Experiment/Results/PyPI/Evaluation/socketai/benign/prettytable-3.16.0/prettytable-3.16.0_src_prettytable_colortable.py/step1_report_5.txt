{
  "purpose": "Defines theming and styling for table display using ANSI escape codes, including color themes and customization options.",
  "sources": "Import of colorama (optional), class initializations, static methods, and theme attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present that handle untrusted data, no output or network operations involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly configuration and formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code is mainly for styling and UI presentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides styling utilities for terminal output, using ANSI escape codes. It includes optional import handling for 'colorama' (which is common for cross-platform terminal coloring). The use of static methods for formatting codes appears benign. No external input is processed, and no network or system modification is present. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or external data streams that could be exploited. Overall, the code is straightforward, focusing on visual styling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for theming and styling terminal output. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No security risks are identified within the scope of this code fragment.",
