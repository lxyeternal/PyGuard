  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages ANSI theming for tables; static themes; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is purely for styling and theming, with no data flow from untrusted sources or malicious intent. The high confidence and zero scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; defines themes, safe formatting; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is straightforward theming logic. The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up themes, no external input, no malicious activity, slight security risk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slight security risk (0.1) seems to stem from the fact that ANSI escape sequences could be misused if external data influenced theme parameters. However, in the provided code, parameters are hardcoded or default, with no external input. The reasoning is cautious but perhaps overestimating risk. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; themes, safe, no dynamic input, potential misuse if external data influences styling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe securityRisk score of 0.2 suggests a slightly higher concern about external influence. Since the code does not process untrusted data, this might be an overestimation unless future modifications allow external input. But given the current code, this is conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign styling utility, no malicious behavior, no external input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied; some reports assign 0, others 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about potential misuse if external data influences theme parameters.\n\n**Given the code as provided:**\n\n- No input handling or external data processing exists.\n- The code is static, with default themes and safe ANSI formatting.\n- No network, file, or untrusted data processing.\n\n**Therefore, the risk scores should be very low or zero.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric          | Reasoning                                                                                       | Suggested Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | No malicious code or behavior present.                                                          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                                 | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | No external input, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling. The minor concern about external influence is not applicable here. | 0               |\n\n**Note:** If future versions allow external input to influence themes, then the security risk might increase, but for this static code, the scores should be zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's static, benign nature and the analysis provided.",
