{
  "purpose": "Define theming and color formatting for table display using PrettyTable and colorama, including theme customization and color code formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from theme parameters and optional color code strings; no external input reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "The get_string() method outputs formatted string data, which could include ANSI escape sequences, but no untrusted external data is processed or written to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Theme configuration flows from class instantiation and property setting; formatted color codes are constructed via static method and assigned to internal variables for display; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or unexpected code execution paths observed. The code appears to be straightforward theming logic for console display.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up theming options for colored table display using ANSI escape codes, with options for different themes. It defines classes for themes and their application, with static method formatting for color codes. No external input is processed, and the output is controlled formatting, with no indication of malicious activity. There are no obfuscations, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a theming utility for console table display, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles ANSI color codes and theme management, and does not process untrusted data or perform network or system modifications.",
