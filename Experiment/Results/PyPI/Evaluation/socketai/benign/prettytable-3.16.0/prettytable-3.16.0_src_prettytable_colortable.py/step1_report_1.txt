{
  "purpose": "Defines theming and color styling for table display using PrettyTable, with support for multiple color themes.",
  "sources": "Imports colorama for terminal coloring, uses input parameters for theme configuration, and static theme definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no user input or untrusted data is processed or output directly related to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Color codes are formatted via Theme.format_code() and applied to table display elements; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. No dynamic execution, no suspicious variable names, and no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages ANSI color theming for table display using PrettyTable and colorama. It defines several static themes with specific color codes, applies these themes to table elements, and formats ANSI escape sequences. There is no input handling, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. All operations are static configuration and formatting logic, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The use of color codes and theme configuration appears purely for display purposes, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or other malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, non-malicious utility for theming console tables with ANSI colors. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
