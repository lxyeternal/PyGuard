  "purpose": "Defines theming and color formatting for table display using PrettyTable and colorama.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama, PrettyTable, and internal static data in class variables and methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data outputs or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily handles internal formatting and theming.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The format_code method handles ANSI sequences safely. No obfuscation or hidden behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for theming table displays, with methods to format ANSI escape sequences and set themes. All functions and methods perform straightforward string formatting and object property management. No user input, network operations, or file access is involved. The code is purely for UI styling and does not contain malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard theming utility for terminal table displays with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and benign.",
