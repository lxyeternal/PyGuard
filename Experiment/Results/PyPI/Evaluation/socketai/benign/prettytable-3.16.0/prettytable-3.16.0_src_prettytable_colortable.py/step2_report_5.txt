  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages ANSI theming for PrettyTable, with static themes and safe formatting.\n- **Assessment:** No input processing, network activity, or obfuscated code. The logic is straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe static theming.\n- **Assessment:** No external data or untrusted sources involved. The code is purely for display styling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines themes with static parameters; no external input processed.\n- **Assessment:** No untrusted data handling; the only potential concern is if theme parameters could be influenced externally, but in the code, they are hardcoded or set during instantiation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification for Risk 0.1:** Slightly higher risk score might be justified if theme parameters are externally supplied, but in this code, they are defaults or set at initialization. The risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score seems slightly high but still low; perhaps 0.05 would be more appropriate, but 0.1 isn't unreasonable given the potential for external influence if misused.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on ANSI styling with safe formatting, no untrusted data.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic input or external data; the code is static and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) may overstate the potential if someone injects malicious escape sequences into theme parameters, but in this code, defaults are safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility for styling, no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No external data handling; static configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores in reports 3 and 4 are slightly higher (0.1 and 0.2). Given the code's static nature and absence of external input, these could be lowered to 0, aligning with the overall benign assessment.\n- The malware scores are appropriate at 0.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; no assumptions about malicious intent are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign utility for console theming, with no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
