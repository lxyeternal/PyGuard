{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for theming console tables with ANSI escape codes, supporting multiple themes. It formats ANSI sequences, applies themes, and manages color styling for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Static theme parameters within class initializations, and ANSI escape sequence formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static string formatting and theme application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no dynamic or external data influence.",
  "analysis": "The code manages console styling themes via ANSI escape sequences, with themes defined as static parameters. It includes safe string formatting, no user input, network activity, or external data handling. The only potential concern is if theme parameters are externally influenced, but in the current implementation, they are hardcoded or set during class instantiation. There is no obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage. The scoring in the provided reports slightly overestimates security risk due to conservative assumptions about external influence, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, safe utility for console theming with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The security risk scores, while slightly elevated in some reports, should be adjusted to zero given the static nature of the code. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
