  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   - The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functions.  \n   - It primarily tests HTML output correctness, escaping behaviors, formatting options, and internal border handling.  \n   - No indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n   - The data used in tests is controlled and static, with no external input sources or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \n   - The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the test logic.  \n   - The tests seem well-structured, covering a wide range of scenarios, including escaping, formatting, and internal border options.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - The risk scores are also 0 or very low, aligning with the benign nature of the tests.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating that the analysis perceives the code as safe.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:  \n   - The code only calls functions that generate HTML strings based on known, controlled data.  \n   - No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data injection is present.  \n   - The escaping functions are used correctly, and no unescaped user input is involved.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims**:  \n   - The reports correctly assume that the code is only for testing purposes and does not contain hidden malicious logic.  \n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that are unfounded; the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.  \n   - No overestimation of risk or malware is observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \n- The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for the PrettyTable library's HTML output functions.  \n- It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-risking elements.  \n- The highest risk score should remain at 0, with malware score at 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain security issues or malicious intent.",
