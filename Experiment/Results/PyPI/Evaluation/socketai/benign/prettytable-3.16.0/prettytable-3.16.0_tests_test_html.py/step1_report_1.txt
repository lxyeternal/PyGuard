{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functions, verifying correct HTML output, escaping behavior, and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the PrettyTable objects, including field names, rows, and attributes such as title and HTML content.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external systems or perform data leakage; potential risks involve HTML string generation that could include unescaped data if misused outside testing context.",
  "flows": "Input data (field names, rows, attributes) flows into the PrettyTable methods, which generate HTML strings. These strings could be used externally, but the code itself only tests the output format.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is standard unit test code relying on the PrettyTable library's API. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the HTML output of the PrettyTable library, including handling of escaping, formatting, and internal border options. No untrusted input sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code primarily calls functions that produce HTML strings based on known data, and it performs assertions on the output. The code is structured and clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard test suite for PrettyTable's HTML export functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code only manipulates test data and verifies output correctness.",
