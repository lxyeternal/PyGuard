  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functions.\n- It tests various aspects: correct HTML output, escaping behavior, formatting, internal border options, and handling of special characters.\n- No signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The data used in tests is controlled and static, with no external inputs or network calls.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for testing the PrettyTable library's HTML functions.\n- They note the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the analysis.\n\n**3. Review of scores assigned to issues:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- The risk scores are also 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no security risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No issues justify a higher risk score since the code only performs controlled testing and output validation.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or security flaws.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as executing untrusted code, network operations, or data exfiltration.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- All assessments are cautious and based on the actual code behavior.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without supporting evidence.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature—test code with no malicious intent.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward test suite for the PrettyTable library, focusing solely on HTML output validation. It does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The tests are static, controlled, and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\nThis is a safe, benign test code with no supply chain or security concerns.",
