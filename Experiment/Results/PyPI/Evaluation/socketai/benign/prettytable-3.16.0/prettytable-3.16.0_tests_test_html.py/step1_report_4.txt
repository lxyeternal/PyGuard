{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functionality, verifying correct HTML output and formatting options.",
  "sources": "Reads include the 'city_data' and 'helper_table' PrettyTable instances, which supply table data and configurations for HTML rendering.",
  "sinks": "The code generates HTML strings via get_html_string(), which could be a sink if malicious data were injected and improperly escaped, but here it is used only for testing output correctness.",
  "flows": "Data flows from PrettyTable objects to get_html_string() outputs, with input data and configurations (e.g., escape_header, escape_data, format) influencing the resulting HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected; the code solely performs unit testing of HTML output, with no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly tests the PrettyTable library's HTML generation capabilities, including handling of formatting, escaping, and internal borders. All input data appears controlled and intended for testing purposes. No signs of malicious input, dynamic code execution, or network interaction are present. The tests focus on verifying HTML output correctness and formatting features, with no indication of code injection or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of comprehensive unit tests for the PrettyTable HTML export functions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks. It simply validates that the library produces correct HTML under various configurations.",
