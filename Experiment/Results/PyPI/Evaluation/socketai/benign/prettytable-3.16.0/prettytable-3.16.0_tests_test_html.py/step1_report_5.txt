{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functionality, including testing various HTML output options and formatting behaviors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method calls on PrettyTable instances, such as get_html_string(), add_row(), and setting field_names, title, attributes, format, border, and preserve_internal_border properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; the code only generates HTML strings based on input data and properties without executing untrusted code or writing to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from table data and properties through HTML generation functions (e.g., get_html_string()) to produce HTML output strings. There are no external untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code strictly performs test assertions on the output.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests verifying HTML output of the PrettyTable library, including formatting, escaping, and internal border preservation features. It manipulates table data and properties to produce expected HTML strings, with assertions confirming correctness. No malicious code, external data injections, or security-critical operations are present. The code’s purpose is testing and validation of output formatting, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for PrettyTable's HTML rendering features, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It does not perform any harmful operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. Overall, it is safe and aligns with expected testing practices.",
