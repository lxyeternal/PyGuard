{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the PrettyTable library, specifically testing HTML output functions and formatting options.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from PrettyTable instances, including field names, row data, and HTML strings generated from tables.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTML strings generated by get_html_string(), which may contain user-controlled or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (field names, row data, HTML strings) through get_html_string() to output; some tests modify attributes such as title and attributes to influence HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of pytest and prettytable is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying HTML generation and formatting behaviors of the PrettyTable library. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The tests focus on output validation with various options, ensuring proper escaping and formatting. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears standard and safe, primarily intended for testing library output correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the PrettyTable library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It thoroughly tests HTML output formatting, escaping, and internal border preservation. No malicious signals or anomalies are identified.",
