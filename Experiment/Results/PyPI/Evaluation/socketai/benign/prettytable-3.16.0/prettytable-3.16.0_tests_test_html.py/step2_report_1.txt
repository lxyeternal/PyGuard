  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, correctness, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functions.\n- All reports consistently describe the code as only performing data setup, method calls, and output assertions.\n- No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are evident.\n- The data involved is static or controlled, with no external inputs or network activity.\n- The code relies on well-known testing frameworks (pytest) and a third-party library (PrettyTable).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies.\n- The tests verify correct HTML output, escaping, formatting, and internal border handling.\n- No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely for testing.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The analysis emphasizes the lack of external data, network activity, or malicious constructs.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- Since the code is only test code with no malicious intent, a risk score > 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The highest risk here is negligible; thus, 0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n### Malware score:\n\n- No malicious activity is present; scores of 0 are correct.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n- They recognize the code's purpose as testing, not executing untrusted code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close, e.g., 0.1, but 0 is fine)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, I would assign **all three scores as 0** with full confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | Clear, straightforward test code                            |\n| Risk            | 0                | No security risk or vulnerabilities identified             |\n| Confidence      | 1                | High certainty based on code review                         |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe test suite with no security concerns.",
