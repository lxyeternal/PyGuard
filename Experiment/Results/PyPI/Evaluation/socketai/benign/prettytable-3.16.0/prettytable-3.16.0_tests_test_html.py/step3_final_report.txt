{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the PrettyTable library's HTML export functions, verifying correct HTML output, escaping, formatting, and internal border handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from PrettyTable objects via method calls such as get_html_string(), add_row(), and field_names assignments.",
  "sinks": "The generated HTML strings are the primary outputs, used for assertion checks to verify correctness.",
  "flows": "Data flows from controlled test data within PrettyTable objects through method calls into HTML string outputs, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward test code with static data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that generate HTML strings from controlled PrettyTable instances. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious payloads. The escaping functions are used correctly, and the data involved is static or controlled. The tests cover various configurations, including escaping, formatting, internal borders, and special characters, all of which are standard for testing output correctness. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, controlled nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for PrettyTable's HTML output functions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate.",
