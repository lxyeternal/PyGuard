  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: The code is testing PrettyTable's HTML export functions, with input data coming from the PrettyTable objects.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: The generated HTML strings are outputs, with data flowing from the objects into HTML.\n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**: No anomalies, no malicious code, or obfuscation. The code only verifies output correctness.\n   - **Conclusion**: The code is a standard, safe test suite with no malware or security risks.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification**: No issues found; scores are reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to Report 1, testing HTML output with data from PrettyTable instances.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: The HTML strings are only generated for testing.\n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, no external data leaks.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, standard testing code.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n     - Obfuscated: 0.\n     - Risk: 0.\n   - **Justification**: No issues; scores align with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Testing HTML output, including escaping behavior.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: HTML strings generated for verification.\n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, benign test code.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0.\n     - Obfuscated: 0.\n     - Risk: 0.\n   - **Justification**: Correct and reasonable.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Similar testing of HTML generation with various configurations.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: HTML output is only for validation.\n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, standard tests.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0.\n     - Obfuscated: 0.\n     - Risk: 0.\n   - **Justification**: Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Again, testing PrettyTable's HTML rendering.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: Only output validation.\n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**: No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, straightforward test code.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0.\n     - Obfuscated: 0.\n     - Risk: 0.\n   - **Justification**: Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score**: All are 0, as the code is only testing output formatting and escaping, with no external or untrusted operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — clear, straightforward test code.\n- **Risk**: 0 — purely testing, no security risks involved.\n\n**Summary**: The entire set of reports accurately characterizes the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code content.",
