{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to display a table of Australian cities with their respective data using PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries, showcasing different table styles and themes.",
  "sources": "The data source is the hardcoded list 'ROWS' containing city information. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console via print statements. No untrusted data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'ROWS' list into the table objects (PrettyTable and ColorTable). No data is sourced from untrusted inputs or external sources; output is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code primarily performs table display functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports styling libraries and constructs tables with predefined data. It iterates over styles and themes to display different visual formats. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or external data access. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code patterns are observed. The only potential concern is the iteration over 'vars(Themes).items()', but it is used for styling and does not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data presentation script that uses external libraries solely for displaying tables with various styles and themes. There is no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no security vulnerabilities detected.",
