{
  "purpose": "The code generates styled tables displaying static city data using the PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries, applying various themes and styles without external input or network activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from predefined lists and iterates over theme attributes via vars(Themes).items() for styling purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs styled tables to the console; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static lists into table objects, then into print statements; theme attributes are read via vars(Themes).items() for styling but do not involve external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The iteration over vars(Themes).items() for theme assignment is a dynamic attribute access but is a standard, safe pattern for library styling; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using static data and well-known libraries. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The only dynamic operation is reading theme attributes via vars(), which is safe in this context. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely visual styling of tables, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight elevation of security risk score in report 5 (0.1) due to theme attribute iteration is overly cautious; a score of 0 is more appropriate. All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The overall security risk is negligible.",
