  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight elevation of security risk score in report 5 (0.1) due to theme attribute iteration is overly cautious; a score of 0 is more appropriate. All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The overall security risk is negligible."
