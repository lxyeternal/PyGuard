  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reports' claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code only imports well-known libraries (`prettytable`, `prettytable.colortable`) and uses static data.\n- It constructs tables, applies styles/themes, and prints them.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation from untrusted sources.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only potentially questionable part is iterating over `vars(Themes).items()` to set themes dynamically, but this is a standard use of the library's API.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Benign, straightforward table display.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same analysis, straightforward use of libraries.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1) due to iteration over `vars(Themes).items()`.\n- **Is this a security concern?**  \n  - The iteration over `vars(Themes).items()` is a standard way to access attributes of a class or module.\n  - It does not involve executing untrusted code or dynamic code execution.\n  - It only reads theme attributes for styling.\n  - The `Themes` object is part of the third-party library, and this pattern is common for introspection.\n  - **Conclusion:** No security risk here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the analysis, **0** is appropriate for all, as there are no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and uses standard libraries.\n\n**Risk:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor mention of iterating over `vars(Themes).items()` does not constitute a security concern.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Keep risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that no external data or code execution is involved.\n- The code is safe for use and sharing.\n\n**End of review.**",
