{
  "purpose": "The code generates and displays formatted tables of city data using the PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries, applying various styles and themes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded city information in the ROWS list.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are printed to the console; no untrusted data is written to external files or network resources.",
  "flows": "Data from the ROWS list flows into table objects, then styled and printed to the console. No external data flows back into the program.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs straightforward table formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports styling libraries and defines static data. It constructs tables, applies different styles and themes, and outputs the formatted tables to the console. No external inputs, no network activity, no data leaks, no code injections, and no obfuscated code are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a demonstration of table styling using external libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
