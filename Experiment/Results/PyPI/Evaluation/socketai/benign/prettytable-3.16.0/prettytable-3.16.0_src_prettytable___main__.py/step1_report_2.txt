{
  "purpose": "The code generates and displays tables of Australian city data using the PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries, applying various styles and themes.",
  "sources": "Data is hardcoded within the script, specifically the city names, populations, and rainfall figures. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console; no untrusted data or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the hardcoded ROWS list into the table objects, then styled and printed; no untrusted input flows or external effects occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script solely imports styling libraries, defines static data, and displays styled tables. There are no external inputs, network communications, or malicious code constructs. The code operates purely in generating formatted output with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward data display script with no suspicious activity.",
