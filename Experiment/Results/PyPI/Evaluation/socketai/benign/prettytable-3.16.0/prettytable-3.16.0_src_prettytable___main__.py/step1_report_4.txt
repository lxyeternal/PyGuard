{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to create and display formatted tables with various styles and themes using the PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the predefined ROWS list and the imported modules 'prettytable' and 'prettytable.colortable'.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print() are used to display styled tables; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data from ROWS is processed into table objects, styled, and then outputted via print() statements. No external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of standard library functions and known third-party modules appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports styling modules for table formatting, defines static data for city information, and then iteratively creates and displays tables with different styles and themes. No input from external sources, no data manipulation from untrusted sources, and no network or file operations are present. All modules are standard or well-known third-party packages used for formatting. The code’s structure is straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of styling tables using third-party libraries. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and serves a presentation purpose.",
