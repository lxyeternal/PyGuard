{
  "purpose": "This code generates and displays tabular data about Australian cities using the PrettyTable and ColorTable libraries, applying various styles and themes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the ROWS list and configuration data from imported modules and variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data to external sources or outputs untrusted data externally; it only prints styled tables to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the ROWS list into table objects, which are then styled and printed; no untrusted external data or network flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code only manipulates internal data structures and display formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports styling modules and applies various styles and themes to tables generated from static data. The logic is straightforward, involving no dynamic code execution, no external inputs, and no sensitive operations. It simply formats and prints data using third-party libraries without any indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data display script utilizing third-party libraries for formatting tables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data manipulation, and no security risks identified.",
