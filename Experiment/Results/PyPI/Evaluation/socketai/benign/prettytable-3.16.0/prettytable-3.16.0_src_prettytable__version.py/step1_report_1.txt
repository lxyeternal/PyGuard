{
  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools-scm, without performing any specific runtime or operational logic.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__, version) and version tuple (__version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data processing or transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external inputs, or obfuscation. No unusual code constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version information variables using static strings and tuples. It includes a conditional for type checking with no runtime logic beyond defining variables. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited or used maliciously. The code appears to be auto-generated by a version management tool and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition file generated by setuptools-scm. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
