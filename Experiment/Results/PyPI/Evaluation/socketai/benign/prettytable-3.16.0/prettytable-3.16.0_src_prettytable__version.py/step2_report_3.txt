  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their claims against the provided code.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Claim**: The code is a benign version definition with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Analysis**: The code is static, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic or external inputs.\n   - **Verdict**: Accurate. No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Claim**: Straightforward, benign, with standard use of type hints.\n   - **Analysis**: No suspicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation.\n   - **Verdict**: Correct. No concerns.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Claim**: Simple version metadata with no malicious intent.\n   - **Analysis**: All static, no external inputs or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Verdict**: Valid. No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Claim**: Assigns static version data, no external data or malicious code.\n   - **Analysis**: Static assignments, standard pattern, no obfuscation.\n   - **Verdict**: Accurate. No problems.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Claim**: Defines version info with static variables, generated by setuptools-scm.\n   - **Analysis**: No dynamic code, no external inputs, no obfuscation.\n   - **Verdict**: Correct. No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, static version declaration file with no external dependencies, inputs, or outputs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of type hints and conditional for TYPE_CHECKING is standard practice.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics. There is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior in this version metadata file.",
