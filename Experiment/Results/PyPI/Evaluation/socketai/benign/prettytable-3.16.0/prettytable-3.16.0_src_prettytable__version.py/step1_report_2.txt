  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded version strings and assigns version variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded version string flows into version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING block is standard; no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting version metadata with static values. It contains no external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is typical for type hints. The comments indicate that this file is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked in version control. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version information definition file with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
