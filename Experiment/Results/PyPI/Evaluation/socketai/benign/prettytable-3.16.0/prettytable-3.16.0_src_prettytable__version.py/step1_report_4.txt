  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static assignment and type annotations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources; straightforward assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version metadata for a Python package, assigning fixed version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional block for type checking imports, which is standard for type hints. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or data leaks. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard version declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and appears safe.",
