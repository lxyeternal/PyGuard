  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version variables).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard version definition pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version metadata module generated by setuptools-scm, containing hardcoded version strings and type hints. There are no external inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code structure is straightforward, serving solely to store version information. It explicitly states it is auto-generated and does not include any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to define version information in a standard way without any suspicious or harmful code elements.",
