  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using static variables, primarily generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, external inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, static, and generated by a known versioning tool.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables with hardcoded static values. There are no dynamic inputs, no data flow from external sources, and no complex logic or obfuscated code. It explicitly avoids any user input, network activity, or file I/O. The only operations are variable assignments with known, static strings and tuples. It is a typical version definition module generated by setuptools-scm, which is common and trustworthy. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static version information module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
