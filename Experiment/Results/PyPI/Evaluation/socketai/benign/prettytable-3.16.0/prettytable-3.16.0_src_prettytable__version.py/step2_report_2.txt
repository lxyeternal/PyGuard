  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward, static version definition module generated by setuptools-scm.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is solely to define version metadata with hardcoded strings and tuples.\n- The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, and the code itself does not contain any. It’s purely metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives. The code is static and benign.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Potential issues or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No inconsistencies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is justified given the clear, static nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately rated. The code is a standard version metadata module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, and the assessments are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
