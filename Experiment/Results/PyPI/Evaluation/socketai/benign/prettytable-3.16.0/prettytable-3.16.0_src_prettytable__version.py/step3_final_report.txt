  "purpose": "Static version metadata declaration generated by setuptools-scm, used for version tracking in Python packages.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__, version) and version tuple (version_tuple, __version_tuple__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module defining version information with no external data handling, dynamic code, or network activity. It uses standard type hinting and conditional imports for type checking. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. All signals indicate benign, static metadata code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's characteristics.",
