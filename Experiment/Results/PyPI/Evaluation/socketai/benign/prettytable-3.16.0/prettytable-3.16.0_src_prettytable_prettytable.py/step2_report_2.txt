  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides a comprehensive table rendering library with multiple input sources (rows, JSON, HTML, CSV, database cursors).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Outputs are string representations in various formats; data is escaped in HTML outputs. No dangerous code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses standard modules; warnings are issued via `warnings.warn` for deprecation, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, safe, and uses standard practices. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscation are 0.0. Risk score should be very low, e.g., **0.1**.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Empty response, no information.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Cannot evaluate; no data.\n- **Scores:** No basis for any score. Default to **0** for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, a robust table library with multiple data input methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data is escaped properly for HTML; no unsafe code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses standard modules; warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard, and well-maintained. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** High confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated are 0.0. Risk score should be **0.1**.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on data formatting.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Perfect confidence (1.0). Malware and obfuscated are 0.0. Risk score: **0.1**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Empty response:** No data to evaluate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or similar code—no evidence of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Consistently 0 across reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, the risk should be minimal, e.g., **0.1**.\n- **Confidence:** Very high (above 0.9) that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to extensive escaping, standard modules, and no malicious behavior)\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the use of `warnings.warn` for deprecation, which is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-maintained tabular data formatting library with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
