  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a comprehensive table formatting library that reads data from various sources (rows, JSON, HTML, CSV, database cursors). Correct.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that output is generated via string buffers in multiple formats, with escaping in HTML to prevent injection. No execution of untrusted code.\n\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** Correctly states no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard modules. Warnings are benign. No network or system calls.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is thorough and aligns with the code's content. The code appears benign, well-maintained, and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe, with malware score 0 and high confidence (0.95), is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 & 5:**  \n- **Error:** Empty response. No analysis provided.\n\n**Verdict:** No assessment possible; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a table formatting library with multiple output formats and data sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that data is escaped for HTML/XML outputs, and no code execution or network activity occurs.\n\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious patterns. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate, with a high confidence (0.9), and malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign and safe is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**  \n- **Error:** Empty response.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a feature-rich, well-structured table formatting library. It handles multiple formats, escapes HTML content, and reads data from various sources using safe libraries.\n\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no file system modifications, and no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Escaping & Safety:** Proper escaping functions are used in HTML output to prevent injection. No unsafe eval or exec calls.\n\n- **Deprecation Handling:** Uses warnings.warn, which is standard and benign.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and maintainable.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-maintained utility for table rendering and data export, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports agree on the benign nature of the code. The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
