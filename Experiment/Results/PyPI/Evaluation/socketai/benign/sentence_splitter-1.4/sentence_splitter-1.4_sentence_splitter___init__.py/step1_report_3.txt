{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sentence splitting utility for text, based on heuristic rules, with optional support for non-breaking prefixes loaded from files.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in the split method and non-breaking prefix files loaded during __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified. No data leaks, system commands, or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through regex transformations and tokenization. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks such as system calls, network, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard library functions and regex for text processing without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on language codes, loads non-breaking prefix data from files, and applies regex-based rules for sentence segmentation. It uses standard libraries and does not include any network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The file handling is straightforward, with no indications of malicious payloads or backdoors. The regex patterns are complex but serve legitimate linguistic processing purposes. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or other security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of a heuristic sentence splitter. No malicious intent or harmful behavior is evident. It relies on common text processing techniques with safe file handling and regex operations.",
