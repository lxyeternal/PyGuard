  "purpose": "Heuristic NLP sentence splitter using regex patterns and external prefix data files for language-specific sentence boundary detection.",
  "sources": "Reads non-breaking prefix files based on language code; processes input text with regex transformations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications; primarily processes text and reads files.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex-based sentence boundary insertions -> split into sentences; prefix files influence splitting logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; regex is complex but purposeful.",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex-based sentence segmentation, loading prefix data from external files. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Regex patterns serve linguistic purposes, and file handling is standard. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are justified, with minimal external dependency risk. No anomalies or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate NLP utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. External prefix files pose a supply chain risk but do not constitute malicious code. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2 are appropriate.",
