{
  "purpose": "This code provides a heuristic-based sentence splitter for text in various languages, primarily intended for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "File system access to load non-breaking prefix files; reading input parameter 'text' for splitting.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no network, system, or data exfiltration functions present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through various regex-based transformations to produce sentence boundaries, with non-breaking prefixes loaded from files influencing sentence splitting logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of regex for complex text processing appears standard for this purpose. No obfuscated code detected. The code's only external interaction is loading prefix files based on language codes.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by validating language codes and loading non-breaking prefix data from files, which could potentially be manipulated if the files are maliciously crafted. The main split method applies multiple regex substitutions to identify sentence boundaries, considering honorifics, acronyms, and specific punctuation cases. There is no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. The code operates within typical NLP preprocessing scope without any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a heuristic sentence splitter using regex and file-based prefix data. It does not contain malicious or sabotage behavior, nor does it exhibit suspicious external activity or hidden backdoors. Its security risk is very low.",
