{
  "purpose": "The code implements a heuristic-based sentence splitter for text in multiple languages, primarily for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in the split() method; reads non-breaking prefix files from the filesystem during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Does not write or transmit untrusted data; primarily processes data in memory. No explicit data leaks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through regex-based transformations in split(), with data loaded from files into internal dictionaries. No external network or system calls are made during processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external files for non-breaking prefixes, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. The regex patterns are complex but consistent with sentence segmentation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code loads non-breaking prefix data from specified files, using standard file I/O with encoding. It performs multiple regex substitutions to segment text into sentences. Input data is from function parameters, with no external network calls or system modifications. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of regex and file I/O appears benign and purpose-driven. No obfuscation, malicious code injection, or suspicious data handling was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sentence segmentation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs expected operations for NLP preprocessing, with safe file handling and no network activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
