  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sentence_splitter' Python package, managing package metadata, requirements, and data files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reads package data files for inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way or could leak sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from 'requirements.txt' file into install_requirements list; uses package data for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It reads dependencies from an external file, defines package metadata, and includes package data files. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or potentially malicious code is present. The code appears typical and safe, serving purely as a configuration and packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. It functions solely to package the project for distribution.",
