{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sentence_splitter' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt file for dependencies; static metadata fields within setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no handling of untrusted input data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Read requirements.txt -> setup configuration -> package metadata and data definitions; no dynamic data flows or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code strictly performs package setup functions.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from a local requirements.txt file, then invokes setuptools.setup() with fixed metadata, dependencies, and package data. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network interaction. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The setup process appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior, only package configuration details. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
