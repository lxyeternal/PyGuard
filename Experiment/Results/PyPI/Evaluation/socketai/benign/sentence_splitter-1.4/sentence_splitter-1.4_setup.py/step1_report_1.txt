  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sentence_splitter' Python package, primarily used to specify package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; no other input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no output or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file, then proceeds with package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations using setuptools. It reads dependencies from a requirements.txt file and configures package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, external calls, or obfuscated code. All code appears to be typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package installation configuration and dependencies. No suspicious activity or malware indications are present.",
