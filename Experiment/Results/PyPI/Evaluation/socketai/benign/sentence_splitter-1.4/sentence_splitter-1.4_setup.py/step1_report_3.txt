  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python module called 'sentence_splitter'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, and uses package data from 'non_breaking_prefixes' directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file -> Uses setup() to configure package parameters -> Loads package data and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code follows standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py used for packaging a Python project. It reads dependencies from a requirements.txt file and configures package metadata. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and intended for standard distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is benign and solely for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
