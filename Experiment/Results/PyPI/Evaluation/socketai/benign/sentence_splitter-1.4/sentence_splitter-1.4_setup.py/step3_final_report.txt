  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'sentence_splitter' Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'; no untrusted input sources; static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and passes data to setuptools; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging. It performs static configuration tasks: reading dependencies, setting metadata, and including package data. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or obfuscated segments. The code aligns with best practices and contains no suspicious patterns. All signals point to benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
