  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of graph label informativeness metrics. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk scores of 0 (or very close to zero) are appropriate. Overall, the code is safe for use in graph analysis tasks."
