{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute label informativeness metrics for graph datasets, specifically for assessing the predictive power of neighboring node labels.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'to_bidirected' function from the current package, optional import of torch, and uses input parameters like graph and y (node labels). The code reads node label tensors and graph structure.",
  "sinks": "Uses torch tensor operations, especially in calculations involving probabilities and logarithms. No data is written to external locations or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input node labels (y) and graph structure are processed to compute probabilities and mutual information metrics. The data flows through tensor calculations and functions that compute entropy-based metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious string or network activity. The functions perform standard entropy and probability calculations with no signs of hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of label informativeness metrics based on mutual information and entropy calculations, using torch tensors. It imports and uses 'to_bidirected' for graph processing, ensuring undirected graphs are handled appropriately. No external data or network operations are involved. The code performs probabilistic calculations, which appear standard and relevant to the described purpose. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, purpose-built for graph analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data solely for the purpose of calculating label informativeness metrics without engaging in any harmful or covert activities.",
