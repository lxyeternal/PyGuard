  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The functions compute label informativeness using standard entropy and mutual information calculations, importing 'to_bidirected' and torch.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, external data, or network activity. Uses standard scientific methods.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe, no malicious intent. Confidence 0.95, malware 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, functions for label informativeness, standard tensor operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility functions, safe, straightforward. Confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on mutual information metrics.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly benign, standard scientific code. Confidence 0.95, malware 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Computes label informativeness with mutual information, standard approach.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external data flow.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1, but this appears to be a conservative estimate; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, legitimate code. Confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, functions for mutual information based metrics.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe, standard scientific code. Confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward implementation of entropy and mutual information calculations for graph datasets. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data exfiltration.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:** Consistently zero across all reports, aligned with the code's transparent nature.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, primarily because the code performs statistical calculations without external dependencies or network activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, should be **below 0.1**, perhaps **0.05**, to reflect minimal concern.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.05  |\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for graph analysis, with no security threats or malicious intent.",
