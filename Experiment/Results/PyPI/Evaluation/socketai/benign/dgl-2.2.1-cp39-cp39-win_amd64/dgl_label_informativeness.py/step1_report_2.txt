  "purpose": "Provide functions to compute graph label informativeness metrics for node classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports of torch, to_bidirected; usage of graph data structures and node labels y; internal computations of probabilities, entropies, and mutual information.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No code writes to files, sends data over networks, executes system commands, or handles sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input: graph and node labels y. The functions compute probabilities, entropy, and mutual information based on graph structure and labels. No data leaves the system or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard scientific computing methods for probability and entropy calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to compute label informativeness metrics based on graph structures and node labels, utilizing torch for tensor operations. It checks for PyTorch installation, converts graphs to bidirected form, calculates class and degree-based probabilities, and computes normalized mutual information. The code appears well-structured, uses appropriate numerical stability measures, and adheres to expected scientific computing practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides legitimate utility functions for measuring label informativeness in graph datasets. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and performs calculations consistent with research literature. Overall, it appears safe and intended solely for analytical purposes.",
