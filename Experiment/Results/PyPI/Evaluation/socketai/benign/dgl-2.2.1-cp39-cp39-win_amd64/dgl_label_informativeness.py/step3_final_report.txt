  "purpose": "Utility functions for computing label informativeness metrics in graph datasets, based on entropy and mutual information calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads node labels (y), graph structure (graph), and internal tensor operations; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Internal tensor computations; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "flows": "From node labels and graph structure through probability and entropy calculations, with no external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard entropy and mutual information calculations for graph label analysis, utilizing torch tensors and graph transformations. It includes dependency checks and standard numerical stability measures. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration are present. The functions are purpose-specific, well-documented, and rely solely on internal computations. The security risk scores in the reports are very low, justified by the benign nature of the calculations. The malware scores are correctly set to zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of graph label informativeness metrics. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk scores of 0 (or very close to zero) are appropriate. Overall, the code is safe for use in graph analysis tasks.",
