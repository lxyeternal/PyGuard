  "purpose": "Utility functions for computing graph label informativeness in graph datasets, specifically for analyzing the amount of information shared between node labels in a graph.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module (. to_bidirected), torch library, input parameters such as graph and y (node labels), and internal computations involving graph edges and node degrees.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident; computations involve internal tensor operations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors (graph, y), through graph transformations, degree calculations, and probabilistic calculations to the output scalar value representing label informativeness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs are present. The code strictly performs statistical calculations on graph data without hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical analysis on graph data, computing mutual information-based metrics for node and edge label informativeness. It relies on standard PyTorch tensor operations, graph transformations, and entropy calculations. The function check_pytorch() ensures dependency presence. No external or network I/O, cryptic code, or suspicious behavior detected. All operations are standard for graph data analysis. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and uses conventional methods for entropy and mutual information calculations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for calculating graph label informativeness. It performs standard statistical computations without malicious intent or security risks. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
