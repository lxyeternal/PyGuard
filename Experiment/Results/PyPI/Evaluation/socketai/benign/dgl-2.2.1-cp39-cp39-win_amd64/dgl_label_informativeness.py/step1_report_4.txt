  "purpose": "Utility functions for computing label informativeness metrics (edge and node) for graph datasets, based on mutual information concepts.",
  "sources": "Reads graph data (graph object), node labels (y tensor), and imported modules such as torch and to_bidirected.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations involving probability distributions, entropy, and mutual information; no data is sent externally or to network.",
  "flows": "Inputs (graph, y) are processed through probability calculations and entropy formulas; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; functions involve standard statistical calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The import and usage of torch is standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to compute mutual information-based metrics on graph data, utilizing torch for tensor computations. It includes checks for PyTorch presence, conversions of graphs to bidirected form, and calculations of class probabilities, edge probabilities, and entropy-based measures. The logic is consistent with standard practices in graph analysis and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external data exfiltration, network communication, or system modifications are present. No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for graph dataset analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of mutual information metrics for graph datasets. It does not exhibit malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured, transparent, and uses common libraries for scientific computation. Overall, it presents a low security threat with no evidence of malware.",
