{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to compute graph label informativeness metrics for node classification datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from graph object and node labels (y); uses torch for numerical calculations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; computations are purely statistical and do not perform data exfiltration or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (graph and labels) flows through probability calculations and entropy-based formulas within functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of PyTorch and performs graph transformations with 'to_bidirected'. It computes label informativeness by calculating mutual information between node labels across edges, employing entropy and probability calculations with stable numerical methods. The functions are well-documented, standard in statistical graph analysis, and do not include external network calls, file operations, or hidden behaviors. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident. The code adheres to typical data science practices, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of graph label informativeness metrics with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs statistical calculations safely and appropriately, with no suspicious anomalies.",
