  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of graph homophily measures with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's nature, though the risk could be considered zero if assuming trusted inputs."
