  "purpose": "Provides various measures of graph homophily and heterophily for graph analysis, primarily used in node classification tasks within graph neural networks.",
  "sources": "Reads graph edges (graph.edges()), node labels (y), and node degrees (graph.in_degrees()). No user input or external data sources are read directly.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical homophily metrics as floats. Uses internal computations only; no data leakage, system info, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input graph and node labels are processed through internal functions to compute homophily measures. No external data transmission or command execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The code involves standard graph computations. No obfuscated or unusual language features. The only dynamic aspect is the use of tensor computations, which is standard for this library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute various graph homophily metrics using torch and DGL graph library. It checks for PyTorch presence before computations. The functions perform standard graph operations: fetching edges, computing class matches, updating node data, and calculating ratios. The adjusted homophily function converts graphs to bidirectional and computes class-based degree sums. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as system modification, data exfiltration, or network activity. The code relies solely on internal graph and tensor data, with no external communication or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of graph homophily measurement functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs standard graph analysis operations securely without external communication or harmful actions.",
