  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating various homophily measures in graph datasets, used in node classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads graph edges, node labels (y), and graph attributes such as degrees.",
  "sinks": "Performs computations based on node labels and graph structure; no explicit data sinks for external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads node labels (y) and graph edges; computes similarity indicators and statistical measures; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors identified. Usage of standard libraries (torch, DGL) appears legitimate. The code performs standard homophily calculations with no hidden data collection or system access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions to compute homophily metrics in graph datasets, using standard graph processing and tensor operations. It imports torch for tensor computations and a graph library (likely DGL). The functions perform straightforward mathematical calculations without external communication, obfuscation, or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is consistent with academic and research purposes, with no signs of malware or sabotage. It simply reads graph data, node labels, and performs standard statistical analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for graph homophily measurement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard libraries and functions appropriately. No suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
