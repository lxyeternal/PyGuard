  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for graph feature processing in GNNs. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by the potential for input misuse, but do not constitute malicious behavior."
