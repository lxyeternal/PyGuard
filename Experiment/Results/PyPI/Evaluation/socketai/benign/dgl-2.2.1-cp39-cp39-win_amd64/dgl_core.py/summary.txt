  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and consistent with typical GNN framework implementations. No malicious activity or sabotage detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of user-defined functions, which is an accepted risk in such systems. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate."
