      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for graph feature processing in GNNs. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by the potential for input misuse, but do not constitute malicious behavior."

The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects potential misuse of shared memory features but does not indicate an actual threat."

Overall, the code is safe for use in graph analysis tasks."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's nature, though the risk could be considered zero if assuming trusted inputs."

The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of user-defined functions, which is an accepted risk in such systems.
