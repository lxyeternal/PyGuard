  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the function as merging graphs, reading node/edge types, features, and data frames.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; data flows internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate description; the code performs standard merging by concatenating edges, copying node features, and updating data frames.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the utility nature, reading graphs and data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates a new graph, no external output.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Describes the merging process accurately, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes input list, data, types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; data is merged internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Describes data copying, node addition, and feature merging accurately.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, input graphs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal data manipulation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Describes the merging process accurately, with standard operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies internal attribute access (`_edge_frames`, `_node_frames`) as part of internal API usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into the new graph object.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of internal attributes might be unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Detailed explanation of the merging process; no network or external operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; internal API usage is typical in library code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate graph merging utility.\n- No suspicious code patterns, external communications, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Use of internal attributes (`_edge_frames`, `_node_frames`) is consistent with internal API usage, not malicious obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and uses internal API attributes transparently.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code relies on internal attributes (`_edge_frames`, `_node_frames`). While this is generally acceptable within library internals, if exposed externally, it could pose maintenance or stability concerns. However, nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- The merging process is typical for graph data structures, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code review, I agree with the assessments. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be set to 0.** The code is a legitimate utility function for graph merging with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Overall malware score: 0**\n\n**Overall obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Overall security risk score: 0**",
