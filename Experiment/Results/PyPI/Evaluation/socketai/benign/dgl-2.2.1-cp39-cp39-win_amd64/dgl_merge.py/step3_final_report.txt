  "purpose": "Utility function for merging multiple DGLGraph objects into a single graph, combining nodes, edges, and features.",
  "sources": "Reads node types, edge types, edge data, node features, and internal data frames (_edge_frames, _node_frames) from input graphs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is manipulated internally within the graph objects, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input graphs through concatenation and copying into a new merged graph, updating node and edge data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal attributes (_edge_frames, _node_frames) but this is standard within internal API usage; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard graph merging: initializes an empty heterograph, concatenates edge data, adds nodes (including isolated ones), and copies node features. No external communication, no malicious code, and no obfuscation detected. Use of internal attributes is typical for internal API functions, not malicious. No signs of data leaks, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for graph merging within the DGL framework. All signals indicate benign, routine data manipulation without malicious intent or security risks.",
