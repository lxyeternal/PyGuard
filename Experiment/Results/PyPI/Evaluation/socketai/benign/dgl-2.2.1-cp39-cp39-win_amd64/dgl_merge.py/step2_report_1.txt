  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the claims are justified and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report claims the code is a standard utility for merging graphs, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs typical graph merging operations: concatenating edges, copying node features, adding nodes, updating data frames. No external network calls, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward and standard for graph merging. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard data manipulation routines with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** The code reads graph data, concatenates features, creates a new graph, and adds nodes/edges accordingly. No network activity or external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code merges graphs, handling node/edge data, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Uses typical data copying, concatenation, and node/edge addition. No external communication or system modifications.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard graph merging routines, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Data flows are internal, with no external network activity. Uses standard API functions.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard graph merging, internal data handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Uses internal attributes like '_edge_frames' and '_node_frames', but these are part of the internal API. No external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate. The internal API usage is acceptable within library code. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical graph merging utility.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected; all reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code performs internal data manipulation without external communication.\n- **Score consistency:** All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility function for merging graphs within the DGL framework. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
