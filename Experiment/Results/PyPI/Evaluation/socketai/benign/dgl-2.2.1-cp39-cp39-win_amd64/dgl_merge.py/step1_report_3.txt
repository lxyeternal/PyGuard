  "purpose": "Utilities for merging multiple DGLGraph objects into a single graph, preserving and updating node and edge data.",
  "sources": "Input list of graphs (`graphs` parameter), graph edge data, node data, and type information.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the function modifies and returns a merged graph object. No network transmissions or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input graphs are read for nodes, edges, and data; the function consolidates this information into a new graph, updating node and edge data accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of standard library functions and straightforward data operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility function for merging graphs, primarily performing data copying, concatenation, and addition of nodes and edges. It uses the DGL library and tensor operations from the backend `F`. No network communications, file I/O, or external commands are invoked. The logic follows typical graph merging procedures. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for merging graphs within the DGL framework. It performs data aggregation and graph modification without malicious intent. No malware or security risks are identified.",
