  "purpose": "Utility function to merge multiple graphs into a single graph, preserving nodes, edges, and their features.",
  "sources": "Reads graph data such as node and edge types, edge connections, node features, and edge features from input graph objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks; the code primarily manipulates graph data internally without external data transmission or user input/output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input graph list to merged graph through copying node features, edge connections, and feature data, without external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; code structure is standard for graph merging functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to merge multiple graph objects. It initializes an empty heterograph and iteratively adds edges and nodes from each input graph, updating node features and concatenating edge features. The process involves copying data between graph objects, handling node/edge types, and updating internal data frames. All operations are typical for graph data manipulation and do not involve external data sources or dangerous operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate utility for merging graph data structures with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform network operations, handle sensitive external input, or contain hidden behaviors. The implementation is consistent with normal graph processing functions.",
