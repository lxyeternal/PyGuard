{
  "purpose": "Defines internal constants, utility functions, warning handling, and initializes internal API for a graph library (likely DGL).",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, use of standard library warnings, and internal constants.",
  "sinks": "Warnings formatting and emitting via warnings.warn.",
  "flows": "Warning message generated in dgl_warning() flows through warnings.warn(), formatted by dgl_warning_format().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily sets up constants, warning customization, and initializes an API.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines constants for internal use, provides utility functions for internal checks, and customizes warning formatting and handling. The warning functions override default behavior but do not perform any malicious actions. Initialization of internal API is straightforward, with no code execution from untrusted sources or external data. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. Overall, this appears to be a standard setup module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for a graph library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It handles internal constants, warning formatting, and API initialization without performing any harmful actions.",
