  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, only utility functions and constants.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero).  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score seems to reflect cautiousness but not actual malicious behavior. Given the code's benign nature, this is acceptable but could be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same benign setup, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct given the code clarity.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight inconsistency—Report 2 assigns 0.1 risk despite benign code. Given the code's straightforward nature, this should be 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module for internal constants, warning handling, and API initialization.  \n- No external input processing, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no secrets, and no malicious behaviors are present.  \n- The warning formatting customization is a benign override, common in library development.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities evident)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The only minor adjustment is to set the risk score in Report 2 to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set risk score to 0 across all reports, including Report 2, to reflect the code's benign nature accurately.",
