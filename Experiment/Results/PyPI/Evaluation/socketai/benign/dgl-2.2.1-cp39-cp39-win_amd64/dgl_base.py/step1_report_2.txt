{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions, constants, and warning handling for the DGL library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and internal functions, constants definitions, and warning formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn call, which outputs warnings; import of internal CFFI functions; use of internal constants and functions.",
  "flows": "Imports and internal function calls flow from source modules to warning functions and internal API initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Warning formatting appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants, warning handling, and internal API initialization for the DGL library. Functions like is_internal_column and is_all are simple checks. The warning customization modifies standard Python warnings to prepend 'DGL Warning' in messages. Importing internal functions and initializing internal API are standard for library setup. No code appears malicious or maliciously obfuscated. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility/setup code for a graph library, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It primarily handles warnings and defines constants. No security risks or malware observed.",
