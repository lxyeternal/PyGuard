  "purpose": "Utility module for internal constants, warning customization, and API initialization within the DGL framework.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions, import statements, warning formatting override, internal API initialization.",
  "sinks": "Warnings emitted via warnings.warn, no external untrusted data processed.",
  "flows": "Warning functions called, internal constants accessed, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as internal setup for the library. It manages constants, customizes warning formatting, and initializes internal APIs. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The warning override is a benign customization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
