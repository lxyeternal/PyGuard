{
  "purpose": "Defines internal constants, utility functions, and warning mechanisms for the DGL (Deep Graph Library) framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, internal modules (.ffi.base, .ffi.function), standard warnings module, and the module's own constants and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to warnings.warn() and modifies warnings.formatwarning.",
  "flows": "Warning message generated by dgl_warning() flows through warnings.warn() with custom formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes constants, checks, and warning formats for internal use. It overrides the default warning formatting to provide custom warning messages. There are no inputs from external sources, no network or file operations, and no handling of untrusted data. All functions serve standard utility purposes within a library. The import of internal modules is typical for a package, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module setting up internal constants and warning behavior for the library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
