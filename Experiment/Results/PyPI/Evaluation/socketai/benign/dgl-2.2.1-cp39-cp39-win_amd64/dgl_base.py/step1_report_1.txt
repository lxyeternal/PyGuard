{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions, constants, and warning handling for the DGL (Deep Graph Library) framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines constants, and functions for internal column checks and warning formatting.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are issued via warnings.warn; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (like warning messages) flows into warnings.warn and formatting functions, but no untrusted external input is processed or output directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code mostly defines constants and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up internal constants and functions for handling internal columns and warnings within the DGL library. It redefines the warning format function to prepend 'DGL Warning:' to messages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code does not process external untrusted inputs or execute dynamic code. It simply manages internal warnings and constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for internal use within the DGL framework. It does not contain malicious code or malware, and no security risks are evident. It primarily manages warning formatting and internal constants.",
