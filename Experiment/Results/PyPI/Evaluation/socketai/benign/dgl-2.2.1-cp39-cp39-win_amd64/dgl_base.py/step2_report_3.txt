  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a utility module for the DGL (Deep Graph Library).\n- It defines constants related to internal columns, special symbols, and internal types.\n- It provides functions to check if a column is internal or if an argument signifies \"all.\"\n- It customizes the warning formatting to prepend \"DGL Warning:\".\n- It initializes internal APIs via `_init_internal_api()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- **Functionality:** All functions are straightforward, utility-based, and serve internal purposes.\n- **External inputs/outputs:** No external untrusted data is processed or output directly.\n- **Malicious behaviors:** No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The code mainly manages internal constants, warning customization, and API initialization.\n- The import statements are from internal modules, typical for a library setup.\n- Warning formatting is overridden, but this is standard practice for customizing warning messages.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risk identified.\n\nAll reports agree on these points, with confidence levels close to 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (benign utility code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** **0.0** (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard internal utility module for the DGL library. It handles constants, warning formatting, and API initialization without any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe.",
