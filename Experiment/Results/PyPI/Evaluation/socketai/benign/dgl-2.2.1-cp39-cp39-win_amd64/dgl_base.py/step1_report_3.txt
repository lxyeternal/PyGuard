{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions, constants, and warning handling for a graph processing library (DGL).",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_ffi), constants defined within the module, and functions that handle warnings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain obvious sinks for untrusted data; the only output is warning messages formatted for display.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; mostly internal constant definitions and warning handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The module initializes constants and internal APIs for DGL, overrides warning formatting, and defines helper functions for internal columns and special symbols. It imports internal components, defines constants for internal columns, and provides simple utility functions. The warning system customization is straightforward and uses standard Python warnings. No input handling, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for internal use in a graph library. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages constants and warning formatting, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
