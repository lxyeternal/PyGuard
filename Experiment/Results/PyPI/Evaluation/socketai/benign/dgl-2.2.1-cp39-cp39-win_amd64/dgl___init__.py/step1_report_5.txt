  "purpose": "This code defines the structure and import statements for the 'dgl' package, which provides data structures and utilities for graph processing.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules, functions, and classes from internal package files and initializes some modules. No direct input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code primarily consists of import statements and module initialization.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only imports modules and initializes package components.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The socket import is used for Windows compatibility and does not perform malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements for internal modules, classes, and functions necessary for the package's operation. It includes a socket import for Windows compatibility and conditional import based on backend type. No malicious logic, data handling, or network communication is present. The socket import is justified for system compatibility and cleanup, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The socket import is used for system compatibility and cleanup, not for malicious purposes.",
