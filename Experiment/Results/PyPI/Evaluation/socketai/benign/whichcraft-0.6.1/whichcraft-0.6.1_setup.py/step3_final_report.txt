{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for the 'whichcraft' Python package, managing installation, publishing, and version tagging.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, HISTORY.rst, and requirements files; command-line arguments for 'publish' and 'tag'; uses os.system() for executing build, upload, and git commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing static commands; no untrusted data influence.",
  "flows": "Command-line args ('publish', 'tag') trigger os.system() commands for build/upload/tag; no data flows from untrusted sources into these commands.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; commands are static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with controlled command execution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Use of os.system() is typical but could be improved with subprocess for security hygiene. No signs of obfuscation or secrets. The command-line argument checks are explicit and do not incorporate untrusted input into system calls. Overall, the script is safe and typical for open-source package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of os.system() is controlled and does not pose a significant threat in this context. All signals indicate a benign supply chain component.",
