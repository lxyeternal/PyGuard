  "purpose": "A backport implementation of shutil.which() for Python versions earlier than 3.3, locating executables in the system PATH.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'PATH' and 'PATHEXT', filesystem checks via os.path.exists and os.access, platform-specific path handling.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access for locating files; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks guide the search for executable files in specified directories.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard utility function for locating executables, compatible with older Python versions. It performs environment variable reads and filesystem checks in a typical manner. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common practices. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a system utility function with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
