{
  "purpose": "Provides a backported implementation of shutil.which() to locate executable files in the system's PATH, compatible with Python versions prior to 3.3.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH' and 'PATHEXT'), and input command strings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code only locates files and does not perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input command -> environment variables -> directory search -> file access checks -> output path of executable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the existence and executability of a given command by searching through PATH directories, considering platform-specific behaviors (Windows vs. others). It handles importing 'which' from shutil or defines a fallback implementation. No dynamic code execution, no external network activity, and no obfuscation. The logic is consistent with a standard file lookup function, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard utility function for locating executables in the system path, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a benign, utility-based implementation with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
