{
  "purpose": "Define a cross-platform 'which' function to locate executables in the system PATH, with compatibility for Python versions prior to 3.3.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH', 'PATHEXT'), system platform info, input command string, and filesystem checks.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access functions (os.path.exists, os.access) for verifying executable files; environment variables influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and input command → path splitting and normalization → filesystem access checks to locate executable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. The code reimplements a standard utility ('which') for compatibility reasons, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a compatibility implementation of 'which', considering platform-specific behaviors and environment variables. It performs filesystem checks to identify executables matching the input command. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The code is a straightforward utility reimplementation with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility implementation for locating executables, intended for compatibility with older Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
