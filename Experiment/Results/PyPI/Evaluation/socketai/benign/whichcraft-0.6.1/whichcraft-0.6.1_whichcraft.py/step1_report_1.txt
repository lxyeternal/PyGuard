{
  "purpose": "The code provides a backport implementation of the shutil.which function, used to locate the full path of an executable command in the system PATH.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH, PATHEXT) and input command string; accesses filesystem to check for file existence and executability.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access functions (os.path.exists, os.access) potentially reveal file locations; environment variable reading (os.environ) may leak environment info.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (PATH, PATHEXT) → filesystem checks via _access_check → return executable path if found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; code is a standard backported implementation of shutil.which with no malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fallback for shutil.which, intended for compatibility with older Python versions. It carefully handles environment variables, platform differences, and filesystem checks. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions perform standard system queries and path resolutions. No anomalies or suspicious logic are present beyond typical system path searches.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a system utility function with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It serves a benign purpose to locate executables in the system PATH, compatible with older Python versions.",
