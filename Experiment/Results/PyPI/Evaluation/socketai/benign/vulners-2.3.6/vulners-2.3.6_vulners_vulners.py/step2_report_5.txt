  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the potential security implications, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a Python API wrapper for Vulners, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily a standard API client with no evident malicious intent. The analysis notes no unsafe code, no backdoors, no data exfiltration, and proper handling of data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe handling of ZIP files, JSON parsing, and standard API request construction.\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly notes the safe processing of ZIP archives, no malicious code, and no obfuscation. The warnings and deprecation notices are typical and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified, no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard libraries, safe JSON/ZIP handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code handles ZIP files and JSON safely, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. Warnings are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is a standard API client, with safe data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The review notes that ZIP file processing and JSON parsing are standard and safe, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, describes the code as a comprehensive API client with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly points out the safe handling of ZIP files, no malicious payloads, and proper data validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, data leaks, or sabotage, a risk score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a well-structured, standard API client library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
