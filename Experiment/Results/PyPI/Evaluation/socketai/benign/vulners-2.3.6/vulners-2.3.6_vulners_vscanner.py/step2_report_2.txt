  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a standard API client with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and a malware score of 0.\n- **Verification:** The code indeed appears to be a straightforward API wrapper with data models, endpoint definitions, and data handling routines. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** The malware score of 0 is justified. The overall security risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Verification:** The code remains a typical API client with data structures, endpoint definitions, and data encoding (base64) for images. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report states no signs of malware or malicious behavior, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Verification:** The code functions as a standard API client, with data retrieval, encoding, and notification configuration. No obfuscation or malicious logic is evident.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware score is justified as 0. Security risk is very low.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—no malicious activity, malware score of 0.\n- **Verification:** The code's structure and functions are typical for an API client. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** The malware score remains justified at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious behavior, malware score of 0.\n- **Verification:** The code is a standard API wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a typical API client with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected; all reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores of 0 across all reports are justified based on the code analysis.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions or unwarranted claims; all assessments are cautious and justified.\n- **Consistency:** The scores align with the code's behavior and the detailed reasoning.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (standard API client, minimal risk, mostly due to data handling, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, straightforward API client for a vulnerability scanner service. It performs expected functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendations:** No changes needed; scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
