{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and API endpoints for interacting with a vulnerability scanner service, managing projects, tasks, and results, including retrieval and updates.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from method parameters, API responses, environment variables (if used externally), and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (get, post, put, delete), base64 encoding, data returned from API calls, and internal data assignment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to API request construction, responses are processed and stored in object attributes, and binary data (images) can be base64-encoded for return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding in get_image_binary without explicit validation, but this is standard practice. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code detected. Notification functions are straightforward and do not contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a client library for a vulnerability scanner API. Classes encapsulate project, task, and result management, with methods to create, update, delete, and retrieve data. Endpoints are well-defined with parameters and wrappers. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious code constructs are present. Data is handled securely, with no evident data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. The use of base64 encoding for images is normal for binary data transmission. The notification functions create data structures for notifications and contain no code that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client library for a vulnerability scanner API, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs typical API interactions, data handling, and encoding without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
