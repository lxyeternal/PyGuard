  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for a vulnerability scanner service. It performs expected functions without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature."
