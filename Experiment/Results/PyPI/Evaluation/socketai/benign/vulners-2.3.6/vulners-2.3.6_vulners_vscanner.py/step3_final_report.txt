{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python API client for a vulnerability scanner service, providing data models, endpoint definitions, and utility functions for managing projects, tasks, results, and notifications.",
  "sources": "API response data, function parameters, configuration dictionaries, environment variables (if any), and data retrieved via network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints, base64 encoding of images, internal state updates, and data structures used for API payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into data model objects; user inputs or function arguments into API request parameters; responses processed and stored or returned by methods such as get_image_binary, create/update/delete functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client with data models and endpoint wrappers. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The get_image_binary method handles binary data appropriately, encoding it in base64 if requested. The notification helpers are simple configuration objects. No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and standard for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for a vulnerability scanner service. It performs expected functions without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature.",
