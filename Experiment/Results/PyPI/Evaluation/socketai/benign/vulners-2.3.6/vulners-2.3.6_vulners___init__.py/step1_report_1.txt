{
  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and set warnings filter for deprecation warnings",
  "sources": "Standard library 'warnings'; relative imports from local modules (.base, .vscanner, .vulners)",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only sets warning filter and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only import statements and warning configuration",
  "analysis": "This code performs simple import statements from local modules and sets a warnings filter for DeprecationWarning to always display. No user input handling, no external data reads, and no sensitive operations are present. The use of relative imports suggests modular code structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as setup or initialization with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
