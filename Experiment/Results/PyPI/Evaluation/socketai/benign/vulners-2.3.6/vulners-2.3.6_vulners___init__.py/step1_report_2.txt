{
  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and set warning filter for deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .vscanner, .vulners). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. No data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only performs imports and warning configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and sets a warning filter to always display deprecation warnings. It does not process or handle any user input or external data. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase and only manages imports and warning behavior, with no malicious or suspicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily handling imports and warning filters. No malicious intent, no security issues, and no obfuscation detected. It is typical setup code for a larger project.",
