  "purpose": "This script reads test duration data from a file and outputs the specified number of slowest tests.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a file specified by '--durations-path', which defaults to '.test_durations'.",
  "sinks": "Loads data using json.load() from the specified file; outputs results to standard output via print().",
  "flows": "Input: File specified by '--durations-path' -> json.load() -> processes durations -> outputs slowest tests with print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Usage of argparse and json is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility to parse a JSON-formatted durations file and print the slowest tests. It uses standard libraries and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for analyzing test durations. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
