  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured pytest plugin for test splitting based on durations. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (around 0.1) justified by the file handling nature but no actual malicious activity."
