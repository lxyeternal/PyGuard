{
  "purpose": "This code provides pytest plugin functionality for splitting test execution into groups based on durations or algorithms, storing and reading test durations, and managing test group splits.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options, reads test duration data from a JSON file, reads test reports during session finish.",
  "sinks": "Writes test duration data back to a JSON file.",
  "flows": "Reads durations at startup -> Collects and processes test reports -> Stores durations after test session.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration evident. Use of external libraries is typical for pytest plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pytest hooks and plugin classes for test splitting based on durations. It manages reading and writing JSON data for test durations. No malicious logic, network activity, or privacy violations are present. The code includes standard practices for plugin registration, configuration, and data handling. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only notable aspect is that it manages data storage and retrieval, which is typical for performance-based test splitting plugins.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical pytest plugin for test splitting and duration tracking. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely handles configuration, data storage, and test grouping logic.",
