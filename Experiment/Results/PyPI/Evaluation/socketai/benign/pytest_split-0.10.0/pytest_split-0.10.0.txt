Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0.3 could better represent the suspicion due to obfuscation. The current scores are consistent and appropriate given the evidence."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (around 0.1) justified by the file handling nature but no actual malicious activity."
