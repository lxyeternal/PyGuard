{
  "purpose": "The code ensures that IPython notebook cells are kept together in test groups, preventing tests from breaking up notebook cells.",
  "sources": "Reads 'group.selected', 'group.deselected', and 'item.nodeid'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data that lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads node IDs from group and items, processes them with helper functions, and modifies the group's selected/deselected lists based on notebook cell boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code uses string splits and list operations without dynamic code execution or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates test groupings based on IPython notebook cell boundaries, using string operations to identify notebook files and sibling cells. There are no external data sources, untrusted inputs, or insecure operations. It primarily manages internal data structures to preserve notebook integrity during testing. The functions perform straightforward string checks and list filtering, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for test organization related to IPython notebooks. It does not contain malware or security risks. It operates purely on internal data structures without external data processing. Overall, the code is safe and focused on test grouping logic.",
