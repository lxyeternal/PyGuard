{
  "purpose": "The code ensures compatibility of test groups with IPython notebooks by managing test selection and deselection based on notebook cell boundaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'group' object, including 'group.selected' and 'group.deselected', as well as 'items' list and 'nodeid' attributes. It also reads node IDs in helper functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code manipulates data structures without writing to external systems or executing untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "The code processes 'group.selected' and 'group.deselected' data, using helper functions to identify notebook cells and adjust selections accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code performs standard data filtering and list manipulation without obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for managing test groupings based on IPython notebook cell boundaries. It uses string splitting to identify notebook files and list operations to modify groupings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leaks, or security issues. The functions are straightforward and document their intent clearly. No external network calls, file writes, or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for handling IPython notebook test groupings. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages data structures based on notebook cell identifiers.",
