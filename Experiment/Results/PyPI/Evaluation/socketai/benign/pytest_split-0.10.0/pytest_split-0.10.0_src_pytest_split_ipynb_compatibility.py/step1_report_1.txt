{
  "purpose": "The code aims to ensure compatibility with IPython notebooks by managing test groupings and cell boundaries during testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'group.selected', 'group.deselected', 'item.nodeid', and 'node_id' values, primarily from function parameters and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies 'group.selected' and 'group.deselected' lists by appending or removing items based on notebook cell structure.",
  "flows": "The functions analyze node IDs to identify notebook cell boundaries and adjust test groupings accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on straightforward string operations and list manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs logical operations to manage test groupings for IPython notebooks, including splitting and merging test cells based on node IDs. There are no external data inputs beyond provided parameters, and no network or file operations are performed. The logic is safe, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing IPython notebook cell groupings during testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The functions serve well-defined purposes related to test organization without introducing any security concerns.",
