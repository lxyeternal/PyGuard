{
  "purpose": "The code ensures compatibility with IPython notebooks by managing test groups and their constituent test items, preventing the breaking up of notebook cells during test execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'group.selected', 'group.deselected', and 'item.nodeid' attributes, as well as splitting 'nodeid' strings to identify notebook files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present where untrusted data is used to perform critical actions such as executing code or accessing sensitive data. The code mainly manipulates internal data structures.",
  "flows": "The code flows from identifying if the group involves an IPython notebook, then finds sibling notebook cells, and modifies the group's selected and deselected items accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code uses standard string operations and list manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code functions to maintain test group integrity with respect to IPython notebooks. It checks node IDs to determine if files are notebooks, then adjusts groupings to prevent breaking up notebook cells. The functions involved are straightforward, primarily string operations and list filtering. No external inputs are used in potentially dangerous ways, and no insecure behaviors or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and purpose-driven to support IPython notebook testing. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious code or behavior. Overall, this code is safe.",
