{
  "purpose": "Manage test groupings to prevent splitting IPython notebook cells across different test groups by identifying notebook files and adjusting group selections accordingly.",
  "sources": "Node IDs of test items, specifically the 'nodeid' attribute in test items and group selected/deselected lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only manipulates internal lists based on string pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Node ID strings are checked for '.ipynb' extension to identify notebooks; group.selected and group.deselected are modified based on sibling cell detection.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in function name '_find_sibiling_ipynb_cells' (should be '_find_sibling_ipynb_cells'); no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string operations and list manipulations to manage test groupings for IPython notebooks. It does not perform any external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear and aligns with its purpose. The typo in the function name is a minor maintainability issue but does not affect security. The code's assumptions about node ID formats are standard and unlikely to introduce vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing test groupings related to IPython notebooks, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with its behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
