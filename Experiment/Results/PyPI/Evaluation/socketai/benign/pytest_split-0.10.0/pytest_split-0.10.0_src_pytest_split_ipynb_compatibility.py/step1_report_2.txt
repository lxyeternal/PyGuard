{
  "purpose": "The code manages and ensures compatibility of test groups with IPython notebook cells by identifying and handling partial notebook cell splits during test execution.",
  "sources": "Reads group.selected, group.deselected, and item.nodeid; processes node_id strings to determine notebook cell boundaries.",
  "sinks": "Uses string splitting and list comprehensions; no direct data sinks for untrusted input manipulation or external data output.",
  "flows": "Checks nodeid strings to identify notebook cells, modifies group.selected and group.deselected based on cell boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs string operations to identify notebook files (.ipynb) and manage test group membership accordingly. It manipulates internal data structures for test management. No external inputs other than function parameters are used, and there are no dynamic code executions or external communications. The functions are straightforward, focused on string pattern matching and list manipulations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for test grouping based on notebook cell boundaries. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. It simply processes file path strings to maintain test group integrity.",
