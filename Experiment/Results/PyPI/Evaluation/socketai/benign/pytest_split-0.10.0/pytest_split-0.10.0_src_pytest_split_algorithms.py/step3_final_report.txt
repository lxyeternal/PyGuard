{
  "purpose": "Provides test grouping algorithms for pytest, organizing test items based on durations or splitting into chunks.",
  "sources": "Test items and duration dictionary inputs, internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; internal processing only.",
  "flows": "Reads test items and durations, processes them through sorting and heap operations, outputs grouped test sets.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two test grouping algorithms: one based on durations using a heap to balance group durations, and another splitting the list into non-overlapping chunks. It uses standard Python data structures, sorting, and heapq operations. No external system calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and purely computational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It serves as a utility for test organization within pytest. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
