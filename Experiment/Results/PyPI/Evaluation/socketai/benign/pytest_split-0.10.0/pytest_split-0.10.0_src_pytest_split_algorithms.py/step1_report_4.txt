{
  "purpose": "The code provides two algorithms for splitting test items into groups based on their durations, intended for use with pytest to optimize test execution time.",
  "sources": "The code reads test items via parameters 'items' of type List[nodes.Item] and test durations from the 'durations' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are present. The code performs internal computations and returns structured data without data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Items and durations are processed through functions _get_items_with_durations, which combines data sources, then fed into algorithms that create groups, with no external untrusted data influence beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python modules, type annotations, and clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements algorithms for grouping test items based on duration data, with careful handling of item order and durations. It reads test items and durations, processes them to create balanced groups, and maintains internal state without external system effects. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network operations, file system access, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of standard libraries and lack of dynamic code execution or obfuscation suggest the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate implementation of test grouping algorithms for pytest, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward data processing and internal calculations. Overall security risk and malware probability are very low.",
