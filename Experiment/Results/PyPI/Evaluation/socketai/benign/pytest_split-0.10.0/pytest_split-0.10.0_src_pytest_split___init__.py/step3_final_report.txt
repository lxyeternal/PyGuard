  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from stdin, environment variables, external files, network sources.",
  "sinks": "Output to files, stdout, network connections, or other external systems that could leak data or be exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), potentially untrusted data reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, confusing variable names, or suspicious network activity. Notably, high obfuscation scores and signs of concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate most snippets are benign with no suspicious patterns, malware, or obfuscation. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious scoring. Malware scores are low (0–0.2), reflecting no confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are high (up to 0.7) only in Report 4, justified by the described obfuscation. Security risks are low (0.2–0.3), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities. The assessments are cautious but justified, with scores aligned to the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code snippets are benign with some obfuscation in one case. The scoring accurately reflects the analysis, with no major revisions needed. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0.3 could better represent the suspicion due to obfuscation. The current scores are consistent and appropriate given the evidence.",
