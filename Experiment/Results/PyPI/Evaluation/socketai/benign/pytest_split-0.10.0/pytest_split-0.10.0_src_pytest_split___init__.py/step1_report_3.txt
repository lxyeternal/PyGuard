  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands, depending on the actual code content, which is missing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or operations, but detailed flow analysis cannot be performed without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to absence of code; the structure and format appear normal, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs visible.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code content provided to analyze source-to-sink data flows, detect obfuscation, or identify malicious patterns. The review cannot be completed accurately without the actual code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code provided to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. Based on the absence of code, no malicious activity or security issues can be identified. Further analysis requires the actual code content.",
