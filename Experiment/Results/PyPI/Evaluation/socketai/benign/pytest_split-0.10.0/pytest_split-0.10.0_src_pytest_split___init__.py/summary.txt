  "conclusion": "Overall, the code snippets are benign with some obfuscation in one case. The scoring accurately reflects the analysis, with no major revisions needed. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0.3 could better represent the suspicion due to obfuscation. The current scores are consistent and appropriate given the evidence."
