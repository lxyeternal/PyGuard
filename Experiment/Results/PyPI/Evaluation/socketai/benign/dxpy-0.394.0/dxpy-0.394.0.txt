      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The only potential security concern is the use of exec on a local version file, which is acceptable if the file is controlled and verified. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the exec pattern. Overall, the script is safe for use in its current form."
