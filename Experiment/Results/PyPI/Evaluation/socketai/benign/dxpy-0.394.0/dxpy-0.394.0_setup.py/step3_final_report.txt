{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script for the dxpy library, handling version extraction, dependencies, scripts, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'dxpy/toolkit_version.py', reads README file, lists scripts and directories for package data, and environment variables for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external code execution beyond reading local files and directory listings.",
  "flows": "Reads version info via exec, loads dependencies and scripts from local files, and processes directory contents for package data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec to evaluate 'dxpy/toolkit_version.py' is a potential concern; typo in 'Readme.md' (likely intended as 'README.md') but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with standard patterns. The main point of caution is the use of exec to load version info, which could execute malicious code if the version file is compromised. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and relies on trusted local files, assuming the version file is secure. The use of exec is common but should be maintained with trusted files to prevent supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The only potential security concern is the use of exec on a local version file, which is acceptable if the file is controlled and verified. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the exec pattern. Overall, the script is safe for use in its current form.",
