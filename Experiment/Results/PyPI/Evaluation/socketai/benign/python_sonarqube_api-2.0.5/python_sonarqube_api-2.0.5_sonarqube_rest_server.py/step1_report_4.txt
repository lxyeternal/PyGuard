{
  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with a SonarQube server to retrieve its version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sonarqube.utils' modules; the decorator @GET applied to get_server_version method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The get_server_version method is decorated with @GET, which likely performs an HTTP GET request to API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code structures. The code is straightforward, utilizing imported modules for HTTP interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from RestClient, with a method decorated to perform an API GET request to retrieve server version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The imports suggest standard use of utility modules for REST API interaction. No input/output flows involving untrusted data are visible beyond typical API calls, which are standard and expected in such classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client class for SonarQube, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
