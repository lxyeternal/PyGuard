  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with SonarQube server API to get server version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sonarqube.utils for REST client, config, and GET decorator.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily sets up a class and method for API interaction.",
  "flows": "Method get_server_version calls the GET decorator, which invokes an API endpoint; data flows from API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT to the method execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard class inheritance, decorator, and method definitions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SonarQubeServer class inheriting from RestClient, with a method get_server_version decorated with GET to retrieve server version info from a specified endpoint. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. The structure appears standard for an API client. The code imports suggest it relies on external modules for REST calls, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an API client for SonarQube, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple API call to retrieve server version info without processing untrusted input or executing unsafe operations.",
