{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with a SonarQube server to retrieve its version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sonarqube.utils modules, particularly RestClient, API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT, and GET decorator.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows through the get_server_version method, which calls an API endpoint; however, no untrusted data input or sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The get_server_version method uses the GET decorator to invoke an API endpoint; data flows from the API endpoint to the caller, but there are no apparent malicious manipulations or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be straightforward API client code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility modules to create a client class for SonarQube server operations. The class inherits from RestClient and defines a method to retrieve server version info via a decorator-based GET request. There are no signs of malicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks. The structure is clean and typical for API client code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client wrapper for retrieving server version information from SonarQube. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
