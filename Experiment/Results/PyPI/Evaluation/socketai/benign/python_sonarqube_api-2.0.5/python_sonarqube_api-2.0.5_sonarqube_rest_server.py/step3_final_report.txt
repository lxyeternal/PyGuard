  "purpose": "API client class for retrieving SonarQube server version information via a REST API call.",
  "sources": "External modules: 'sonarqube.utils.rest_client', 'config', 'common'; the API endpoint specified by API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT.",
  "sinks": "The GET decorator triggers an HTTP request to the API endpoint; no untrusted data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "Method invocation leads to a GET request to the API endpoint, returning server version data.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple API client class inheriting from RestClient, with a method decorated to perform a GET request to a known endpoint. It relies on external, standard utility modules and performs no data processing or user input handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client for SonarQube with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
