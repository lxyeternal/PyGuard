{
  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with SonarQube server operations, specifically to get server version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from 'sonarqube.utils', specifically 'rest_client', 'config', and 'common'. The 'get_server_version' method calls an API endpoint defined by 'API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT'.",
  "sinks": "The method 'get_server_version' makes an API call to 'API_SERVER_VERSION_ENDPOINT'. This is the main data sink, but it appears to be a read operation for retrieving server version info.",
  "flows": "The class method flows from the invocation of 'get_server_version' to the API endpoint call, retrieving server version data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of 'RestClient' to interact with a SonarQube server. The method 'get_server_version' is decorated with '@GET' to perform an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint. The code is minimal and appears to follow standard practices. There are no suspicious operations, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials. The purpose is purely to fetch server version information, with no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and benign API client wrapper for retrieving SonarQube server version info. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
