  "purpose": "A Python class wrapping SonarQube user group API endpoints, providing methods to get, search, create, and update user groups.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'name', 'organization', 'description', and imported endpoint constants used in API call decorators.",
  "sinks": "API call functions (@GET, @POST) that send data to SonarQube endpoints; no untrusted data handling beyond parameter passing.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow directly into API request calls; no complex data processing or insecure data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client class for SonarQube user groups, utilizing decorators for HTTP methods and imported endpoint URLs. It performs typical REST operations without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. Input parameters are used directly in API calls, which is normal for such clients. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper for managing SonarQube user groups. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
