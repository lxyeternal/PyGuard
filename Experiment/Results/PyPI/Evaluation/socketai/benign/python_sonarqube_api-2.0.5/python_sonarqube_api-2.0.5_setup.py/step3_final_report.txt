  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, reading metadata and configuration details for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; reading 'sonarqube/__init__.py' to extract version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading version line from '__init__.py' and executing eval() on it; reading README content; passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on a line from '__init__.py' to parse version string, which is unsafe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but uses eval() to parse the version, which can execute arbitrary code if the source file is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscated code is present. The eval() usage introduces a security concern, but no malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The main recommendation is to replace eval() with a safer parsing method such as ast.literal_eval().",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and standard for a setup script, with the primary concern being the unsafe eval() usage. No malware or malicious behavior is present. The current security risk score is justified, but replacing eval() would improve security.",
