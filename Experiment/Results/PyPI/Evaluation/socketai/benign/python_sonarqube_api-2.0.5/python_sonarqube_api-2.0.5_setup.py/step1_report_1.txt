  "purpose": "The script is a setup module for packaging a Python project, specifically to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description; reads __init__.py file in sonarqube directory to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; no external sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from local files and assigns to variables; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on a line extracted from __init__.py to determine version number is potentially unsafe, as eval() can execute arbitrary code if the content of the line is maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file reading and package configuration tasks. The use of eval() on a version line is a security concern because eval() executes arbitrary code, which could be exploited if the __init__.py file contains malicious code. All other parts, including dependencies and package metadata, appear standard. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The eval() usage is the main anomaly and a potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script functions as expected for package configuration but includes the risky use of eval() for extracting the version number. This represents a moderate security concern, as malicious modifications to __init__.py could lead to code execution. No malware or malicious behavior is detected beyond this pattern.",
