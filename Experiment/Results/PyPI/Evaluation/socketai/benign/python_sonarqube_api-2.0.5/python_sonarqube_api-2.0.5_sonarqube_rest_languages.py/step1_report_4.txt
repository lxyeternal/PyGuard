{
  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with SonarQube language APIs to list supported programming languages.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the method parameter 'q' which accepts external input.",
  "sinks": "The decorator @GET and the REST client method that could send data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Input 'q' could be used in API calls via the GET decorator, which then interacts with external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of decorators and class methods is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility modules for REST client functionality and configuration, defines a class SonarQubeLanguages inheriting from RestClient, and a method get_supported_programming_languages decorated with @GET. This method lists supported languages with an optional pattern 'q'. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; it appears to be a straightforward API wrapper.\n\nThere are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious data exfiltration. The code relies on external modules, but their use here is standard for API interaction.\n\nThe code structure, including the decorator and method, is typical for API clients. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for SonarQube's language listing endpoint. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe.",
