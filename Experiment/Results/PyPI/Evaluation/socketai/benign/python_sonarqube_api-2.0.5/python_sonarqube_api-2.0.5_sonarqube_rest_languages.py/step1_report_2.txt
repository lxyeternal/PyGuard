{
  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with SonarQube language API endpoints to list supported programming languages.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from sonarqube.utils modules; method parameters (q).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data processing, output, or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameter q flows into the get_supported_programming_languages method; no further data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. Code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class SonarQubeLanguages extending RestClient, with a method decorated to perform an HTTP GET request to fetch supported programming languages from a specific API endpoint. The import statements suggest dependency on external modules for REST calls and configuration. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is typical for API client wrappers, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client wrapper for SonarQube's language listing endpoint. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
