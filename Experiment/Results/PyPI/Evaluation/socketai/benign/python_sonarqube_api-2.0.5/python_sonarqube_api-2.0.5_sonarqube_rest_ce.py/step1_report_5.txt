{
  "purpose": "Define a class for SonarQube Continuous Engineering (CE) operations, specifically for searching tasks via REST API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sonarqube.utils modules; method parameters; class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The @GET decorator likely executes an HTTP GET request to an external API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation -> method call -> decorator triggers -> HTTP request to API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific utility modules and defines a class inheriting from RestClient. It contains a method 'search_tasks' decorated with @GET, which calls an external API endpoint with various parameters. The parameters are documented but not used in an insecure or suspicious way. The code structure appears standard for an API client wrapper, with no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It relies on external utilities for request handling, and the core logic appears straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client class for SonarQube CE operations, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It is safe and functions as intended for interacting with the SonarQube API.",
