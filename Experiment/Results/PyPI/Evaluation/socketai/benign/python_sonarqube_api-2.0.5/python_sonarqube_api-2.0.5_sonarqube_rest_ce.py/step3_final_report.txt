  "purpose": "A simple API client wrapper for SonarQube's task search endpoint, facilitating parameterized API requests.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as component, componentId, maxExecutedAt, minSubmittedAt, onlyCurrents, p, ps, q, status, type.",
  "sinks": "The API request constructed with these parameters, sent to the endpoint specified by API_CE_ACTIVITY_ENDPOINT.",
  "flows": "Parameters received by search_tasks are directly included in the API request URL/query string, flowing from input to external API call.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical API client patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class SonarQubeCe inherits from RestClient and defines a method search_tasks decorated with @GET, which calls an external API endpoint with user-supplied parameters. No validation, sanitization, or encryption is performed on inputs, but this is standard for API wrappers. The code contains no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The parameters are passed directly into the API request, which could pose security considerations if the backend endpoint is vulnerable, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities. The overall structure is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The parameters are passed directly to the API endpoint, which is typical for such clients. The risk of malicious activity is negligible; the scores reflect minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
