  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a straightforward API client wrapper with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a simple class with a method decorated with @GET, calling an API endpoint with parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes the code as a standard API wrapper, with potential concern about passing untrusted parameters but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code accepts user input parameters and passes them into an API request. While this could be a concern if the API endpoint is vulnerable, the code itself does not perform any sanitization or malicious activity. The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly cautious but acceptable given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious code detected. The securityRisk score could be slightly higher if considering potential injection, but as per the code, it’s acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms the code as a standard API client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low securityRisk score aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes the code as a standard API wrapper, with parameters flowing into an API request, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The parameters are passed directly into the API request. While this could be risky if the backend is vulnerable, the code itself does not show malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirms no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the fact that the code accepts parameters that could be misused if the backend is vulnerable. Given the code snippet alone, this is a cautious but reasonable assessment.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The code is a standard API client wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The potential security concern lies in how the API endpoint handles untrusted parameters, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, based on potential misuse of parameters, but not a direct vulnerability.\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a typical API client wrapper with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware.",
