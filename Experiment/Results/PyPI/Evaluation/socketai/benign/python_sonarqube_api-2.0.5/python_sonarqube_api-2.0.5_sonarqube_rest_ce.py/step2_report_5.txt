  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a straightforward API client with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It correctly identifies the class, method, and usage of @GET decorator, and finds no suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — seems appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential flow of untrusted parameters into API calls. It notes no sanitization or validation but considers this typical for API wrappers.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — the securityRisk is slightly elevated due to passing unvalidated parameters, but without evidence of malicious intent, this seems reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is cautious but justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a standard API wrapper, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Well-reasoned and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that parameters are passed directly into API calls without sanitization but no malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation, describing the code as a standard API client.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are assigned based on the potential for unvalidated parameters to be misused, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are identified.\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard API client wrapper, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The parameters are passed into API calls but are not manipulated maliciously.\n\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if we consider the potential for misuse via unvalidated parameters, but given the context, these are reasonable.\n\n- No changes are necessary; the scores are aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to external parameters passing, but no actual vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, straightforward API client with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
