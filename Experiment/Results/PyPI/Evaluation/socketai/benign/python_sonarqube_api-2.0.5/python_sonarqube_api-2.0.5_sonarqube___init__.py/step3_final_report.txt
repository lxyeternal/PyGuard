{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup code importing classes from the 'sonarqube.rest' module, likely for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sonarqube.rest' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and metadata comments, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. It is a standard setup snippet for SonarQube API interaction. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns or data flows. The confidence level is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The confidence level is 1.0. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
