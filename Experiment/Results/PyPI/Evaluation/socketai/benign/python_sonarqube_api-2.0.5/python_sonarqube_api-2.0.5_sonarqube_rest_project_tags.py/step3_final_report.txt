  "purpose": "API client wrapper for SonarQube project tags search endpoint",
  "sources": "Parameters q, p, ps passed to the search_project_tags method",
  "sinks": "API call made via RestClient with parameters q, p, ps",
  "flows": "Input parameters q, p, ps flow into the API request via the decorator and method call",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API wrapper with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from RestClient, with a method decorated to perform a GET request to a specific endpoint. It accepts optional parameters for filtering. No untrusted data is processed internally; the code relies on external modules assumed to be secure. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
