  "purpose": "Define a class for interacting with SonarQube project tags API endpoint",
  "sources": "Import statements from sonarqube.utils modules, class method parameters",
  "sinks": "Potential HTTP request in the decorated method, usage of external API endpoint",
  "flows": "Method call to search_project_tags leads to API request via REST client",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from RestClient, with a method decorated to perform an API GET request to a specific endpoint. It appears to be a straightforward wrapper for a SonarQube API call. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No user input is directly processed beyond method parameters, and no data leakage, system modification, or network exfiltration activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign wrapper for SonarQube API interactions, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
