{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to search project tags in SonarQube via REST API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sonarqube.utils modules, specifically RestClient, config endpoint, and GET decorator.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks indicating vulnerability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from RestClient with a method decorated by GET, which calls an API endpoint to search tags. No dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling, and no external data manipulation observed. The code appears straightforward and aligned with normal API client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API wrapper for SonarQube project tags with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
