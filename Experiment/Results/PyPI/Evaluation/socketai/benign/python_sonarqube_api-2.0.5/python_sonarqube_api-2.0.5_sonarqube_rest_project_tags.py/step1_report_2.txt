  "purpose": "Define a class to interact with SonarQube project tags API for searching tags.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules and the class method parameters (q, p, ps).",
  "sinks": "The search_project_tags method may send requests to an external API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (q, p, ps) are passed to an API call, but the implementation details are not shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The class relies on imported modules for request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility modules and defines a class extending RestClient, with a method decorated to perform a GET request to a specific endpoint. The method is designed for searching tags with optional filters. No sensitive data handling, no obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is evident. The structure appears standard for API client wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client class for SonarQube, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external modules for network requests, and no sensitive data or backdoors are evident.",
