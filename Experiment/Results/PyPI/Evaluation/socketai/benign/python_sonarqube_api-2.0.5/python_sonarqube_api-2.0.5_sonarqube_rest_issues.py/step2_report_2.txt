  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a standard REST API client wrapper for SonarQube issues, with methods for searching and assigning issues.\n   - No embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - The code relies on external modules (`rest_client`, `config`, `common`) for network operations and configuration, which are not included here. Assuming these modules are secure, the code itself appears safe.\n   - The parameters are used to construct API requests; no evidence of code injection or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward API client.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The reports mention that untrusted input could flow into API calls, but this is typical for such clients; proper sanitization depends on external usage, not this code.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident within this code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue & Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks (~0.1-0.2). These are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9-1), which aligns with the thoroughness of the review.\n   - No adjustments needed; scores are consistent with the findings.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The low risk scores reflect the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities within this code snippet.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.\n   - The code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about external modules or the context in which this code is used.\n   - They correctly state that the security depends on external modules and usage, not this code alone.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n   - The overall assessment is that this code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** Approximately 0.2 (due to API exposure and parameter handling, but low overall)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, well-structured API client for SonarQube issues management. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code appears safe for supply chain purposes.",
