  "purpose": "A REST API client wrapper for SonarQube issues management, providing methods to search and assign issues via API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods 'search_issues' and 'issue_assign' which are used to construct API requests.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints that handle untrusted input parameters; no direct data leakage or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method calls into API request payloads, which are sent to SonarQube endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with methods decorated to interact with SonarQube's issue search and assignment endpoints. It relies on external modules for network communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The extensive parameter lists are typical for such API wrappers and do not indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or contain hidden logic. External dependencies' security is assumed but not verified here. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client for SonarQube issues management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
