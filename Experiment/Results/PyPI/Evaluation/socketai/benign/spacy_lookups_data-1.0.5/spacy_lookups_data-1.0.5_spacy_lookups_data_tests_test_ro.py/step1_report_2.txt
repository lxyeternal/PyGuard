  "purpose": "Unit testing for Romanian lemmatization functionality using pytest.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via pytest parametrize, notably the strings in the test cases.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external system interaction in the code.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow from test parameters into the ro_nlp function, with assertions checking the lemma output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest for unit testing and defines a parameterized test function that checks the lemmatizer output of a language processing pipeline 'ro_nlp'. The data includes Romanian words and their expected lemmas, and the function asserts that the pipeline produces the correct lemma for each string. There are no external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no unusual code behavior. The structure and content appear typical for a testing script. No malicious or suspicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest unit test script for linguistic processing. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and performs simple validation of lemmatization functionality.",
