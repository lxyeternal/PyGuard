  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward pytest unit test for Romanian NLP lemmatization, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is simple, standard testing code, with no malicious indicators. The scores seem appropriate.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a standard pytest test for lemmatization, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is benign, and the scores align with that.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard lemmatization test, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and appropriate.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard pytest testing of spaCy NLP pipeline, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe confidence is slightly less than 1, which is reasonable given the nature of the report, but the evidence strongly indicates benign code.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard test for lemmatization with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSimilar reasoning applies. The confidence is slightly lower, but the code remains benign.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- All reports describe benign, straightforward test code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware scores are all zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- The confidence scores are high, indicating strong certainty in benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0 for all reports (confirmed).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 for all reports (confirmed).  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.0 for all reports (confirmed).  \n- **Confidence:** Keep as is, as they reflect the certainty level.\n\n**Estimated overall scores for the dependency:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code in all reports is benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
