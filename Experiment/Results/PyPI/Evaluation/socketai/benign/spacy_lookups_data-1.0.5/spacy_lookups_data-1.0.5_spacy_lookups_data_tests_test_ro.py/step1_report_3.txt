  "purpose": "Unit testing for Romanian lemmatizer using pytest framework",
  "sources": "Input strings provided via parameterized test cases",
  "sinks": "Assertion checking the lemma of tokens; no untrusted data sink identified",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through ro_nlp tokenization and lemma assignment, then checked by assertion",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest unit test, utilizing parameterization for multiple test cases. It tests the output of an NLP model (ro_nlp) on various Romanian words to verify correct lemmatization. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on external NLP library for tokenization and lemmatization, which is typical for such tests. No suspicious activities, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for a lemmatization function. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
