{
  "purpose": "Load JSON data files for various language-specific lexical resources based on the runtime Python version.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource files from the package data directory using get_file(), which calls either pkg_resources or importlib.resources depending on the Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; file paths are constructed using fixed filenames and package data, with no external input involved.",
  "flows": "get_file() determines file paths based on fixed filenames, and these are stored in dictionaries for later use; no dynamic execution or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies solely on standard library functions for resource file access. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports resource management modules depending on the Python version, then defines a function to retrieve file paths for package data resources. It subsequently creates multiple dictionaries for different languages, each mapping resource names to their respective file paths. All resource file names are hardcoded and fixed, indicating static resource management. No user input, network operations, or code execution based on untrusted data is present. The logic is straightforward and utilizes standard, safe library functions for resource access.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign resource loader for language-specific JSON files. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation relies on well-known standard library functions for reading package data, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
