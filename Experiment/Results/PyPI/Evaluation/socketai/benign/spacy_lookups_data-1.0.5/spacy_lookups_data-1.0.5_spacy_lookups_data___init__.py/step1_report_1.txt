{
  "purpose": "The code loads various language-specific JSON data files for use in linguistic processing within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data files from package resources using get_file(), which depends on the Python version. The sources are the resource files within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted user input or perform data leaks. No network, file write, or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves file paths through get_file() for each language dataset, which are then stored in dictionaries. No further data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports for different Python versions but no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically loads language data files via get_file(), which adapts based on Python version to locate resources within the package. The dictionaries store paths to JSON files used for linguistic processing. There are no network calls, user inputs, or system commands. The logic is straightforward and focused on resource path retrieval. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely to load resource files into memory for further use, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for resource management within a Python package.",
