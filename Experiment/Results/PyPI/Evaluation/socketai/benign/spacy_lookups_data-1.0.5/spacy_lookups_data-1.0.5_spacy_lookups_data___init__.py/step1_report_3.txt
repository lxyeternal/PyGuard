  "purpose": "Load various linguistic resource files for different languages from package data.",
  "sources": "get_file() function, sys.version_info, __name__ in resource loading",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted input or external output is performed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; resource files are loaded internally",
  "anomalies": "Code uses dynamic import methods based on Python version, but no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are present. The resource filenames and usage are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a function get_file() that retrieves resource filenames from package data, adapting to Python version differences. It then constructs multiple dictionaries, each mapping resource keys to filenames obtained via get_file(). There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of user input or environment variables that could be exploited. The resource files appear to be static JSON data files. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource loader for language data files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages internal data files required for the application.",
