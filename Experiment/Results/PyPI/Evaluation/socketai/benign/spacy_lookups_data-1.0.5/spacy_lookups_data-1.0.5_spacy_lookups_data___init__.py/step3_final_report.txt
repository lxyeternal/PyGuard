  "purpose": "Load language-specific JSON resource files from within the package, adapting to Python version differences.",
  "sources": "Resource filenames are hardcoded strings used in get_file() calls, which retrieve file paths within the package.",
  "sinks": "The code only retrieves file paths; no data processing, user input, or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "get_file() is called for each resource filename, returning static file paths; no data flows beyond path retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports resource management modules based on Python version, then defines dictionaries mapping language codes to resource file paths. It performs static resource path retrieval without executing or processing data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The resource filenames are static and hardcoded, and the code uses standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource loader for language data files, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
