  "purpose": "A pytest unit test verifying that the Turkish lemmatizer correctly assigns lemmas to input strings.",
  "sources": "The input strings in the parameterized test data, and the external NLP pipeline 'tr_nlp' processing the strings.",
  "sinks": "Access to 'tokens[0].lemma_' attribute, which is a data point, not a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by 'tr_nlp', resulting in tokens; the test asserts the lemma of the first token.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest test function that inputs specific Turkish words into an NLP pipeline and asserts the lemma. It relies on external NLP processing, which is standard and does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The 'lemma_' attribute is a benign data point. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependency processing untrusted data, but in the context of a test, this is acceptable. The malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature. The security risk score could be set to zero, as no real security threat exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest unit test for Turkish lemmatization, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.",
