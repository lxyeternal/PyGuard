{
  "purpose": "The code defines a pytest unit test to verify the lemmatization of Turkish words using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data strings from the parameterized test inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by 'tr_nlp' to generate tokens, then the lemma of the first token is asserted against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard testing practices. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a parameterized test function. It processes Turkish words through an NLP pipeline (tr_nlp) to verify their lemmatized forms. The test checks that the first token's lemma matches expected values. There are no external data manipulations, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The structure appears normal for a unit test for language processing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test script for verifying NLP lemmatization functionality. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and intentionally designed for testing purposes.",
