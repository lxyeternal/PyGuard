  "purpose": "Unit test for Turkish lemmatizer lookup functionality using pytest framework.",
  "sources": "pytest.mark.parametrize decorator providing test data; tr_nlp function used to process input strings.",
  "sinks": "assert statement comparing token lemma; no external data sinks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> tr_nlp processing -> tokens -> lemma_ attribute -> assert comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a parameterized test function using pytest, passing various Turkish words and expected lemmas. It processes each string with tr_nlp, then asserts that the first token's lemma matches the expected value. All operations are standard testing procedures, relying on external NLP processing via tr_nlp. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. The code appears to be a straightforward test case for a lemmatizer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest unit test for a Turkish lemmatizer. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware detected.",
