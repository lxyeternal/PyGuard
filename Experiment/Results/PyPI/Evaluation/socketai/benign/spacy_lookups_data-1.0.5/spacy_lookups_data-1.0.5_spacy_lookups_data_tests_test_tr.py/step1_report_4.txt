{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test function for a Turkish language lemmatizer, verifying that certain input strings are correctly lemmatized to expected lemmas.",
  "sources": "Input strings in the parameterized test data, such as 'evlerimizdeki', 'işlerimizi', etc.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking the lemma attribute of tokens, which are derived from the 'tr_nlp' language processing pipeline.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> 'tr_nlp' processing -> tokens -> assertion on 'lemma_' attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard pytest parameterization. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test function decorated with pytest to verify lemmatization. It relies on an external NLP pipeline 'tr_nlp' to process Turkish strings. The test checks that the first token's lemma matches the expected value. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a language processing component with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
