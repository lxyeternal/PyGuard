  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string without additional code or logic; no suspicious or unusual code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version assignment statement, which is common in Python modules to specify the package version. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. No obfuscated or malicious code behaviors are present. The simplicity suggests it is a standard version declaration, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
