  "purpose": "Define the version string for the module or package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string assignment with no additional context or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '1.0.5' to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for versioning Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code is minimal and standard for package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
