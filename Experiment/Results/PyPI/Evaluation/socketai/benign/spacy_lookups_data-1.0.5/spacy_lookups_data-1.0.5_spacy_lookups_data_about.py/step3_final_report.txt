  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version string assignment in Python. It contains no input/output, no external data handling, no obfuscated or suspicious code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with full confidence (score 1). No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
