  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.0.5\"`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, output sinks, or complex logic.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, minimal, and contains no obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as hidden payloads, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are identified; the code is correct and typical for its purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n   - The code's purpose is purely declarative, with no external interactions or complex logic.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this is a typical version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
