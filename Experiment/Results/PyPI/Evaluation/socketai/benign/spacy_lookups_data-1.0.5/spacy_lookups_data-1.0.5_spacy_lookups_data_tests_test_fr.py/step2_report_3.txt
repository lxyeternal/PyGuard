  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The provided code is a set of pytest test functions for French lemmatization. The code itself appears syntactically correct and typical for such tests. There are no indications of malicious code or suspicious activity.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details. This suggests that the reports did not produce any meaningful analysis, vulnerabilities, or issues to evaluate.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports are essentially empty and do not contain any reasoning or findings.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   Since the reports are empty, there are no scores assigned or justifications provided. No adjustments are necessary based on the absence of information.\n\n4. **Risk and malware scores justification:**  \n   - Without any concrete findings, the risk score should be minimal, likely close to 0.  \n   - The malware score should also be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.  \n   - The \"Empty response\" errors do not suggest any malicious intent or vulnerabilities; they indicate a failure in reporting or analysis, not an issue in the code or dependency.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   Since the reports do not provide any claims or analysis, there are no assumptions to challenge.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The reports are empty, so assigning any high scores would be unreasonable. The scores should reflect the lack of findings.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected or claimed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no issues reported)  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The code appears benign, and the reporting failure is likely a technical issue rather than an indication of a problem.\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nMaintain a conservative score of zero across all categories given the lack of evidence. No further action needed unless new information emerges.",
