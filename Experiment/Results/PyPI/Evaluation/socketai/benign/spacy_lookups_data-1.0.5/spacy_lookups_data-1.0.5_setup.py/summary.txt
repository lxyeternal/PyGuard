  "conclusion": "The script is benign and performs typical setup tasks. The main security consideration is the use of exec() on an external file, which could be exploited if 'about.py' is malicious. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to this pattern, but in a trusted environment, the risk is minimal."
