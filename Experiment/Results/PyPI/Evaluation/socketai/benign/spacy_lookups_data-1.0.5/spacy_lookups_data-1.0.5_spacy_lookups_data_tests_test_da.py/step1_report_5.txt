{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests designed to verify the behavior of a Danish language processing pipeline, specifically testing lemmatization and normalization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameters in the parametrize decorators, which supply test strings for the language processing functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data processing or external communication; the code simply performs assertions on the output of da_nlp function.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input strings through the da_nlp processing function, and the results are checked against expected lemma and norm values; no external or untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard pytest features and straightforward assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of parameterized tests verifying that the language processing model 'da_nlp' correctly assigns lemmas and normalizations for specific Danish words. It imports pytest and uses parametrize to supply test data, then runs assertions on the output tokens. There are no indications of malicious code, external network calls, or data leaks. The tests are typical for validating NLP models and do not contain suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for NLP model validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a correctness check for language processing outputs.",
