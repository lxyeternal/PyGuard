{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests using pytest to verify the behavior of a Danish natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, specifically testing lemmatization and normalization functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'string' and 'text' parameters provided to the test functions, which are passed to the 'da_nlp' NLP pipeline for tokenization and processing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or outputs that transmit untrusted data externally; it only performs assertions within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through 'da_nlp' to generate tokens; the tests then verify specific token attributes ('lemma_' and 'norm_') against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward test code, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parameterized pytest functions to test lemmatization and normalization of Danish words using a natural language processing pipeline. It uses standard pytest features and asserts expected token attributes. There are no external data transmissions, no code injection, or any other malicious activities. The code appears to be standard testing routines for NLP model validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for NLP model validation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
