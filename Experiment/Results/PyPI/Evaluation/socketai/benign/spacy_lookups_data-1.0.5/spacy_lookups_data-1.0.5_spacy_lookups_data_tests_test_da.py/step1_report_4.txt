{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions using pytest to verify linguistic processing (lemmatization and normalization) of Danish text using an NLP model.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameterized test cases, specifically the 'string' and 'text' variables.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes data locally within the test functions; there are no explicit sinks like network calls, file writes, or database access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('string', 'text') into the 'da_nlp' NLP processing function, with outputs checked against expected 'lemma' and 'norm' values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard pytest-based testing of an NLP library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two parameterized test functions that invoke 'da_nlp' with specific Danish words, then assert that the resulting token attributes ('lemma_' and 'norm_') match expected values. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard test code verifying language processing functions, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for an NLP library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It reads input data from test parameters, processes it with a provided NLP model, and verifies outputs. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
