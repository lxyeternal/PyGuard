{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test natural language processing (NLP) functions for Danish language lemmatization and normalization, ensuring correct output for specific input strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings in parameterized test cases ('string', 'text') provided to the 'da_nlp' function, which likely processes Danish text.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that check the output attributes ('lemma_' and 'norm_') of the tokens produced by 'da_nlp', used for verifying correct NLP behavior.",
  "flows": "Input strings → 'da_nlp' function processing → token attributes ('lemma_', 'norm_') → assertions in tests",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code follows standard pytest testing patterns with clear parameterization. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parameterized pytest test functions to verify NLP processing accuracy. It imports 'pytest' and uses test functions with specific input data and expected output attributes. The 'da_nlp' object appears to be a language processing pipeline, likely from a library such as spaCy, although its implementation is not shown. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The tests serve to validate language-specific lemmatization and normalization features. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flow are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of pytest test cases for language processing validation. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
