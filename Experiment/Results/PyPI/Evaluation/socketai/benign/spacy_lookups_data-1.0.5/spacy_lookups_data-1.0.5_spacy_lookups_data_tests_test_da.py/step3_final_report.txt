{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests for a Danish NLP pipeline (`da_nlp`), specifically testing lemmatization and normalization functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for testing the NLP pipeline and processes them through `da_nlp` to obtain tokens.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; it only performs assertions on token attributes.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed via `da_nlp`, and the resulting tokens' attributes (`lemma_`, `norm_`) are checked against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing NLP outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of pytest tests verifying language processing outputs. No suspicious patterns, external data handling, or malicious activities are detected. The code's purpose is validation, and it operates solely on local data. The `da_nlp` object is assumed to be a legitimate NLP pipeline, likely from a trusted library. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure and content are clear, and the tests are standard for NLP validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a Danish NLP pipeline with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
