  "purpose": "Unit testing of an NLP lemmatizer function to verify its output on a sample string",
  "sources": "Input string 'abati inferi zurliniani' passed to 'it_lookup_nlp' function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output beyond assertions",
  "flows": "Input string -> it_lookup_nlp -> tokens -> lemma_ assertions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple unit test using pytest to check the lemmatization output of an NLP pipeline. It inputs a fixed string and asserts expected lemmas. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code does not involve network operations, data exfiltration, or credential handling. It appears to be a benign test case for NLP functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It operates solely within a testing environment to verify NLP output.",
