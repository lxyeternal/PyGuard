  "purpose": "Unit test for lemmatization functionality using the 'pytest' framework",
  "sources": "Input string 'abati inferi zurliniani' passed to 'it_lookup_nlp' function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; assertions check lemmatized output within test framework",
  "flows": "Input string -> it_lookup_nlp -> lemmatization -> assertion checks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; the function 'it_lookup_nlp' is assumed to be a normal NLP processing function",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pytest' and defines a test function 'test_it_lemmatizer' which applies NLP processing to a sample string. It checks the lemma output of tokens to verify correct lemmatization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward, intended for testing lemmatization, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for an NLP pipeline. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain compromise, or security risks. It appears safe and functional as intended.",
