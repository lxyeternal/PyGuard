  "purpose": "Unit testing for the lemmatizer functionality of a natural language processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "Input string \"abati inferi zurliniani\" passed to it_lookup_nlp function.",
  "sinks": "Assertion statements comparing tokens' lemma_ attributes; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> it_lookup_nlp -> tokens with lemma_ attributes; assertions verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest for testing. Defines a single test function that processes an Italian phrase through it_lookup_nlp, presumably a language processing model. It asserts that the lemmatized tokens match expected Italian lemmas. No data leaks, network calls, or malicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward, with standard testing assertions and no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for NLP lemmatization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally written for validation purposes.",
