{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function for a Croatian language lemmatizer, verifying that specific input strings are correctly lemmatized.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings via parameterized test cases (the 'string' variables).",
  "sinks": "The code accesses the 'lemma_' attribute of tokens, but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to the lemmatizer (hr_nlp), and their resulting tokens' lemmas are checked against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, no network connections, or suspicious data handling. The code appears straightforward as a unit test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a parameterized test for a lemmatizer, verifying that specific Croatian words are lemmatized to expected base forms. It uses standard pytest features with no hidden or obfuscated code. There are no network calls, no data leaks, no credential usage, and no suspicious logic. The code functions purely as a unit test for a natural language processing component, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard unit test for a language processing module with no signs of malware or security risks.",
