  "purpose": "Unit testing for a Croatian language lemmatizer component using pytest.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided via parameterized test data.",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement checking tokens[0].lemma_ for correctness.",
  "flows": "Input string -> hr_nlp processing -> tokens[0].lemma_ comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and uses parameterized testing to verify lemmatizer output. The test calls hr_nlp with input strings, retrieves the first token, and asserts its lemma matches expected values. No dynamic code execution, external data retrieval, or potentially malicious operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test for a natural language processing component. Usage of pytest.mark.parametrize is standard for such tests. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for a language processing module with no malicious behavior detected. It simply validates that the lemmatizer produces expected outputs for given input strings.",
