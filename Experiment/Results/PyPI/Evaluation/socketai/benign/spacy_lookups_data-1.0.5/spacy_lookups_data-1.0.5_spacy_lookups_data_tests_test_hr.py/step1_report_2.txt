  "purpose": "Unit testing for Croatian language lemmatization functionality using pytest.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided via pytest parameterization for lemmatization.",
  "sinks": "Assertion checks; no data sinks that pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by hr_nlp, then their lemma_ attributes are checked against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest-based unit test. It uses parameterization to test multiple input-output pairs for a Croatian NLP lemmatizer. The code does not contain any network calls, system modifications, or other malicious behaviors. It relies on the 'hr_nlp' object, which appears to be an NLP pipeline, but this is standard in testing NLP modules. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports, and no obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a language processing function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
