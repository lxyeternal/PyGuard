  "purpose": "Unit test for Croatian lemmatizer (`hr_nlp`) verifying correct lemmatization of specific words.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to `hr_nlp` function within the test parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs in-memory assertions.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> `hr_nlp` processing -> first token's `lemma_` attribute -> assertion check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no obfuscation, external calls, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, parameterized pytest unit test that processes Croatian words through an NLP pipeline and asserts expected lemmas. It involves no network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The code's purpose is solely to verify lemmatization correctness, and there are no suspicious signals or vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for a language processing component. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
