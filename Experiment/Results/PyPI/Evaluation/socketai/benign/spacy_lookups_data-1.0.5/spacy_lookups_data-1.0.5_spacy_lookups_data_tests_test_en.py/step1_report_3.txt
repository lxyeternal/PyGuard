{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for spaCy NLP library, specifically testing lemmatization and token normalization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data from string literals and the Doc object creation using spaCy's vocabulary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only performs assertions on processed tokens.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through spaCy pipeline components; no data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; code is standard test code for NLP processing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard pytest functions and spaCy library methods to test linguistic features such as lemmatization and token normalization. It creates Doc objects and retrieves pipeline components like the lemmatizer, then verifies output correctness. There are no indications of malicious activity, external data handling, or obfuscated code. The code only performs expected linguistic tests with predefined inputs and assertions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of unit tests for the spaCy NLP library focusing on linguistic features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. It is safe for use and has no security concerns.",
