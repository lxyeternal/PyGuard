{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the spaCy NLP library, specifically testing lemmatization and token normalization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded strings such as 'faster', 'fastest', 'better', 'best', 'dry', 'spun', 'spun-dry', 'singing', \"I'm\", and \"shan't\".",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only processes hardcoded test strings and performs assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the test input strings through spaCy NLP pipeline components (tokenization, lemmatization, normalization) with no external or untrusted data sources; results are validated against expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code behavior, or suspicious operations detected. Usage is standard for NLP testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that utilize the spaCy library to process predefined strings and verify linguistic features. It does not perform any network operations, data storage, or dynamic code execution. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior present. It appears to be standard unit testing code for NLP functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign unit tests for spaCy's NLP components, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely verifies expected language processing behaviors using static, hardcoded inputs.",
