{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for spaCy NLP lemmatizer and tokenizer functionalities using pytest framework.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input strings (e.g., text variables, word lists) to process and generate tokens.",
  "sinks": "Uses spaCy's NLP pipeline components such as lemmatizer and tokenizer, which do not perform unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input strings are tokenized and lemmatized; data flows from test inputs through spaCy components to assertions, without any external or untrusted data flow beyond controlled test data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard test code using publicly available libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests with pytest and spaCy's NLP components to verify lemmatization and tokenization behavior. No data is transmitted externally, nor does it perform any unsafe operations. Usage of test parameters, creation of Doc objects, and calling of pipeline components are typical for testing spaCy functionality. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code is straightforward and safe, serving purely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for spaCy NLP pipeline components with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
