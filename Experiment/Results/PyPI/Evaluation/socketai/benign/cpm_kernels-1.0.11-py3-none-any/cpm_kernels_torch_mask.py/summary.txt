  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of CUDA-accelerated masking functions in PyTorch. No malicious or obfuscated elements are detected. The reliance on an external CUDA kernel is typical but warrants verification in a security-sensitive context. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1)."
