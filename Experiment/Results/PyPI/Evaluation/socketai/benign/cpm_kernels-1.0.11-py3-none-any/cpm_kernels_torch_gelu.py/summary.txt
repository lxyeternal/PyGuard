  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, optimized implementation of GeLU activation functions for CUDA, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reliance on external CUDA kernels is typical in high-performance deep learning code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious awareness of external kernel trust but not indicating malicious activity."
