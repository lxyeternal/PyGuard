  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom . import library\nfrom .kernels import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Importing local modules; benign.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Importing local modules; use of `import *` is noted as potentially risky.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.7, malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The use of `import *` can hide imported names, which might be problematic, but in isolation, no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to `import *`, which is justified.\n- **Score adjustment:** Possibly increase confidence slightly to 0.8, but 0.7 remains reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Standard relative imports; benign.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.8, malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Import statements are standard; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence 1.0, malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The confidence is high given the simplicity.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. Slightly cautious due to relative import, but no actual malicious behavior.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, justified by the absence of external data handling or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The only notable concern is the use of `import *` in report 2, which warrants a slightly higher security risk score, but overall, all scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk due to `import *` but no actual threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with standard import statements in a package. No malicious or obfuscated activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe based on the provided snippets.",
