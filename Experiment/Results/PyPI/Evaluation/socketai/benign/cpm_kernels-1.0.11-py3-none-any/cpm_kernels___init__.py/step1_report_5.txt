{
  "purpose": "Importing modules and components within a package, likely for internal use or further functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from the same package directory (relative imports), specifically the 'library' module and everything from 'kernels'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows or external data input points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical for internal package structure; no suspicious code patterns or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements: one importing a module named 'library' from the current package, and another importing all names from the 'kernels' module within the same package. There is no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. The code appears to be standard package import statements, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal nature of this snippet suggests it is just setup code for a larger module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.",
