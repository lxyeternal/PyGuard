{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules or components from the same package or directory, likely for use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statements are the sources, as they bring in other modules or parts of the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet where untrusted data could be processed or lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing modules; no data processing or transmission is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two import statements, importing a local module 'library' and everything from 'kernels'. These are standard Python import statements with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No external input is read, and no data is transmitted. The snippet is likely part of a larger codebase but on its own shows no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious features. It does not pose a security risk in its current form.",
