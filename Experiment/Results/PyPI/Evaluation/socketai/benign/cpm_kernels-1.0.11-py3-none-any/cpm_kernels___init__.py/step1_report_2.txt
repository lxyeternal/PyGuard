{
  "purpose": "The code imports a local module named 'library' and all contents from a module named 'kernels'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules 'library' and 'kernels'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or network operations are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident, as these are just import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' from 'kernels' can be considered unusual or potentially risky, as it can hide imported functions and variables, making the code less clear and potentially importing malicious or unintended functions if the source module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of two import statements. It imports a local module named 'library' and all contents from a module named 'kernels'. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern because it can import hidden or unintended functions or variables, which can sometimes be malicious or problematic. However, in isolation, these are just standard import statements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in these lines. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code does not execute anything malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and consists solely of import statements, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' warrants slight caution, but it does not indicate malicious behavior by itself. Overall, the code appears benign.",
