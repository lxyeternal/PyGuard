{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports within a package, importing a module named 'library' and all contents from 'kernels'. It is likely used for internal module organization within a larger package.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves are the sources; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .kernels import *' can be considered a minor concern due to potential namespace pollution, but it is a common pattern in package initialization. No malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of internal relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is present. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but does not inherently introduce security risks unless the imported module is malicious. The overall structure is benign, and the import statements serve typical package organization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The import statements are standard for package setup, and no external data or network interactions are involved. The minimal security risk and malware scores are appropriate, with a very low risk score reflecting the minor concern about 'import *'.",
