{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules or components from within a package, possibly for internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules or components internally within the package",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being output or sent over a network",
  "flows": "N/A; only imports are present, no data flow or external data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical in package code but offers limited context; no suspicious or malicious activity evident in the import statements alone",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements: one imports a module named 'library' from the current package, and the other imports everything from a module named 'kernels' within the package. These are standard import practices in Python packages. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is visible. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger module or package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are apparent from these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and consists of internal import statements, which do not pose security risks or malicious intent. There is no indication of malware, data leakage, or malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for Python package structure.",
