  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard instruction class used in bytecode or VM implementations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to byte handling but does not indicate actual threat."
