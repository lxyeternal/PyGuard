{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library called evmdasm, related to Ethereum bytecode disassembly.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and uses setuptools to gather package information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only reads local files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic; the code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads a local README file for the long description and sets up package metadata. No user input, network activity, or external commands are executed. The package information appears standard and does not contain malicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package setup file with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration for an Ethereum disassembler library.",
