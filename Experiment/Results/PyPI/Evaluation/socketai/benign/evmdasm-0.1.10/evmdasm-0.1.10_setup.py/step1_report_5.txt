{
  "purpose": "The script defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'evmdasm', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and setuptools; the read() function reading 'README.md'; setup() call with various parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks for data leaks or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to reading a file ('README.md') and passing static parameters to setup(), with no data from untrusted sources flowing into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The setup script is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project. It imports necessary modules, defines a function to read files, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. The only dynamic element is reading 'README.md' if it exists. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no external code execution or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
