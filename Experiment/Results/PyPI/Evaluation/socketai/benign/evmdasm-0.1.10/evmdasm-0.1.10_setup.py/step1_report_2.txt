{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'evmdasm' Python package, used for installing and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, package metadata like name, version, author, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands; all data flows are from static sources to setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> setup configuration parameters (name, version, description, etc.) -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard setup.py script with no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The 'install_requires' list is empty, which may be a configuration oversight but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only necessary modules ('os' and 'setuptools'), reads a local README file if available, and defines package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, and URLs. There are no dynamic or external data inputs that could be manipulated. The code follows standard Python packaging practices and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward and benign setup script used for package distribution. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data flows, and no security concerns within this code fragment.",
