The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 due to the absence of security issues. The typo should be corrected for proper module functionality but does not impact security."

Consequently, the overall security risk and malware likelihood are negligible, and scores should be set to the lowest levels."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to byte handling but does not indicate actual threat."

The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with its function as a utility module."

The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the inherent risk of instruction sets if misused, but not maliciously crafted."
