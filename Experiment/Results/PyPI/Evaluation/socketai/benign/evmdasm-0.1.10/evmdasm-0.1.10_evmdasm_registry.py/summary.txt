  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static instruction registry for a VM or smart contract platform, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the inherent risk of instruction sets if misused, but not maliciously crafted."
