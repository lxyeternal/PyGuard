  "purpose": "Utility classes for disassembling, assembling, and manipulating Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, enabling analysis and modification of smart contract bytecode.",
  "sources": "Input bytecode provided to EvmBytecode for normalization; bytecode streams read during disassembly; instruction objects read and manipulated within EvmInstructions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data flows within instruction processing and reassembly, but no untrusted external data is sent or stored outside the module.",
  "flows": "Bytecode input -> normalization -> disassembly (instruction streams) -> instruction manipulation -> reassembly -> output bytecode.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flows detected. External modules (.registry, .utils) are not provided but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard EVM bytecode processing with classes for disassembly, instruction management, and assembly. It performs input normalization, instruction lookup, address fixing, and reassembly. No network activity, external system calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, with proper handling of instruction streams and addresses. External dependencies are not shown but are not suspicious based on the code provided. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Ethereum bytecode analysis and manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with its function as a utility module.",
