{
  "purpose": "This script provides command-line utilities for disassembling and listing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode instructions, primarily for analysis and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments, standard input, and files specified via command-line options.",
  "sinks": "The code reads files and standard input; it does not write untrusted data elsewhere. No direct data leaks or external network communications are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs or file contents are loaded into variables, then processed by the EvmBytecode disassembler; no external data or network flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs typical command-line argument parsing, file handling, and logging. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules for disassembly and registry, sets up logging, and parses command-line options. It lists instructions or disassembles provided bytecode, reading input from stdin, files, or arguments. All input sources are handled via safe file and input reading functions. No dangerous operations, such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration, are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for EVM bytecode analysis, with proper input validation and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard command-line tool for EVM bytecode disassembly and instruction listing. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. No security risks or malicious signals are evident. The code is well-structured, and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
