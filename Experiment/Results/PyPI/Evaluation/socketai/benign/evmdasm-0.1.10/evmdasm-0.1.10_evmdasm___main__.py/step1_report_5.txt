{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for disassembling and listing instructions from EVM bytecode, mainly for analysis and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments and optionally from stdin when piped; file reading occurs when input arguments are file paths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed disassembly and instruction lists; no untrusted data directly leads to system effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input from args or stdin flows into EvmBytecode for disassembly, then results are printed; no external or untrusted data reaches system calls or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard libraries and well-known patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for EVM bytecode disassembly. It reads inputs from command-line args or stdin, processes them through imported classes (EvmBytecode, registry), and outputs results. No obfuscated code, external network activity, or malicious patterns are evident. Usage of 'logger' and command-line parsing is standard. The code's structure is typical for such tools, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate disassembler utility without malicious intent. It safely handles input and output, with no evidence of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. It carries no significant security risks.",
