  "purpose": "A command-line utility for listing EVM instructions and disassembling bytecode, reading input from files, stdin, or command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line args, stdin, or files using open/read functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs disassembly or instruction list to stdout; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from stdin/files/args into EvmBytecode for disassembly, then output is printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI tool that imports core modules for disassembly, handles input safely, and outputs results. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. Input handling is typical for such utilities, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The error handling and logging are standard, and the code's structure is clear and maintainable. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe command-line utility for EVM bytecode analysis. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the security risk is minimal. The reports' assessments are accurate and aligned with the code's behavior.",
