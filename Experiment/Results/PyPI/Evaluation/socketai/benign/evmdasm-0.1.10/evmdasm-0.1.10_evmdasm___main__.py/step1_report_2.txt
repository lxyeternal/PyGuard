  "purpose": "Command-line utility for disassembling and listing instructions for Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from command-line arguments, standard input, and files specified via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdin.read() for input data, file reading for input files, and outputs to stdout; no untrusted data directly used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from stdin or files, then passed to EvmBytecode for disassembly; output is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected; logging configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes logging, parses command-line options, and conditionally executes listing or disassembly functions. It reads input data either from stdin or files, then processes it with the EvmBytecode class. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The only potentially risky operation is reading untrusted input data for disassembly, but it is handled locally without external communication. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility for disassembling Ethereum bytecode, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses standard practices for input handling and output. No malware or security risks identified.",
