  "purpose": "This script provides command-line functionality to list Ethereum Virtual Machine instructions and disassemble bytecode, primarily for analysis or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from command-line arguments, standard input, and files specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Outputs instruction lists and disassembly results to standard output; no evident data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data from stdin or files -> EvmBytecode object -> disassemble() method -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of logging and argument parsing is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging, parses command-line arguments, and conditionally lists instructions or disassembles bytecode. It reads input data from files or stdin, processes the data via imported classes, and outputs results. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for analyzing EVM bytecode with standard patterns and safe data handling. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility for disassembling EVM bytecode and listing instructions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
