{
  "purpose": "A command-line utility for disassembling and listing instructions related to EVM bytecode, likely for analysis or debugging.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, files read from filesystem, standard input stream",
  "sinks": "Reading files, reading from stdin, outputting disassembly and instruction list to console",
  "flows": "User input -> argument parsing -> conditional logic -> reading files or stdin -> disassembling bytecode -> output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical command-line tool with argument parsing, file handling, and disassembly functions. It imports modules for disassembly and instruction registry, performs input validation, and outputs results to the console. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. All code appears to serve legitimate disassembly and listing purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard disassembler utility for EVM bytecode with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes user inputs, reads files or stdin, and outputs disassembly information. No malware or security threats identified.",
