{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up imports and module-level constants for an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) disassembler or analysis tool, likely used for bytecode analysis or reverse engineering.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: .instructions and .disassembler.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in __ALL__ variable: 'EvbBytecode' instead of 'EvmBytecode', which could cause import issues but not malicious activity. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module imports and an export list. The typo in the __ALL__ list is likely unintentional and could prevent correct module export but does not indicate malicious intent. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, or network activity present. Overall, this snippet is benign, serving as a setup for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for an EVM bytecode analysis library, with a minor typo in the export list. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
