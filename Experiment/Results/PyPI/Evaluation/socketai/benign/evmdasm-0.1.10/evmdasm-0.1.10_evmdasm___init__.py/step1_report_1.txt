{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module imports and exports related to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode disassembly and instructions, likely for a disassembler or analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.instructions and .disassembler)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present; no handling of untrusted data observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily module setup and export definitions",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in __ALL__ list: 'EvbBytecode' should likely be 'EvmBytecode'. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes from local modules related to EVM bytecode analysis and defines an export list. The typo in __ALL__ may affect module exports but does not introduce malicious behavior. No input handling, network operations, or data processing present that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward module initializer with a minor typo. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger Ethereum bytecode analysis project.",
