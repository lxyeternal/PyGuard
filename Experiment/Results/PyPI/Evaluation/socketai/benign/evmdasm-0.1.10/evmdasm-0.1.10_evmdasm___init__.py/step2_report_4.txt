  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a Python module that imports classes from local modules `.instructions` and `.disassembler`.\n- It defines an `__ALL__` list intended to specify module exports.\n- Notably, there is a typo: `'EvbBytecode'` instead of `'EvmBytecode'`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The typo in `__ALL__` (`'EvbBytecode'`) is consistently identified across reports.\n- No other anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code, are observed.\n\n### Security and Malicious Behavior:\n- No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity.\n- The typo does not introduce security vulnerabilities but could affect module import/export behavior.\n\n### Logical Flaws:\n- The typo in `__ALL__` is a minor oversight that may cause import issues but does not affect security.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign module setup for an EVM disassembler.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable since there's no evident security risk.\n\n### Potential Inconsistencies:\n- The reports uniformly agree on the typo and benign nature, which aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor typo, no security impact)\n\n**Note:** The typo in `__ALL__` should be corrected to `__all__` for proper Python module behavior, but this is a minor maintenance issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign module setup with a minor typo that doesn't impact security. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the actual code analysis.",
