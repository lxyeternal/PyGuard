  "purpose": "Module setup for EVM disassembler classes and export list definition.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.instructions' and '.disassembler'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in '__ALL__' list: 'EvbBytecode' instead of 'EvmBytecode'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and defines an export list. The only anomaly is a minor typo in the '__ALL__' list, which could cause import issues but does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The typo is a minor maintenance issue rather than a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with a minor typo. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 due to the absence of security issues. The typo should be corrected for proper module functionality but does not impact security.",
