{
  "purpose": "Define a set of classes representing different argument types, likely for use in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data is being output or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a class with a comment indicating a to-do item, inconsistent indentation (extra space before 'class Internal'), but no malicious or suspicious code functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from str, with class attributes defining '_type'. There are no functions, data input, network operations, or data handling that could be exploited. The comment about overriding ID suggests future development but is not implemented. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a straightforward type system or data model setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of class definitions used for representing different argument types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
