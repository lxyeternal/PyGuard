{
  "purpose": "Define argument classes, likely for blockchain or smart contract context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from str, no data input/output or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; code does not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Indentation inconsistencies causing syntax errors; commented 'todo' note; no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from str, each with a static '_type' attribute. The indentation errors are syntax issues, not malicious behavior. No data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The minor formatting issues do not impact security but should be corrected for proper execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data type hierarchy for argument specifications, with no malicious activity or security risks. The only concern is minor syntax errors due to indentation, which are non-security related. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minor formatting issues.",
