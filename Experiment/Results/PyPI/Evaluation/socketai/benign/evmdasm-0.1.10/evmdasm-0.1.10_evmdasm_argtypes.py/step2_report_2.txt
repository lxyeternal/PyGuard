  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues identified:** None; the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** None; the only note is a commented-out 'todo' for overriding 'ID', which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues identified:** An indentation inconsistency before the 'class Internal' declaration, likely a syntax error.\n- **Errors or anomalies:** The indentation mistake is a formatting error, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the small risk score accounts for the syntax error, which could cause runtime issues but not security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign; the indentation error is a minor formatting issue.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues identified:** Similar indentation error, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent with a formatting problem.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign code with a minor syntax issue.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues identified:** Indentation error, no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks; just a syntax mistake.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues identified:** Indentation inconsistency, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a minor formatting issue.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely class definitions for data types.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to indentation errors that could cause syntax errors but do not pose security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The indentation issues should be corrected to ensure code can run without syntax errors.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in the provided code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor syntax issues, but no security implications)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, primarily defining data type classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only notable point is formatting errors that should be fixed for proper execution.",
