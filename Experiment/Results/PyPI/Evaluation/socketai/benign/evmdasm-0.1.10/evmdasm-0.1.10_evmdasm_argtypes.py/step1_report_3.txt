  "purpose": "Define classes representing various argument types with associated string type identifiers.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are simple data containers.",
  "anomalies": "Indentation error before the 'todo' comment; no actual code execution or input handling. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of classes inheriting from str, each with a '_type' attribute indicating a data type. The presence of an indentation error suggests a code formatting issue but no malicious intent. No external data reading, network activity, or obfuscated code. No suspicious behaviors or embedded malware. The classes are straightforward and serve as data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for data argument types. It contains a minor formatting error but no malicious or security-sensitive issues are evident.",
