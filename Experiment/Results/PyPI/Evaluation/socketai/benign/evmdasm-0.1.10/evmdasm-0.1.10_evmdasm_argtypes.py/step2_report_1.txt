  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reported issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from `str`, each with a static `_type` attribute.\n- There are multiple indentation errors (e.g., `class Internal` not aligned properly), which would cause syntax errors in execution.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The only notable anomalies are formatting issues and a commented-out 'todo' note.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Define argument classes, likely for blockchain or smart contract context.\n- Findings: No malicious activity; code is benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- The high confidence score is justified.\n- No issues here; the code is simple and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomaly: Indentation inconsistency, which suggests a syntax error.\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report appropriately notes the indentation error as a syntax issue, not malicious.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting a minor formatting problem, not a security vulnerability.\n- The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomaly: Indentation error.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 2, the analysis is sound.\n- The minor formatting issue does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomaly: Indentation error.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly identifies the indentation issue.\n- The confidence is slightly lower, which is reasonable given the syntax error.\n- The security risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomaly: Comment about a 'todo' and inconsistent indentation.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is accurate.\n- The minor formatting issues do not imply malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only concern is the indentation errors, which are syntax issues, not security vulnerabilities. A score of 0.1 for security risk is reasonable, reflecting the formatting problems but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor syntax issues, no security implications.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The indentation errors should be corrected for code execution.\n- The 'todo' comment indicates future development but does not currently pose a risk.\n- The code's purpose appears to be defining argument types for a larger system, likely in blockchain contexts, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with minor formatting issues that do not constitute security risks. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
