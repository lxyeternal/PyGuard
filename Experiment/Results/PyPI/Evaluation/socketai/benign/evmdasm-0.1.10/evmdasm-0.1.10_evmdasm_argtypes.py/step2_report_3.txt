  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states the code is only class definitions with no data flow, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed only defines classes inheriting from str, with static '_type' attributes. No input/output, no network activity, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Mentions an indentation inconsistency at 'class Internal' but clarifies it's likely accidental, not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The indentation error is a syntax issue, not obfuscation or malicious intent. No malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the syntax error.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the syntax error but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 2, with an indentation error noted, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward; the indentation error would cause a syntax error but is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with an indentation mistake but no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is simple class definitions; the syntax error is a formatting issue.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, mentions indentation inconsistency and a 'todo' comment, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code remains benign; the comment and indentation are minor issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1), reflecting minor syntax issues but no security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- The code is a simple, benign set of class definitions for argument types, possibly for a larger blockchain or smart contract framework.\n- The indentation errors are syntax issues, not obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor syntax issues, no security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with minor formatting issues that do not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
