{
  "purpose": "Manages test report data, outcomes, environment info, and logs for pytest reports.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration via config.getini(), report sections, and logs; accesses report object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizes logs with _handle_ansi and escape functions before storage or display.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into class attributes; logs flow from report sections through sanitization into stored logs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a deprecated warning for 'render_collapsed' configuration, which is benign; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test report management class, with no network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. External functions are assumed to be safe sanitizers. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident, and the code adheres to good practices for sanitization and configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test reporting utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and appropriate.",
