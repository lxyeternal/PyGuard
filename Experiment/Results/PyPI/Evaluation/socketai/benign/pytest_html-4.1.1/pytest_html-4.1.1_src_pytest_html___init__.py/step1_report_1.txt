{
  "purpose": "Define the package version and PyPI URL, attempting to import version info from a local module or fallback.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local module '.__version__' and the string assignment for __pypi_url__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used in a way that could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to import version info; the fallback to a static string is benign. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version attribute from a local module, which is common in Python packaging. If the import fails, it defaults __version__ to 'unknown'. The __pypi_url__ is a static URL string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose related to package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata handling with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages version info and a URL.",
