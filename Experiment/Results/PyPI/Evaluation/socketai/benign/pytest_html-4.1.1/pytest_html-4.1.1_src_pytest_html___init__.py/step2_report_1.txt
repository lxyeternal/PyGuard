  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, attempting to import a local `__version` module to retrieve version info, with a fallback to `'unknown'`.\n   - It assigns a static URL to `__pypi_url__`.\n   - No untrusted data, user input, or external data flows are involved.\n   - The code structure is typical for package metadata management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the try-except pattern as common practice.\n   - No report suggests any actual vulnerability, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with typical Python packaging patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, so risk scores should remain low.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or access untrusted sources.\n   - The static URL is publicly known and harmless.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is boilerplate for package version handling.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.",
