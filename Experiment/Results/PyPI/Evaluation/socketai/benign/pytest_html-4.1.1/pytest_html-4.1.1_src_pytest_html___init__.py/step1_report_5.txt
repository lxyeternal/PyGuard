{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import version information from a local module and falls back to a default string if the import fails. It also defines a URL related to the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module __version__ and the assignment of the __pypi_url__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only assigns static values based on the import success.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with minimal complexity. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or suspicious constructs, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version attribute from a local module __version__; if it fails (ImportError), it assigns 'unknown' to __version__. This pattern is common in Python packages to handle versioning. The code then sets a URL to the PyPI page for pytest-html. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code's structure and content are typical for package version management and metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as a version fallback mechanism and setting a URL constant. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
