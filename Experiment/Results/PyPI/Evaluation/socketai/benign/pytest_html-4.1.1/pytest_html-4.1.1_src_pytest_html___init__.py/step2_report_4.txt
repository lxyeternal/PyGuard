  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Attempts to import `__version` from a local module.\n- If successful, sets `__version__` to `__version__.version`.\n- If not, defaults `__version__` to `\"unknown\"`.\n- Defines a static URL `__pypi_url__` pointing to the pytest-html package on PyPI.\n- The code is straightforward, typical for package metadata handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Common Points:**\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is to manage version info and package URL.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or data flows that could cause security issues.\n- Use of try-except is standard, with fallback to `\"unknown\"`.\n- The URL is static and publicly known.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence is high (1), and malware/obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- None of the reports identify actual malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- All assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code functions as described: importing version info with a fallback, defining a static URL. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All are zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not overstate or assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the analysis, **the code is a typical pattern for package version management**, with no malicious intent or security issues. The static URL is safe, and the import handling is standard practice.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0**. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
