{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import version information from a local module and sets a default value if the import fails. It also defines a URL for the package's PyPI page.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module (import . __version__) and assigns a string to __pypi_url__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to untrusted sources or external effects.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows are evident; import and assignment are straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if a local __version__ module can be imported, likely to obtain version info. If import fails, it defaults __version__ to 'unknown'. It also sets a URL pointing to the PyPI page for pytest-html. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations. The code is simple, straightforward, and standard for package version handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a normal version import with a fallback and defines a URL. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
