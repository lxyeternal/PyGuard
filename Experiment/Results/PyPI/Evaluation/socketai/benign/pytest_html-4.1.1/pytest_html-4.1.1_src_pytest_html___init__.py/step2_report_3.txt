  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code attempts to import a local `__version` module to set the `__version__` variable.\n- If the import fails, it defaults `__version__` to `'unknown'`.\n- It defines a static URL `__pypi_url__` pointing to the pytest-html package on PyPI.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for package metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, straightforward version handling.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. The code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard package version handling.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Comments:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard pattern.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard version import with fallback.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Comments:** Appropriate. No risks identified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; benign package metadata code.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Comments:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard pattern for package version handling with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero across reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are zero, indicating no risk.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, so a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  None. All reports base their conclusions on observable, standard code patterns.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, harmless package metadata snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. No changes needed. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that correctly.",
