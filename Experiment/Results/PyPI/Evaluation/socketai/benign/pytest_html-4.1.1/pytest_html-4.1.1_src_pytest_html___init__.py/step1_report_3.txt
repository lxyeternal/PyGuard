{
  "purpose": "Define the package version and PyPI URL, with fallback if version module is not available",
  "sources": "Import statement for __version__, access to __version__.version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input handling",
  "flows": "Attempt to import __version__, then assign __version__ or default to 'unknown'",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for import, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a local __version__ module and access its version attribute, which is a standard practice for version management. If import fails, it assigns 'unknown' to __version__, serving as a fallback. The URL assigned is a static string pointing to the PyPI page for pytest-html. No data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation evident. The code is straightforward and typical for version handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be boilerplate for package version handling and does not include any suspicious or harmful elements.",
