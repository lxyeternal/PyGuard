  "purpose": "Manage package version information and provide a static URL to the package on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Import of local __version module; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__ variable; static URL string assignment.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from __version__ module to set __version__; fallback to 'unknown'; static URL assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with fallback; static URL is publicly known.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a local __version__ module to retrieve version info, with a fallback to 'unknown'. It assigns a static URL to __pypi_url__. No untrusted data, user input, or dynamic code execution is involved. The structure is typical for package metadata management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package metadata code with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
