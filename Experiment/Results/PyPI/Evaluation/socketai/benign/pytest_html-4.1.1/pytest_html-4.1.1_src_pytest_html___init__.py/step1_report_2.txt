{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to set the package version from a local module or defaults to 'unknown'; it also defines a URL to the PyPI page for pytest-html.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '__version' and assigns a string URL to '__pypi_url__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data for security impact.",
  "flows": "The code tries to import '__version' to get version info; if it fails, it defaults to 'unknown'. No data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try-except block for import handling, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The URL is static and publicly known.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if a local '__version' module can be imported to extract version info. If not available, it sets the version as 'unknown'. It also defines a static URL to the PyPI package page. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic or malicious code execution. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are present. The code is typical for package version handling and external URL referencing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, handling version information with a fallback and defining a package URL. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
