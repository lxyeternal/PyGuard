  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code attempts to import a local `__version` module to retrieve a version attribute, with a fallback to `\"unknown\"` if the import fails. It also defines a static URL string pointing to the PyPI page for `pytest-html`. The code is straightforward, standard for package metadata management, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code performs a simple import with fallback and defines a static URL. No actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for version handling and URL assignment. No errors or flaws are evident beyond standard exception handling.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No flaws detected:** The logic is sound and typical for such use cases. The fallback to `\"unknown\"` is appropriate, and static URL assignment is benign.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is accurate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign `0`, which is correct given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential over- or under-scoring:\n- The reports' scores seem appropriate and consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities, as the code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation.\n- **Assumptions about malicious intent:** None are justified here; the code is boilerplate for package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks are present.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is standard, boilerplate package metadata code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The static URL is publicly known and not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's straightforward nature.",
