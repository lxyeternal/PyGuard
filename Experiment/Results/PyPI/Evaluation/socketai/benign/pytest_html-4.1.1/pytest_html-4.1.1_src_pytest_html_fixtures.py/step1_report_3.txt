{
  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures for adding extra information to HTML reports, with one fixture marked as deprecated.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pytest configuration (`pytestconfig.stash`) and the `warnings.warn` function.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to `pytestconfig.stash`, which is an internal storage mechanism, and issues a warning.",
  "flows": "The fixtures set and delete entries in `pytestconfig.stash`; the only external input is the `pytestconfig` object, which is controlled by the test framework.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No code executes external commands, network activity, or handles sensitive data. The `warnings.warn` call is standard for deprecation notices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two fixtures, `extra` (deprecated) and `extras`, which manipulate an internal stash within `pytestconfig` to store additional report data. The fixtures warn users about deprecation and manage stash entries by appending or deleting them. The use of `pytest` and `warnings` is typical for test utilities. There are no suspicious imports, code injections, or obfuscated constructs. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for test report enhancements. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks present in this code segment.",
