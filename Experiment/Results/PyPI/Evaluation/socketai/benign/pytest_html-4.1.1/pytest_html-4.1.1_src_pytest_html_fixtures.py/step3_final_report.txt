{
  "purpose": "Defines pytest fixtures 'extra' (deprecated) and 'extras' to add details to HTML reports by manipulating pytestconfig.stash; 'extra' issues a deprecation warning, 'extras' is current.",
  "sources": "pytestconfig.stash, which is manipulated to store report extras",
  "sinks": "Internal stash modification; no external sinks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Fixtures access pytestconfig.stash, append data (URLs or lists), then clear it after test execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; use of deprecation warning is standard; no obfuscated or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, managing internal data structures for test reporting. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The deprecation warning is standard practice. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores across reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard pytest fixture setup for report enhancement, with no malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
