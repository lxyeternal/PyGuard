{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures to add extra details to HTML reports, specifically for including URLs and other extras in test reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from pytestconfig and the stash associated with extras_stash_key.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to pytestconfig.stash and modifies it, but does not involve untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a stash, appends data to it via fixtures, then cleans up by deleting the stash contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no suspicious imports or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard pytest and warnings modules; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two fixtures, 'extra' (deprecated) and 'extras', both of which initialize a list in pytestconfig.stash using a key. The 'extra' fixture issues a deprecation warning. Both fixtures yield the list for use in tests, then clear it. The code is straightforward, using standard pytest practices with no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. It solely manipulates internal pytest state for report generation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of pytest fixtures for report customization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages internal state for testing purposes without any security concerns.",
