{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures to add details to HTML reports, including deprecated and current methods for appending extra information.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'pytestconfig.stash' object to store and retrieve lists of extras.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "The fixtures set up and tear down lists within 'pytestconfig.stash' but do not process external input or execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of warnings for deprecation is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard pytest fixtures with the deprecated 'extra' and the current 'extras' for adding information to HTML reports. It manipulates internal pytest objects without any data processing from external sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The usage of warnings is for deprecation purposes only and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pytest plugin setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply manages report data within the testing framework.",
