{
  "purpose": "This code provides pytest fixtures for adding extra information to HTML reports, with one fixture marked as deprecated.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pytest configuration object (pytestconfig) and the stash associated with it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that handle untrusted data leading to potential leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The fixtures set up a stash in pytestconfig and then clear it after the test, but do not process or execute any untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated functionality (the 'extra' fixture) with a warning, but this is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines fixtures for use in pytest testing framework to add extra details to HTML reports. It manages a stash for test-related data, which is cleared after use. No input/output handling of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations are present. The code is straightforward and primarily documentation and setup for reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for testing purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The use of deprecated fixtures is noted but not suspicious.",
