{
  "purpose": "This code provides pytest fixtures for adding extra information to HTML reports, specifically for deprecated and current methods of adding URLs to reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pytest configuration object `pytestconfig` and its `stash` attribute to store and retrieve report data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present. The code only manipulates internal report data and warnings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `pytestconfig.stash` (source) to the fixtures and back, with no external input or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and warnings modules, defines a stash key, and creates two fixtures: 'extra' (deprecated) and 'extras'. Both manipulate `pytestconfig.stash` to store URLs for HTML reports. The 'extra' fixture issues a deprecation warning, while 'extras' is the current method. No external data sources, user input, or network activity is involved. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code performs standard reporting setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard pytest fixtures for report enhancement without any malicious intent or security issues. It handles internal data structures for test reporting purposes only.",
