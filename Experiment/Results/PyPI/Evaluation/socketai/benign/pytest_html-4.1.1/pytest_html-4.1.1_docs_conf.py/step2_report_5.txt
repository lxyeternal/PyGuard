  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores align with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard configuration with no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard setup; no external or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, risk:** All scores are zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and do not overstate potential threats.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied; all assessments are cautious and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are well-founded, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a typical configuration file with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe entire set of reports accurately assesses the code as benign, with appropriate scoring and reasoning. No adjustments needed.",
