  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, extensions, theme options, and static paths.",
  "sources": "Imports os and sys modules; modifies sys.path; sets configuration variables for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no network or file operations; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It imports only standard modules, modifies sys.path in a typical manner, and sets configuration variables. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign setup intended for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
