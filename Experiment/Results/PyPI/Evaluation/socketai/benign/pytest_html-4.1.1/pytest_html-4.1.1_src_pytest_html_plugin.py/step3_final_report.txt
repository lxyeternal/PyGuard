  "purpose": "Setup configuration and plugin registration for pytest HTML reporting, including CSS handling and report options.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line options, CSS files, templates, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network activity detected.",
  "flows": "File existence checks and path expansions lead to plugin registration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard validation and warning usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pytest plugin setup, handling options, validating CSS file existence, reading templates, processing CSS, and registering report plugins. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious code is present. Warnings for deprecated features are typical. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest plugin setup for HTML reports with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.2 remains a conservative, acceptable estimate given external file handling. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
