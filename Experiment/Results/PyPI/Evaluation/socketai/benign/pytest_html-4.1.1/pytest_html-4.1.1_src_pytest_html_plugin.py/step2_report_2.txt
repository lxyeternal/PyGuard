  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes setup for pytest HTML reports, CSS handling, and report options.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code behaviors. The code performs file existence checks, reads templates, processes CSS, and registers report plugins. No network activity, no credential handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but justified due to potential external file handling, though no actual vulnerability is identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, configuring pytest HTML reports.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code. File validation and plugin registration are standard. No external data processing that could lead to code injection.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with potential external file handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines pytest plugin setup, CSS, and template handling.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code. Standard practices for reading files, handling options, and registering plugins. No network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configures pytest for HTML reports, handles CSS and templates.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. Validates file paths, reads files, and sets up reporting.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — aligns with potential external file inputs, but no actual risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar report setup, with focus on CSS and templates.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. File handling appears secure.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) for all reports, justified by external file handling but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, justified by external file handling and configuration, but no real security risk.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is standard pytest plugin setup code for HTML reporting, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
