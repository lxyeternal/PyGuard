  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest plugin setup for HTML reports with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.2 remains a conservative, acceptable estimate given external file handling. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
