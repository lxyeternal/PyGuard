  "purpose": "Static version information assignment generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignments with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version module with static assignments and conditional type hint imports. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign, static nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe for use. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
