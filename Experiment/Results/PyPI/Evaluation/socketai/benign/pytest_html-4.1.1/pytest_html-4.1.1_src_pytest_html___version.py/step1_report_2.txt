{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version variables.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments and conditional imports, specifically the 'version' and '__version__' string and tuple definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static version values to variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and auto-generated, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports typing constructs when TYPE_CHECKING is True, which is a standard pattern for type hints. It then sets version-related variables to static, hard-coded version strings and tuples, which is typical for version management in Python packages. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic execution, or external data handling. The code appears to be boilerplate, auto-generated, and designed solely for version control purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version information boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe and solely used for version tracking.",
