  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version module created by setuptools_scm.\n- It performs static assignments of version strings and tuples.\n- It includes a conditional import for type hinting, which is a common pattern.\n- There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and typical for version management.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is correctly structured and follows standard practices.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.5; all correctly assign zero or minimal scores.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since the code is purely static and auto-generated, with no external data handling or dynamic execution, malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  Accurate. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, high confidence. Scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  Accurate. No issues, standard boilerplate, no risks. Scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  Accurate. Same reasoning applies. Scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  Accurate. Straightforward version info, no external data or malicious behavior. Scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  Accurate. Same conclusion, benign code, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores:**  \n  All should remain at 0, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code.\n\n- **Estimated overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Estimated overall obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Estimated overall risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet with no malicious or security issues. The reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways verify that no external code or dependencies are introduced alongside this snippet that could pose risks. But based solely on this code, it is safe and secure.",
