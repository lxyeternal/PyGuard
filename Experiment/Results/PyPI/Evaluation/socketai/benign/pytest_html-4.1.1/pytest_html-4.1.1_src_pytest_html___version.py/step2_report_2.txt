  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version module, setting version strings and tuples.\n- It includes a conditional block for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`) that imports typing constructs when needed.\n- All version values are static, hardcoded strings and tuples.\n- No external data, dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious logic is present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies version info assignment.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, auto-generated, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static assignment and type import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states it's boilerplate version info, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same as above; consistent and correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Similar observations; no external input or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Consistent with previous; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, auto-generated version info.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No; all reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are set to zero for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious activity, no external data, no dynamic code.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** None claimed or implied; all claims are accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not obfuscated; code is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious elements, I would **maintain the scores as they are**.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe version module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
