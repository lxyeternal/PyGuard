{
  "purpose": "Define version information and types for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The code assigns static version strings and constructs a version tuple.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; only static assignment.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses conditional type checking, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables, with a conditional type hinting block that imports typing constructs if type checking is active. All version values are statically assigned strings and tuples. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard auto-generated version module with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign version declaration file generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and does not pose any security risks.",
