  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and sets version variables accordingly.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, type checking block importing typing annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static version data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The TYPE_CHECKING block and variable assignments are standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for a package, with a conditional import block for type annotations. All code is static and derived from package metadata. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and solely related to version management.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
