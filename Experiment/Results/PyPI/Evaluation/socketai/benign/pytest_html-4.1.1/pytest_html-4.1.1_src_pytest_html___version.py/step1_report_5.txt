  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to be used in package management and version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it assigns static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward version assignment with no obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, with a conditional import block for type checking that does not execute at runtime. All version values are hardcoded static strings and tuples. The structure is typical for version management and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version definition snippet, generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
