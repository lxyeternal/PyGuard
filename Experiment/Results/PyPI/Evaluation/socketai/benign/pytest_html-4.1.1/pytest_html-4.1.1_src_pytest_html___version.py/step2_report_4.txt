  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version module from setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It uses a typical pattern for type hints with a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional.\n- No external data input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The code follows standard practices for version declaration.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware score (all reports):** 0  \n  Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Correct. No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very low  \n  Correct. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **confidence** scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- The **analysis** in each report is consistent: static, auto-generated, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues:\n- **Any assumptions?**  \n  The reports assume that static assignment and standard patterns equate to safety, which is valid here.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity questionable?**  \n  No. The claims are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring and reasoning. No changes needed.",
