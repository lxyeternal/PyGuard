  "purpose": "Utility for loading templates, processing CSS files, and handling ANSI sequences for HTML rendering in documentation or reporting tools.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS files, template files, and optionally ANSI sequences from environment or dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads files (CSS, templates) -> concatenates CSS -> applies ANSI styling if available -> renders templates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; fallback import for ANSI handling is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O for CSS and templates, uses conditional imports for optional dependencies, and sets up a Jinja2 environment. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or processing of untrusted input beyond file reading. The fallback for ANSI sequence removal relies on a testing utility, which is benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for template and style processing with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate; a slight adjustment to the overall risk score to 0.1 reflects minimal inherent security concern.",
