{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load Jinja2 templates, process CSS files, and handle ANSI to HTML conversion for rendering purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads template files from specified search paths, reads CSS files from provided paths, and conditionally imports modules for ANSI processing.",
  "sinks": "The code writes combined CSS content into a string, which is then presumably used for rendering; no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input CSS files are read and concatenated with additional styles and ANSI styles; template files are loaded from disk; ANSI conversion is performed conditionally.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of a module '_pytest.logging' for ANSI escape sequence removal suggests potential testing or fallback behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs detected. Usage of partial functions is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads template files securely via Jinja2's Environment and FileSystemLoader. CSS files are read from disk without processing user input, and the concatenation of CSS content appears straightforward. The conditional import for ANSI processing is a fallback mechanism, not malicious. No network connections, data leaks, or code injection points are present. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform any dangerous operations. Overall, the code performs benign file reading and template loading with standard libraries, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard template and CSS processing utility with no malicious behavior. No security risks are evident, and the code does not exhibit suspicious patterns. The implementation is safe and consistent with typical rendering workflows.",
