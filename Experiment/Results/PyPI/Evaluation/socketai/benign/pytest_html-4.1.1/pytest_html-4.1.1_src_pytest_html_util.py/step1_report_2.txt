{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load templates, process CSS files, and handle ANSI escape sequences for HTML conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS files from the filesystem, reads template files from specified search paths, and potentially reads environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Reads CSS files and templates, which could contain malicious content if tampered, but this appears to be standard file reading.",
  "flows": "CSS and template files are read and concatenated; ANSI escape sequences are processed or stripped based on available libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Uses conditional import to handle optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports libraries for templating and ANSI conversion, with fallback for missing modules. It reads CSS files and appends user-provided CSS from paths specified in 'extra_css'. The CSS content is concatenated with additional styling for ANSI support if applicable. The template loader loads templates from the filesystem. No external data is fetched or transmitted. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling templates and CSS, with fallback logic for optional libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
