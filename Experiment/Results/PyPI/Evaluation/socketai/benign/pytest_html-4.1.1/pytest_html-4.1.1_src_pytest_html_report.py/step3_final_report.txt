  "purpose": "Manage report assets including CSS and media files by creating directories, writing CSS, decoding base64 media, and saving content files.",
  "sources": "Input content for CSS and media, particularly base64-encoded media content.",
  "sinks": "File system where content is written; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Content is received as input, base64-decoded (if applicable), then written to disk, with paths returned relative to report directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard file and data handling with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages report assets securely, decodes base64 media with validation, and writes files without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is appropriate, and the logic is straightforward. No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a report asset manager with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified.",
