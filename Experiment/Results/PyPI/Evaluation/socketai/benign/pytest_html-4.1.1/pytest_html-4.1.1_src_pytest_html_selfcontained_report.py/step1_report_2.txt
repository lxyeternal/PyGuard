  "purpose": "Generate self-contained HTML reports by encoding content and media as data URIs.",
  "sources": "Input content to the methods _data_content and _media_content; report_data parameter in constructor.",
  "sinks": "Returning data URIs for embedding content in HTML; potential external resource links if content is not base64.",
  "flows": "Content is encoded in _data_content and potentially returned as data URI; _media_content validates base64 and returns either data URI or external link.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The only warning is for non-base64 content, which is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides methods to encode content into base64 data URIs for embedding in HTML reports, with validation for media content. It warns if media content isn't base64-encoded, indicating the content may be an external resource. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert backdoors. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for embedding media in self-contained reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating self-contained HTML reports with embedded media. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the warning for non-base64 media, which is a standard validation step.",
