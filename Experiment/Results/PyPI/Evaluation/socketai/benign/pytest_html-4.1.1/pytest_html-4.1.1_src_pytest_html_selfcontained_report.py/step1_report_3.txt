{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass SelfContainedReport for generating self-contained HTML reports, encoding content as base64 data URIs for embedding.",
  "sources": "Input data includes report content and media content provided to methods _data_content and _media_content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements in _data_content and _media_content, which embed data into HTML via data URIs.",
  "flows": "Content from input is encoded or validated, then embedded into HTML as data URIs; base64-encoded content flows from input to output without external links.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code properly validates base64 content, issues warnings for non-base64 media, and encodes data for embedding. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on encoding report content and media as base64 data URIs for self-contained HTML reports. It uses standard libraries (base64, binascii, warnings) and a known base class. The only notable behavior is the validation of base64 content, which is a standard security measure. No external data leaks, malicious code, or backdoors are evident. The code appears well-structured and legitimate, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for embedding content securely within HTML reports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
