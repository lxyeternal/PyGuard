{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to generate self-contained HTML reports by embedding content and media directly within the report using data URLs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in the methods '_data_content' and '_media_content', where 'content' is provided as a parameter, and also indirectly reads report data during report generation.",
  "sinks": "The data URLs generated by '_data_content' and '_media_content' are used as sinks where embedded data is incorporated into the HTML report, potentially affecting how data is embedded or displayed.",
  "flows": "Input data ('content') flows into '_data_content' and '_media_content'; in '_data_content', content is encoded in base64; in '_media_content', the code checks if content is base64-encoded before embedding or linking externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a base64 validation to determine if content is encoded, issuing a warning if content is not base64-encoded. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code’s behavior is consistent with report generation utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for encoding and warnings, and a base report class from pytest_html. The 'SelfContainedReport' class extends this base, overriding methods to embed data as base64 URLs within HTML reports. '_data_content' encodes input content as base64, creating a data URL. '_media_content' attempts to validate if content is already base64-encoded; if not, it issues a warning and returns the original content, potentially linking to external resources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears focused on embedding content into reports in a controlled manner, with appropriate warnings for non-base64 content. It does not contain any signs of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a report generation utility that embeds content securely and warns when external resources are referenced. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation aligns with standard report creation practices.",
