  "purpose": "Define a class SelfContainedReport for generating HTML reports with embedded media and CSS, extending a base report class.",
  "sources": "Inputs include 'content' parameters in _data_content and _media_content methods, as well as report_path, config, report_data, template, css parameters during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential data injection through 'content' in _data_content and _media_content methods; base64 encoding operations. No external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Content is encoded or validated for base64, then embedded into HTML as data URIs; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious logic; code uses standard library functions for encoding and warnings, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a report class that encodes content for embedding in HTML reports, with mechanisms to handle base64 content and warn about external links. It inherits from a known base report class. The use of base64 encoding, data URI embedding, and warnings are standard practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for report generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of report generation with embedded media content, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
