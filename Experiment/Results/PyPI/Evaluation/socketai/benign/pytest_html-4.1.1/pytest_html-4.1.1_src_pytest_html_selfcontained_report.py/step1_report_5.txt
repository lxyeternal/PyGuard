  "purpose": "To generate self-contained HTML reports by encoding content as base64 data URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'content' in _data_content and _media_content methods.",
  "sinks": "Embedding encoded content into data URLs for HTML reports.",
  "flows": "Content is encoded with base64 in _data_content, checked and potentially embedded as a data URL in _media_content.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding and decoding for content embedding, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious code. No external network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating self-contained reports by encoding report content into base64 data URLs. It checks if media content is already base64 encoded before embedding, issuing a warning if not. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward, primarily encoding and embedding data for report generation, with no external network calls, credential handling, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for report generation without malicious intent. It carefully encodes data for self-contained HTML reports and handles encoding validation properly. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
