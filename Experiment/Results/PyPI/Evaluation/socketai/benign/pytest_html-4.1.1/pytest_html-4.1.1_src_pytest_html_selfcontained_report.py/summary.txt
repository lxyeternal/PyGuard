  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for embedding content into HTML reports. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (around 0.1–0.2) are justified given the minimal potential for external resource linking warnings. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
