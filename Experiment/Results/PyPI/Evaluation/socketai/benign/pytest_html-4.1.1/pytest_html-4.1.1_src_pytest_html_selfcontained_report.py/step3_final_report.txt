  "purpose": "Provides methods to embed content and media into HTML reports as data URIs, ensuring self-containment.",
  "sources": "Content passed to _data_content and _media_content methods; external resources linked via content strings.",
  "sinks": "Embedding functions that convert content into data URIs; warnings issued for non-base64 media content.",
  "flows": "Content input → validation/encoding → embedding as data URI or warning → report generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard base64 validation and warning mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending a report base, encoding content into base64 data URIs for embedding. It validates media content, issuing warnings if not already base64-encoded, which is standard practice. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, using standard libraries, and aligns with benign report generation utilities. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for embedding content into HTML reports. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (around 0.1–0.2) are justified given the minimal potential for external resource linking warnings. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
