  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a UI framework with data fetching via external JS functions. No secrets or credentials are found.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from external JS functions into internal structures and visualization components. No direct malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of json.loads on external data is standard but should be trusted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk (0.2), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence (0.8). The report is reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign. No malicious behavior detected. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description; data from external functions, no secrets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data used in visualization components, standard pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns. External functions could be exploited if compromised, but within this code, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2. Consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate UI framework, no malicious intent. Risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on data visualization and external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from external JS functions into components; no unsafe system commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Reliance on external functions is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-structured, no malicious behavior. Risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing data visualization and external data fetching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from external JS functions into components; no system commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. No code injection or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Standard UI framework, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on data handling and visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from external functions, no data exfiltration or command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Reliance on external functions could be a concern but not evident here.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.8), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Typical data visualization code, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk scores:** All low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, assuming external JS functions are trustworthy.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The reliance on external JS functions (`search`, `findItem`, `runAction`) is standard in such frameworks but could be a vector if those functions are compromised. However, within this code, no malicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of json.loads on external data is common but should be trusted; no unsafe eval or code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured UI and data visualization framework with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The current malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk due to external data sources, but overall very low)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed review of specific parts.",
