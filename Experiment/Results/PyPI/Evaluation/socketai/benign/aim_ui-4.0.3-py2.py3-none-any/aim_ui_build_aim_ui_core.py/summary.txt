  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent UI and visualization library with no embedded malware or sabotage. The primary concern is external JS functions, which are outside the scope of this code snippet. The internal code is safe, with low security risk scores consistent with reliance on external data sources but no malicious behavior."
