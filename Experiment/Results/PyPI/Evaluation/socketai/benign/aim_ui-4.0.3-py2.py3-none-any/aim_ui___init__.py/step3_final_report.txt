{
  "purpose": "The code reads environment variables and user input, processes data, and may perform network or system operations without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, imported modules handling network or system functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow into network sockets, file system, or system commands if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment/user input) into processing functions, possibly leading to network or system sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, primarily handling data from environment variables and user input. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors is evident. The data flow from untrusted sources into sinks could pose risks if inputs are mishandled, but no exploitation or malicious activity is observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The confidence level is high, and the malware score is set to 0. The security risk score is slightly increased to 0.4 to account for potential data handling issues, aligning with the conservative approach recommended in the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security risk is low but warrants cautious handling of untrusted inputs. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal security concerns.",
