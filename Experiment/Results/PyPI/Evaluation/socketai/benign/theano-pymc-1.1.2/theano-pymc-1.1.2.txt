      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source version management utility for Python projects. It performs expected functions without malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security concern is the use of subprocess calls, which could be exploited if environment variables are compromised, but this is standard for build tools. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."

The reports are empty, providing no additional concerns. The security risk is minimal, and malware suspicion is unwarranted."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified by the environment validation step, which is a standard security measure rather than a threat."

The security risk is low, primarily related to deployment context. The scores are consistent with its purpose: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2)."

The warnings about non-determinism are standard and do not imply security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0, with only a minor concern about non-determinism warnings which are not security-related."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score reflects inherent subprocess risks but does not indicate malicious behavior."
