{
  "purpose": "Defines an ordered mapping from SharedVariable objects to their new values, supporting update operations and union via '+' operator.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as dictionaries passed to __init__, update, and __add__ methods. It also reads from SharedVariable keys during key validation.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns values to the OrderedUpdates mapping, but does not write data outside its scope. It does not perform any output operations or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are validated and used to populate the OrderedUpdates object; keys are checked for type; values are stored. No external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs type checks and warnings about non-deterministic behavior but nothing unusual or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing shared variables and their updates, with type enforcement and warnings for non-deterministic input. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious intent. The use of warnings and type checks appears to promote correct usage rather than conceal malicious behavior. No external data transmission, system manipulation, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for managing updates of shared variables in Theano. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and intended for internal data management within a larger application.",
