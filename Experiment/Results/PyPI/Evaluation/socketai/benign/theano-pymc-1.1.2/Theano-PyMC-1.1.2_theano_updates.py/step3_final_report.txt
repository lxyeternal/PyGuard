  "purpose": "Manages a deterministic ordered mapping from SharedVariable objects to their new values, supporting union operations and enforcing type safety.",
  "sources": "Initialization with dictionaries or OrderedDicts, update method with other mappings",
  "sinks": "Internal data structure updates, warnings about non-determinism",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries or OrderedDicts to internal OrderedDict storage",
  "anomalies": "Warnings about non-determinism when initializing or updating with non-OrderedDicts; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a specialized dictionary class for managing updates to SharedVariable objects in Theano, enforcing key types and issuing warnings when non-OrderedDicts are used to prevent non-deterministic behavior. No external data flows, network activity, or system commands are present. The code is straightforward, purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The type checks and warnings are standard for ensuring deterministic behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The overall structure and logic indicate a benign utility class for internal use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for managing shared variable updates in Theano. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The warnings about non-determinism are standard and do not imply security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0, with only a minor concern about non-determinism warnings which are not security-related.",
