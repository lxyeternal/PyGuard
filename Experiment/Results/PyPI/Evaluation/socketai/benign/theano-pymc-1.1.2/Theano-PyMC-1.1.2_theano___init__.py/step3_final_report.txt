  "purpose": "Initialization and configuration setup for the Theano library, including logging, environment validation, and module imports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, sys.path, imported modules, configuration flags, and GPU detection logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external communications; environment validation raises an error to prevent conflicts.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and sys.path for validation; imports modules for core functionality and GPU support.",
  "anomalies": "The check that raises RuntimeError if the theano directory is in sys.path is a security measure, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup routines for a scientific library, including logging configuration, environment validation, and module imports. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment check is a common security best practice to prevent namespace conflicts or supply chain issues. Utility functions operate on tensor data and are typical for such libraries. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing routine initialization and environment validation for the Theano library. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified by the environment validation step, which is a standard security measure rather than a threat.",
