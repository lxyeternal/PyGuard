  "conclusion": "The code serves as a debugging aid with no malicious intent. It can be misused if deployed improperly but does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to deployment context. The scores are consistent with its purpose: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2)."
