{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization, debugging, and pretty-printing utilities for Theano graphs, including functions for graph visualization with pydot, debug printing of variables and graphs, and descriptive string representations of variables and nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads variables, nodes, attributes, profiles, and graph structures; accesses external libraries (pydot_ng, pydot); hashes numpy array data for descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Outputs images/files (PNG, SVG), debug strings, descriptive strings; writes to files; prints to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads variables and graph nodes; processes and generates visualization images or debug strings; writes images to files or returns image objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; use of external libraries is optional and standard; hashing numpy arrays is benign; dynamic import fallback is standard but could be exploited if manipulated, though no evidence here.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for graph visualization and debugging, utilizing safe external libraries and standard hashing for variable descriptors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are well-structured, with proper error handling and safe practices. The external dependencies are optional and fallback mechanisms are standard. No obfuscation patterns are detected; the code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for debugging and visualizing Theano graphs. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code's purpose and practices.",
