  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes for printing, visualizing, and debugging Theano computational graphs, including pretty-printing, graph visualization with pydot, and descriptive string representations of variables and graphs.",
  "sources": "Data read from variables, nodes, apply objects, function outputs, and internal graph structures such as owners and inputs.",
  "sinks": "Output to files (e.g., image files, dot files), console output via print statements, and potentially return of image objects for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variables, nodes, and graph objects through visualization functions that process and generate descriptions or images, potentially writing files or returning image objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import with fallback, which could be manipulated to hide malicious imports or code execution, but no such behavior is present here. The code performs file writes and image generation based on graph data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of hashing for ndarray descriptors is benign. No suspicious input handling or untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements visualization and debugging utilities for Theano graphs, including functions for pretty-printing, graph visualization via pydot, and detailed variable descriptions. It dynamically imports pydot or pydot_ng with error handling, which could be exploited if manipulated, but currently is standard. Functions for printing graphs and variables operate on known data structures, with no evidence of malicious code injection, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized network communication. File writing and image creation are used explicitly for visualization purposes, consistent with the intended debugging functionality. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The code does include some use of hashlib to generate variable descriptors, which is benign. Overall, the code performs legitimate graph visualization and debugging functions without suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for visualizing and debugging Theano computation graphs, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles graph data securely, with appropriate error handling, and does not contain hidden or obfuscated malicious code. The dynamic import fallback is standard practice and does not pose a security threat in this context.",
