  "purpose": "Static JSON string containing version metadata, parsed by get_versions() function.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string 'version_json' within the code.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function parsing the static JSON; no untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "The static JSON string is loaded by json.loads() when get_versions() is called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports json, defines a static JSON string with version info, and provides a function to parse and return this data. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The JSON is static and auto-generated, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely to provide version metadata. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code is simple, safe, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a static version info loader. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
