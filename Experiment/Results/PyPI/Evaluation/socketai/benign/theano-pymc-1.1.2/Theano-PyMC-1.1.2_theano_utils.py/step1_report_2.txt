  "purpose": "Utility functions for general-purpose programming, including exception handling, subprocess management, hashing, memoization, and data structure enhancements.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, system architecture info, and command outputs. It accepts command input for subprocess functions. It also inspects call stacks for warnings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if used improperly: subprocess commands can execute arbitrary code, environment variables can be modified, and exception messages could leak info. However, no direct malicious code or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables, system info, and subprocess commands can influence subprocess execution. Exception handling flows propagate error info. Decorators and data structures manage internal states.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected. The subprocess functions use safe practices, and exception handling is standard. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with standard implementations. The subprocess wrappers are cautious, avoiding unsafe command executions by handling platform differences and using 'shell=True' only when necessary. The exception hooks and warning filters are standard, and no malicious logic is evident. Data structures like DefaultOrderedDict and singleton patterns are typical. Hashing uses SHA256 correctly, with minimal risk. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious intent. It handles exceptions, subprocesses, hashing, and data structures securely and predictably. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks were detected.",
