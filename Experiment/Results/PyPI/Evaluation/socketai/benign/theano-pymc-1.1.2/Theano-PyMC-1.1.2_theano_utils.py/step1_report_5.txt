  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions related to exception handling, subprocess management, hashing, and data structures. The subprocess functions, especially subprocess_Popen, do include behaviors like setting startupinfo and using shell=True with string commands, which can be exploited if untrusted data is passed as command input. However, these functions appear designed for internal use with controlled inputs. The environment variable manipulation is straightforward and not suspicious. The exception hooks and warnings are standard patterns. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. Overall, the code presents typical utility functions with some risk inherent in subprocess execution, but nothing suggests malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard utility functions without malicious behavior. The subprocess functions could pose risks if external untrusted data is passed directly, but this is common in controlled internal code. There are no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is low, assuming controlled usage.",
