  "purpose": "Collection of utility functions relying solely on the Python standard library, including exception handling, subprocess management, hashing, data structures, and warning filtering.",
  "sources": "No external untrusted sources are read within the code; functions accept parameters but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls, environment variable modifications, exception messages, and logs. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Commands passed to subprocess functions; environment variables modified; exception messages propagated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Use of subprocess with shell=True and command strings is standard but could be risky if external inputs are passed unchecked.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of utility functions with standard implementations. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Subprocess wrappers handle platform differences and are cautious, but the use of shell=True and command strings warrants caution if external inputs are involved. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are justified based on the code's content and potential inherent risks in subprocess handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured collection of utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score reflects inherent subprocess risks but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
