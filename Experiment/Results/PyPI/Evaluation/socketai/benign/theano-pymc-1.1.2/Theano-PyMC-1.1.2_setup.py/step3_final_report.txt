  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Theano-PyMC project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading static description files, package metadata definitions, dependency declarations, and entry point configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static files and well-known modules are used without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading description files -> setting package metadata -> installing dependencies -> defining entry points; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; code is straightforward and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It reads static files, uses common libraries, and defines package metadata and entry points. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, though the second report's security risk score could be lowered from 0.1 to 0 for full consistency.",
