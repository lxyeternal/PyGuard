{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Theano-PyMC package, primarily for packaging, dependency management, and installation configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading DESCRIPTION.txt file for long description; environment variables are not directly accessed; input data appears only from static files for package data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input; no network operations, system modifications, or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; the code mainly gathers static data and configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors. The script employs standard setup patterns with no obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries and a versioning tool, reads static description data from a file, and defines package metadata and dependencies. It constructs a setup() call with typical parameters for Python packaging. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or network communications. The package data includes common resource files, and the entry point defines a console script. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a conventional setup script for packaging a Python project. It exhibits no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure and content align with standard practices, indicating a safe and legitimate package configuration.",
