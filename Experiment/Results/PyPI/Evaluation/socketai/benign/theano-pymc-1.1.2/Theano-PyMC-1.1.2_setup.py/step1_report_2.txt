  "sources": "Reads DESCRIPTION.txt file, imports versioneer module, and gathers package data and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for description; uses versioneer to determine version; sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations using setuptools and versioneer, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling. All dependencies and package data are defined statically. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It follows standard practices for package configuration.",
