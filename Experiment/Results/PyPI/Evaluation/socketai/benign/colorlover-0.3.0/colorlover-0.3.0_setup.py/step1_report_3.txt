  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'colorlover' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within the setup() function, including package metadata, author info, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no use of environment variables, user input, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard setup script conventions with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with fixed package metadata, including name, version, author info, URL, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no code execution, and no embedded malicious logic. The structure is straightforward and consistent with typical Python package setup files. The URL points to a GitHub repository that appears legitimate, and no signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It contains no obfuscated code, no external data sources, and no suspicious patterns. It is safe and typical for publishing a Python package.",
