{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for size formatting, memory string parsing, configuration value retrieval, and directory validation/creation for CLI tools.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, configuration objects, and filesystem checks.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations such as directory existence checks, creation, and permission validation.",
  "flows": "Input data from user arguments or configuration flows into validation functions and filesystem operations; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with proper validation and error handling. Directory validation includes permission checks and creation, which are typical. Parsing functions use regex and handle invalid input gracefully. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The functions are straightforward and align with common CLI utility practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It performs standard filesystem and configuration validation tasks safely. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
