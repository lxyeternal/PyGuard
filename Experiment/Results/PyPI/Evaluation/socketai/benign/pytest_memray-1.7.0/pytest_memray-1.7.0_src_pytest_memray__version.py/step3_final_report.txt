  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to __version__, serving as a package metadata indicator.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string \"1.7.0\" to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, typical in Python packaging. No inputs, outputs, or complex logic are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. No discrepancies or overlooked issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
