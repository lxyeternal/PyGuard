  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code snippets are benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - Each report correctly identifies the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The highest confidence is 1, with no suspicion of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is a simple version string assignment, with no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Given the code snippet is a standard version declaration, there is no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The reports are thorough and align well with the actual code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign version string assignment with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
