  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string value to the __version__ variable. This is a common practice for versioning in Python packages. There are no input, output, or logic operations, nor any signs of obfuscated or malicious code. It appears to be a standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
