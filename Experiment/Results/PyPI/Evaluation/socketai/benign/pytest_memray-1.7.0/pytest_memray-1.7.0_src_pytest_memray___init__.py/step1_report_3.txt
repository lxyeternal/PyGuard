{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be setting up module exports and importing specific components for a Python package, likely related to leak detection or stack analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version and marks) and module-level assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data handling, external inputs, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is primarily configuration/import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and classes/functions related to leak filtering and stack analysis, then exposes them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted code. All imports are from local modules, and there are no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages module exports for a package related to leak and stack analysis.",
