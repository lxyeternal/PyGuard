{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script, importing version info and classes, and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules ('._version' and '.marks')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; straightforward import and export setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module setup with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. It imports internal version and class definitions, then specifies public API via __all__. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, matching the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module initialization snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
