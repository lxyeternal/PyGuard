  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's initialization or module setup, mainly importing components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__ features and internal modules (_version, marks). No external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing beyond imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code follows standard module import and export conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, then imports specific components from local modules (_version and marks). It defines __all__ for explicit exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It solely manages imports and exports within a package context.",
