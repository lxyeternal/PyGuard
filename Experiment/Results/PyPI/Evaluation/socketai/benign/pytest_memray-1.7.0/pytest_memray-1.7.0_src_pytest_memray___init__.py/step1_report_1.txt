{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and import statements for a Python package, primarily for versioning and structural classes related to 'LeaksFilterFunction', 'Stack', and 'StackFrame'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module: ._version, .marks",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only internal imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and sets the __all__ attribute to define public API. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The imported modules, such as ._version and .marks, are not visible here, so their behavior cannot be assessed, but their presence alone is typical for a package structure. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present in this minimal module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages imports and exports for a package, with no suspicious or harmful activity detected.",
