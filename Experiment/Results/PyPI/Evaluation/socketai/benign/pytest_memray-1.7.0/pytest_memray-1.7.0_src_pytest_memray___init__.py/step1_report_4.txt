  "sinks": "None present; no data input/output or external connections in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths observed in this static code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup: importing a version string and classes from internal modules, then defining an explicit export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. It appears to be standard module initialization code, with no dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving as an initial setup for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
