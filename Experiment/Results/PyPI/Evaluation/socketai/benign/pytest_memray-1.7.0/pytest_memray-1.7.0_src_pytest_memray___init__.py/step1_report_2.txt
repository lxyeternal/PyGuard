{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's module, primarily responsible for importing specific classes and variables and defining what is exported when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._version, .marks",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imported variables and classes are assigned to the module's namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated features, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a package __init__.py or module entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and specific classes from submodules, then defines the __all__ list for explicit exports. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious operations. The structure is typical for Python package modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, serving to organize exports and imports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
