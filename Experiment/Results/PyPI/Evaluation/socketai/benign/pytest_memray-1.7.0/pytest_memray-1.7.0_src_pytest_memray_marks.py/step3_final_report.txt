{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for memory profiling, leak detection, and leak filtering using memray and pytest configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads memory allocation and leak data from memray's FileReader, and configuration/cache data from pytest configs.",
  "sinks": "Processes and filters memory data internally; no external commands, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from memray files, applies filters via user-defined functions, and generates textual reports about memory usage and leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Cache manipulations are straightforward for test tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard memory profiling utility that reads memory allocation records, applies optional filters, tracks previous memory states via cache, and generates detailed reports. It does not execute external commands, access network, or perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The structure is clear, with well-defined data classes and functions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious memory profiling and leak detection utility. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
