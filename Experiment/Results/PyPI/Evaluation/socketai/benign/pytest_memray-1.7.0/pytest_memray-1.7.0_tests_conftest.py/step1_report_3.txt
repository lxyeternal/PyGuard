  "purpose": "This code configures the testing environment by importing future annotations and specifying pytest plugins.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement and the assignment of pytest_plugins.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects security or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is just configuration declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. It uses standard syntax for setting up a test environment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for future annotations and a simple string assignment for pytest plugins. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for a test suite, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration snippet for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
