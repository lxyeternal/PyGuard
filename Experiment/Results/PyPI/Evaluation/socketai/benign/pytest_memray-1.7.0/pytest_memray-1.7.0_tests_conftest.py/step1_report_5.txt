{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up plugin configuration for pytest testing framework, specifically by importing future annotations support and specifying pytest plugins.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own static source, importing __future__.annotations and assigning pytest_plugins.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data or external data flows.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only contains static configuration statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing future features and defining pytest plugins. It does not process input data or execute untrusted code. The import statement is a standard Python feature, and the assignment of pytest_plugins is a common configuration pattern for pytest. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration snippet for testing purposes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
