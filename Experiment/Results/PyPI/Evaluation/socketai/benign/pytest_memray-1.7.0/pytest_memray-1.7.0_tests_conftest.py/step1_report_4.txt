  "purpose": "The code appears to set a future import for annotations and specifies a pytest plugin, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The future import statement and the assignment to pytest_plugins.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks related to untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code does not include any data flow from sources to sinks; it primarily sets configuration options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is minimal and standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__ to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a common practice for compatibility with newer Python versions. It also assigns a string to pytest_plugins, indicating the use of pytest testing framework plugins. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data leaks. The code is simple, straightforward, and typical for test configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a basic setup for testing environment configuration.",
