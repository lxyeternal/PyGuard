  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward import and variable assignment.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code only imports a future feature and assigns a string to a variable, with no external input or execution of untrusted code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assessed as safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same minimal configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no data flow, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Zero, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard setup code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard import and assignment, no dynamic code or external data.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Zero, matching the benign description.\n- **Justification:** Same as above.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assigned 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assigned 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assigned 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code as safe. There are no indications of hidden malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a minimal, standard pytest configuration snippet with no security concerns.",
