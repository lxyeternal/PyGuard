  "purpose": "Minimal pytest configuration snippet importing a future feature and assigning a plugin name.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and assignment to pytest_plugins variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature and assigns a string to a variable used for pytest plugin configuration. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external input, and no malicious or obfuscated code. The code serves a standard setup purpose and does not interact with untrusted data or perform any runtime actions that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All previous reports correctly assessed its safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
