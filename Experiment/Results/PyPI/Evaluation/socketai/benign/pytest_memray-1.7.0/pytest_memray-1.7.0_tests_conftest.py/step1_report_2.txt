{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a plugin configuration for pytest testing framework, likely to enable testing extensions or plugins.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code only defines a string for pytest plugins.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses __future__ import, which is normal for compatibility, and a string assignment to pytest_plugins; no unusual or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a future feature and assigning a plugin string. There are no functions, no data processing, and no external data handling. It appears to be standard setup code for a testing environment. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden operations, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely configuration-related for pytest. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
