{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring a testing environment for pytest by specifying a plugin.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own annotations and the string 'pytester' assigned to pytest_plugins.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply declares plugin configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__ to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a common practice for forward compatibility. It then assigns the string 'pytester' to the variable pytest_plugins, indicating the inclusion of a pytest plugin. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a minimal configuration snippet typical in test setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply sets up a plugin for testing purposes.",
