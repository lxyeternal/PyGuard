  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign pytest configuration snippet.\n- The code only contains an import from __future__ and an assignment to `pytest_plugins`.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input is involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n- All scores assigned are zero or very low, indicating no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward and matches the description.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no runtime risks.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws detected.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n**3. Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since the code is entirely benign, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified and appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard pytest configuration snippet.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The consistent, minimal nature of the code supports these scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such.",
