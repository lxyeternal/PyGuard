  "sources": "Module-level attribute assignments (string literals assigned to variables).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code consists solely of static variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares several string variables containing package metadata. No input handling, data processing, or external data interactions are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for package metadata files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a typical setup or module descriptor without any suspicious or harmful code.",
