  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for 'inputimeout' library, providing descriptive information about the package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; static metadata variables are assigned without data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in the URL ('inutimeout' instead of 'inputimeout'), which is a documentation or typo issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no executable logic, input/output, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is the URL typo, which does not impact security. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, static metadata, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
