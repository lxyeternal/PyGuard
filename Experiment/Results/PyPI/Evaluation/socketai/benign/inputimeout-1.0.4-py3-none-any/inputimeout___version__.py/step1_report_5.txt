  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'inputimeout' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks as there are only variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. The URL appears to have a typo ('inutimeout' instead of 'inputimeout'), but this is likely a documentation issue rather than malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of metadata variable assignments describing the package's properties. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic execution is present. The package info seems standard, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The misspelled URL may be a typo but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators. The only notable issue is a probable typo in the URL, which does not affect security.",
