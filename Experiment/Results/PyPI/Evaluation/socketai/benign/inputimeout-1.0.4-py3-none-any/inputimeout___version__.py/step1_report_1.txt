  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'inputimeout' Python module, providing descriptive information about the package.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no input/output operations, no network calls, no data processing or storage",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares static metadata variables with string assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and only contains metadata declarations without executable or complex constructs",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration for the Python package 'inputimeout'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
