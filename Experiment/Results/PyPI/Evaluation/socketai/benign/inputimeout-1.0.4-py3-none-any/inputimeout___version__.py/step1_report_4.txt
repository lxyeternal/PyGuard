  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'inputimeout' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author information, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment of string literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string values to metadata variables that describe the package. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, data processing, or external communications. The metadata appears typical for a Python package setup or module docstrings. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package metadata without any malicious intent or security issues. It simply provides descriptive information about the package.",
