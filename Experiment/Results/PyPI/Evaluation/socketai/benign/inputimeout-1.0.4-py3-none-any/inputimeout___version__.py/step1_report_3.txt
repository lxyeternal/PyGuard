  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'inputimeout' Python module, which provides multi-platform input with timeout functionality.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the variable assignments at the module level, defining package information such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present; the code only assigns static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package metadata declaration, with no active logic, input handling, or external interactions. It does not include any code that reads untrusted input or performs operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The metadata fields are static strings representing package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as descriptive information for the package 'inputimeout'.",
