{
  "purpose": "Provides input functions with timeout handling for both POSIX and Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdin, user keyboard input via msvcrt or selectors.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdout.write and flush for output; reads input data that could be untrusted if user input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sys.stdin or keyboard to the program variables; output data flows to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; code appears to be standard input handling. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines input functions with timeout capabilities for both POSIX and Windows environments, importing necessary modules dynamically. It handles user input and output display, managing timeouts and special characters. No external or untrusted data sources beyond user input are processed. No data leaks, no malicious system modifications, no network communication, and no credential handling are present. The code appears to be utility functions for user input with timeout features, common in CLI applications, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of input functions with timeout handling, without any malicious or suspicious activity. No malware or security risks detected.",
