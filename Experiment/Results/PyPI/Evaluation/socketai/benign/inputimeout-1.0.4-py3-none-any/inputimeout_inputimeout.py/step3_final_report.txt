{
  "purpose": "Provides cross-platform user input functions with timeout handling, supporting POSIX and Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from sys.stdin (posix_inputimeout) or msvcrt (win_inputimeout).",
  "sinks": "Returns user input; no external data transmission or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input functions read from untrusted user input sources; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard modules appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cross-platform input with timeout support, utilizing standard libraries (`selectors`, `termios`, `msvcrt`, `time`). It handles user input securely without external data leaks or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is utility-oriented, with no network activity or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for use. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects its utility nature.",
