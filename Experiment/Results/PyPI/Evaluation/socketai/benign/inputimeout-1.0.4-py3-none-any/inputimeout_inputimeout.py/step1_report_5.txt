{
  "purpose": "Provide input with a timeout feature for both POSIX and Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading input from sys.stdin (posix_inputimeout), reading keyboard input via msvcrt (win_inputimeout).",
  "sinks": "Returning user input, raising TimeoutOccurred exceptions, writing to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input is read from sys.stdin or msvcrt, then processed and returned; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system-specific modules (selectors, termios, msvcrt) is normal; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected; conditional imports are appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements system-dependent input with timeout features, using standard modules and practices for each platform. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. No suspicious data leaks, credential handling, or harmful actions are identified. The use of timeouts and input handling is straightforward and does not involve dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of platform-specific input with timeout functionality, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
