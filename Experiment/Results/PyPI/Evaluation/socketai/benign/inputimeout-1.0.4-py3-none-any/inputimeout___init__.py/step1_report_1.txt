  "purpose": "Import specific functions and metadata from internal modules for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: .inputimeout and .__version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve runtime data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed; import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions and metadata from internal modules within the package. No dynamic execution, data handling, or external communication occurs. The imported components appear to be related to versioning and input timeout functionality, both standard for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement block used to include package metadata and utility functions. It poses no security threats, malware risk, or suspicious activity.",
