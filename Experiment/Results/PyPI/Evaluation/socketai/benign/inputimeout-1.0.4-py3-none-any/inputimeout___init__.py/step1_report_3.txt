  "purpose": "Import modules and metadata attributes for package functionality and identification",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.inputimeout and __version__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing specific functions and metadata attributes from local modules. These imports are typical in Python packages for functionality and version info. No user input, environment variables, or external data is accessed. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import structure for a Python package's module initialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
