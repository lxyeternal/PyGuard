  "purpose": "Importing modules and metadata attributes for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .inputimeout and .__version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or external output found.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; only metadata and module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The imported modules relate to input handling and version metadata, typical in package setup. No suspicious or obfuscated code elements are present. The code appears to be part of a standard Python package initialization or module definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Python package modules, importing functions and metadata. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
