{
  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules related to input timeout handling and package metadata, serving as setup or utility functions within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .inputimeout and .__version__ modules, reading static module attributes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; static imports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing functions and metadata variables from internal modules. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, external communications, or suspicious patterns. The imported modules are standard for package setup and utility functions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements are standard and pose no threat. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and no modifications are necessary.",
