{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and metadata attributes related to a Python package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.inputimeout' and '.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data processing or output functions are invoked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code is straightforward module import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from local modules. The first import pulls 'inputimeout' and 'TimeoutOccurred' from a module named 'inputimeout'. The second import pulls package metadata attributes such as version, author, email, copyright, license, description, title, and URL from a '__version__' module. These are typical for a Python package to manage internal and external metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors. The structure and content are standard for package initialization or metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import of package components and metadata, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
