{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package, specifically related to Apache Airflow provider packages, for defining version dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current installed Airflow version from the 'airflow' module and a version string assigned to '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the RuntimeError exception that is raised if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the airflow version from the imported module, parsing version strings, comparing versions, and potentially raising an exception based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code performs a standard version check with a conditional raise.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license and comment headers. It imports modules and sets the __all__ variable. It then defines a __version__ string. The code uses the 'packaging.version' module to parse the current 'airflow' version and compares it to a minimum required version ('2.9.0'). If the installed Airflow version is less than 2.9.0, a RuntimeError is raised, indicating a dependency requirement. The logic is straightforward, with no untrusted input or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check for an Apache Airflow provider package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The purpose is to ensure compatibility. Overall, the code is benign and performs a simple version validation.",
