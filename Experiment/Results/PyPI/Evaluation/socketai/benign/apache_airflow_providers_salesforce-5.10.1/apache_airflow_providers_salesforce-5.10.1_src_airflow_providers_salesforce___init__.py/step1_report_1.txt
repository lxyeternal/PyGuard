{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated header and version check for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily used for version validation and metadata declaration.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the airflow module (`__version__`) and the packaging library for version comparison.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Uses version data from `airflow.__version__` and the `packaging` library to compare versions and potentially raise an error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard version check and import statements. The `__version__` is hardcoded, which is typical for such files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a version string, and performs a version check to ensure compatibility with a specific Airflow version. The version comparison raises a RuntimeError if the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0. The file includes licensing and licensing notice comments, and a comment indicating automatic generation. All operations are standard, and no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated package header that performs a version check to ensure compatibility. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
