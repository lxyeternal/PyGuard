{
  "purpose": "This code sets up version compatibility checks and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it is used with a compatible version of Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported package 'packaging.version', the Airflow version from the '__version__' attribute, and a hardcoded string for the package version.",
  "targets": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is less than 2.9.0, which could potentially disrupt usage but is not malicious.",
  "flows": "The code parses the Airflow version and compares it to a minimum required version, raising an exception if the requirement isn't met.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code contains licensing comments, import statements, version parsing, and a straightforward version check and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily deals with license notices and version validation. It imports version parsing libraries and checks the current Airflow version against a minimum supported version, raising an exception if the condition is not met. No untrusted data input, network activity, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is structured for compatibility enforcement and licensing compliance.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, non-malicious code for managing package compatibility and licensing. It does not exhibit malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
