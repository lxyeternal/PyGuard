{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a version check and licensing header for a Python package related to Apache Airflow providers, specifically for Salesforce.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (__future__, packaging.version, airflow.__version__) and a string literal (__version__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted input leading to data leakage, system modification, or other malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The version string 'airflow_version' is parsed and compared against a hardcoded version '2.9.0'. If the installed Airflow version is older, it raises a RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs a straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard license header and a version check for compatibility. It imports necessary modules, retrieves the current Airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. If the condition fails, it raises an error. No data is sent over the network or stored maliciously. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign compatibility check and licensing header. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code.",
