{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be an auto-generated Python module used for version management and compatibility checks within an Apache Airflow provider package, specifically for Salesforce integration.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (`packaging.version` and `airflow.__version__`), reads `airflow_version` to perform version comparison.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads `airflow.__version__`, parses it, and raises an error if the version is below 2.9.0; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward version check; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The only noteworthy aspect is the enforcement of a minimum version requirement.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, defines a version string, and performs a version comparison to ensure compatibility. It raises an exception if the environment's Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is standard for dependency validation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is well-structured, commented, and adheres to typical Python practices for version checks. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and there are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign auto-generated version check script intended to enforce package compatibility requirements. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
