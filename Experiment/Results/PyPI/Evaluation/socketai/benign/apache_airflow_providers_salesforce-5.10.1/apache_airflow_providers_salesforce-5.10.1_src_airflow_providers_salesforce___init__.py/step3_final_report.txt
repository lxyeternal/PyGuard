  "purpose": "Dependency version enforcement for Apache Airflow provider package to ensure compatibility with Airflow >= 2.9.0.",
  "sources": "Reads 'airflow.__version__' to determine installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if version requirement is not met, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__ → Sink: raise RuntimeError if version < 2.9.0.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated header that imports 'packaging.version' and 'airflow.__version__', defines a version string, and compares the installed Airflow version to a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the installed version is below this, it raises a RuntimeError. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The logic is simple and intended for dependency validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in risk score (0.1) reflects operational impact potential but not security risk. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard dependency validation logic with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are accurate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the risk score should be 0, reflecting no security threat.",
