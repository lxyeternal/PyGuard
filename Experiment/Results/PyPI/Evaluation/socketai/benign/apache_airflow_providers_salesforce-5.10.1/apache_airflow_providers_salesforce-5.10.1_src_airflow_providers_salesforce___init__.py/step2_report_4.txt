  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, auto-generated header with a version check for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- The code reads the `airflow.__version__`, compares it to a minimum required version (2.9.0), and raises a RuntimeError if the environment does not meet this requirement.\n- No untrusted data input, external communication, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is consistent with typical dependency validation practices.\n- The scores assigned are predominantly 0 or very low, indicating minimal or no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The version check logic is straightforward and safe.\n- No signs of malware, malicious intent, or supply chain compromise are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are present.\n- The code's purpose and logic are clear and standard.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is not obfuscated.\n- The **security risk score** is very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, assigned in some reports for the potential impact of a version mismatch (which could disrupt functionality). This is reasonable but not indicative of a security threat.\n- Malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard version check.\n- No assumptions about malicious activity are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential operational disruption if version requirements are not met, but not a security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical auto-generated header with a version validation check.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code poses no security risk.",
