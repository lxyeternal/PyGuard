  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**  \n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated header performing version validation.  \n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.  \n   - The code imports standard modules, defines a version string, and performs a comparison, raising an exception if the environment does not meet the minimum version requirement.\n\n2. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are also 0, aligning with the clear, readable code.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Logic Flaws**  \n   - The only potential concern is the `RuntimeError` raised if the version check fails. However, this is standard practice for dependency validation and not malicious.  \n   - The reports assign a very low security risk (0.1), which is reasonable considering the version enforcement could disrupt functionality if misused, but it is not inherently dangerous.\n\n4. **Score Justification**  \n   - The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 or 0) are consistent with the code's nature.  \n   - Since the code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions**  \n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as a standard version check.  \n   - The only point of contention could be the `RuntimeError` which might disrupt usage but is a standard dependency enforcement measure, not malicious.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**  \n   - The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation.  \n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard dependency check, minimal risk, mainly operational disruption if version mismatch occurs)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical auto-generated dependency validation snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score around 0.1 to reflect potential operational impact but no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.  \n- The scores in the reports are appropriate and should not be increased.  \n- No further action needed.",
