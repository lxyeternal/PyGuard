{
  "purpose": "Provides static metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-salesforce' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a predefined dictionary; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present; the code does not handle or process external data.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, static, and straightforward with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning package metadata with no external input, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads. It is well-structured, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscation or secrets. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate. The only minor inconsistency is a report assigning a securityRisk of 0.1, which should be lowered to 0, given the benign static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores should be maintained at 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report can be corrected to reflect zero risk.",
