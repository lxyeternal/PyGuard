  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-salesforce' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data defined within the get_provider_info() function, including package info, version list, integration details, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not write data to external locations or perform untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "The function returns a static dictionary object; no dynamic data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated segments, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be auto-generated metadata with clear and standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static function that returns a predefined dictionary containing package metadata, including version info, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies. The data is hardcoded and well-structured. There are no dynamic inputs, network communications, or data processing logic that could be malicious. The comments indicate automatic generation and the licensing information is standard for open-source projects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code serves as configuration info without any code injection, credential handling, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, auto-generated metadata function providing package details. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and typical for package configuration files.",
