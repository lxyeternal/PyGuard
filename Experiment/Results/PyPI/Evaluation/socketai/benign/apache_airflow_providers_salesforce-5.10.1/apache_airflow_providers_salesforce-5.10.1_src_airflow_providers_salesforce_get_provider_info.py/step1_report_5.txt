  "purpose": "This code defines and returns metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-salesforce' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data embedded within the function, such as package info, version list, integration details, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used, as the data is hardcoded and static.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns a dictionary containing static data; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, auto-generated metadata with no dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning hardcoded package metadata, including version info, integrations, and dependencies. There is no data input, no processing of untrusted data, no external calls, or code execution based on user input. It appears to be an auto-generated, static metadata provider. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely provides package info as a dictionary, with no external data handling or insecure code elements.",
