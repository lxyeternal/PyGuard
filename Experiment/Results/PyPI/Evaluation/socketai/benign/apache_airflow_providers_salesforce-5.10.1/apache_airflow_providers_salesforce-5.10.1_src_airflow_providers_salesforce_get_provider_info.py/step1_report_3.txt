  "purpose": "The function get_provider_info returns metadata about the apache-airflow-providers-salesforce package, including version info, integrations, operators, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward static data return with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple function returning a dictionary with package metadata. It contains no user input handling, no external data sources, and no code that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. The structure is clear, static, and standard for metadata definition. There are no anomalies such as obfuscation or hidden code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata function providing package information. There are no security risks, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of the package's documentation or configuration.",
