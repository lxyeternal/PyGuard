  "purpose": "Implement an Airflow operator to perform Salesforce bulk API operations such as insert, update, upsert, delete, and hard delete, and optionally push results to XCom.",
  "sources": "Parameters: operation, object_name, payload, external_id_field, batch_size, use_serial, salesforce_conn_id; external libraries: SalesforceHook, dynamic attribute access via __getattr__.",
  "sinks": "Result of bulk API operation, optionally returned and pushed to XCom.",
  "flows": "Input parameters validated -> SalesforceHook connection established -> dynamic method call based on operation -> result obtained -> optionally returned and pushed to XCom.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of __getattr__ and cast is standard SDK pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Airflow operator for Salesforce bulk operations. It performs input validation, uses dynamic attribute access to call the appropriate bulk method, and interacts with external Salesforce SDKs in a standard manner. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious external calls are present. The only potential concern is the use of do_xcom_push, which could expose sensitive data if payloads contain confidential information, but this is a common pattern in Airflow and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's characteristics and potential data exposure risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an Airflow operator for Salesforce bulk API interactions. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The moderate security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the potential for data leakage via XCom, but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
