  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured tree visualization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscated logic. The only minor concern pertains to untrusted node attribute data, which could be exploited for misleading output but does not pose a security vulnerability. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a conservative security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate due to potential misuse of node data. Overall, it is safe for use in trusted environments with standard precautions regarding data validation."
