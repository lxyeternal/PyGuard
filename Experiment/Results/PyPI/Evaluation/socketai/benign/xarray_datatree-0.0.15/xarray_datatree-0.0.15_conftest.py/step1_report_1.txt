  "purpose": "Registering assertion rewriting for the 'datatree.testing' module in pytest to improve testing output.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pytest' and registration call for 'datatree.testing'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only registers a plugin hook.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, only involving standard pytest plugin registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest library and registers a rewrite rule for assertions from the 'datatree.testing' module. This is a common testing setup step and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. No input/output handling, no data manipulation, and no external communication are present. The code is minimal and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest setup step for assertion rewriting, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe and typical for test configurations.",
