  "purpose": "Register a rewrite hook for pytest assertions in the datatree.testing module",
  "sources": "Import statement for pytest and its assertion rewriting registration",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a registration call",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest module and registers a custom assertion rewriting for the 'datatree.testing' namespace. This is a standard testing configuration step and does not involve any untrusted data processing, network activity, or suspicious logic. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing solely on pytest configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard test configuration purpose without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
