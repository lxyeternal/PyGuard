{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for working with tree structures, including checking tree isomorphism, mapping functions over subtrees, and handling errors with context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include tree nodes, node attributes, datasets, and data arrays, primarily accessed via tree traversal methods like subtree iteration and node attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are function calls to user-defined functions (func), error handling that may manipulate exceptions, and data returns from mapped functions that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from tree node datasets into user-defined functions applied via map_over_subtree, and results are propagated back into new DataTree structures. Errors in mapping functions are caught and augmented with path context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscation, hidden network activity, or system manipulation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on structure verification, dataset mapping, and error handling within data trees. It verifies input types, ensures tree isomorphism, and applies functions in a structured manner. No suspicious data manipulation or network activity is present. The functions operate entirely on data structures and datasets, with no external communications or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for tree and dataset operations without any malicious intent. It performs tree structure checks, data mapping, and error augmentation securely. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
