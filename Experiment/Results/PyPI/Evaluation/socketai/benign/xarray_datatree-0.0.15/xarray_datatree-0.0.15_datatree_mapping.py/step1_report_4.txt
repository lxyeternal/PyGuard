{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for verifying structural isomorphism between tree data structures, mapping functions over subtrees, and error handling within a tree processing context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from DataTree instances, primarily through iteration over subtrees, attributes, and paths within nodes.",
  "sinks": "Results from functions applied to nodes (e.g., in map_over_subtree) are stored back into new DataTree instances; no external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input DataTree nodes are traversed; data from nodes is passed to user-defined functions; results are collected and reconstructed into new DataTrees, with exception handling adding context during errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code performs standard tree structure checks, mapping, and error handling. No obfuscated code or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structural comparisons between trees, mapping functions over subtrees, and robust error handling with context. It uses standard Python constructs, such as decorators, iteration, and exception handling, with no indications of malicious payloads or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are designed for safe data manipulation within a controlled environment, and no external network access or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a utility module for tree structure validation and mapping, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs expected operations for data validation and transformation without suspicious side effects.",
