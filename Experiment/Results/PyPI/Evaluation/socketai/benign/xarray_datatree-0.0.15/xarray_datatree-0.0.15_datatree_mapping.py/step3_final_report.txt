  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing, validating, and transforming tree structures (DataTree), including isomorphism checks, mapping functions over subtrees, and error handling.",
  "sources": "DataTree objects, node attributes, datasets within nodes, environment info (Python version).",
  "sinks": "Application of user-provided functions to datasets within nodes, which could be malicious if untrusted; results used to construct new DataTree instances.",
  "flows": "Data flows from node datasets into user functions, then results are collected and used to rebuild trees, potentially propagating malicious data if functions are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. The code performs standard validation, structural checks, and safe error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent utility for tree validation, mapping, and error handling. It relies on user-supplied functions, which pose a risk if untrusted, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic. No external communication or system modifications are present. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1), primarily due to executing external functions. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, safe utility module for tree data management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of user functions, which is outside the code's scope. Scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.1.",
