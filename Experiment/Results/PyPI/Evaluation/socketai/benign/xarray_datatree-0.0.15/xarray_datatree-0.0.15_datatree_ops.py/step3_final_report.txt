  "purpose": "Extends the xarray.Dataset class with methods that operate over subtrees by wrapping existing methods with map_over_subtree, enabling recursive hierarchical data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries, xarray.Dataset, and the local map_over_subtree function; reads method definitions from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs; methods invoke map_over_subtree internally to apply functions across data trees.",
  "flows": "Wraps Dataset methods with map_over_subtree, creating source-to-sink paths through method calls that operate on each node in a data hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected; straightforward pattern of method wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and mixins to attach Dataset methods that are mapped over subtrees, relying on map_over_subtree for recursive application. No external data, network, or system calls are present. The pattern is standard for hierarchical data processing extensions. The trustworthiness of map_over_subtree is a potential concern but outside the scope of this code snippet. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured extension pattern for xarray.Dataset, designed for recursive method application over data trees. The security risk is minimal if map_over_subtree is trusted; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
