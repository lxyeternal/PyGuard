  "purpose": "Define iterators for traversing a tree data structure in various strategies (pre-order and level-order).",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as `node`, `filter_`, and `stop` functions; methods reading `children` of nodes.",
  "sinks": "Yielding nodes, calling `filter_` and `stop` functions, recursive calls for tree traversal.",
  "flows": "Input node -> filtering/stop functions -> recursive traversal -> yielded nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code is a standard implementation of tree traversal algorithms. No data leakage, malicious side effects, or obfuscated code observed. The code relies on user-provided functions (`filter_`, `stop`) which could theoretically be malicious if provided malicious functions, but that is outside the scope of this review.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete classes for tree traversal iterators using standard patterns (pre-order and level-order). It uses well-known Python idioms and standard library features, with no suspicious imports or behavior. The functions `filter_` and `stop` are optional and user-defined, which could potentially be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. No network calls, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of tree traversal iterators with no malicious intent. It relies on user-supplied functions for filtering and stopping, which is normal. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks in the provided code. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming proper use of safe filter and stop functions.",
