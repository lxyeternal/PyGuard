  "purpose": "Assertion functions for comparing DataTree objects to verify structural and attribute equivalence during testing.",
  "sources": "In-memory DataTree objects, no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external communication, or processing of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Type checks and method calls on DataTree instances; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward type assertions and invokes comparison methods (`isomorphic`, `equals`, `identical`) on DataTree objects, optionally traversing to root nodes. It uses external functions for warnings and diff representations, but these are standard and trusted. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or external data handling. The functions are designed solely for internal testing assertions, raising exceptions on mismatches. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility for DataTree comparisons with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
