      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured tree visualization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscated logic. The only minor concern pertains to untrusted node attribute data, which could be exploited for misleading output but does not pose a security vulnerability. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a conservative security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate due to potential misuse of node data. Overall, it is safe for use in trusted environments with standard precautions regarding data validation."

The serialization and data access features are standard and do not pose significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The only potential risk stems from the use of user-supplied functions (`filter_`, `stop`), which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in secure environments, assuming external functions are trusted or validated."
