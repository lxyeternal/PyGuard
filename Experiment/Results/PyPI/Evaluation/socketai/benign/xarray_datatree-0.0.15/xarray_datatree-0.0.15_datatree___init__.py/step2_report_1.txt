  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard package initialization, imports, deprecation warning, version handling.\n- Source & Sink: No untrusted data involved; only internal imports and a warning.\n- Flow & Anomalies: Typical flow; no anomalies detected.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks; purely informational.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.0 (standard package setup, no security issues)  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, handling imports, warnings, version info.\n- Source & Sink: No external data or untrusted input; just internal operations.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; fallback version handling is standard.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity; safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to deprecation warning and version handling, but still very low risk)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, deprecation warning, version import.\n- Source & Sink: No external or untrusted data involved.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; standard practices.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar setup with deprecation warning and version handling.\n- Source & Sink: No external data or malicious code.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; standard pattern.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard module setup, deprecation warning, version fallback.\n- Source & Sink: No untrusted data or external network activity.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies detected.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious or security issues.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, involving imports, warnings, and version handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; primarily a deprecation notice and version fallback, which are benign.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and informational.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, mostly due to deprecation notice, but not a security concern)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and contains no security threats. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with no need for adjustments.",
