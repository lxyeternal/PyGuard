  "purpose": "Standard package initialization, imports, deprecation warning, version handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, warnings.warn, try-except block for version import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external input involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements and warning execution during module load; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practices for version fallback and deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, issuing a deprecation warning, and handling version info with a fallback. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The warning is informational, and the version import is a common pattern. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard package initialization script with an informational deprecation warning. The scores are appropriately zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal security risk score reflecting the deprecation notice's benign nature.",
