{
  "purpose": "This module provides imports and warnings related to the 'datatree' library, including deprecation notices and version handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data. It imports internal modules and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module import statements to issuing a deprecation warning and setting version information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The deprecation warning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, issues a deprecation warning about the repository's status, and attempts to import version info from a generated file, falling back to a default version if import fails. The warning message references external URLs but does not perform any network activity. The try-except block is standard for handling optional or generated files. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning, which is informational and does not pose security concerns.",
