  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external data, no data flows, no functions, or complex logic are present.\n- Comments warn against changing or tracking in version control, which is common practice but could be viewed as unusual; however, this alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The code is consistent across reports, and all conclude benignity.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code is straightforward and matches the original snippet.\n- No suspicious behavior, external communication, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious code.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical errors are evident.\n- They correctly identify that this is a benign version string assignment.\n- The mention of the comment as a red flag is noted but not a flaw; it is common in version files.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since no malicious behavior, data flow, or external communication is detected, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is plain and straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential claims based on assumptions:**\n- The comment about not changing or tracking in version control is not inherently suspicious; it could be a standard practice or an internal guideline.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is just a version string.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as benign, simple version declaration code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is harmless and standard practice in software projects. The comments are slightly unusual but not suspicious. The overall security risk remains negligible.",
