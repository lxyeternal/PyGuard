  "anomalies": "Minimal, as the code is a simple version declaration with no suspicious constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a string value to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. It does not perform any actions beyond setting a version identifier.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simply setting a version string with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
