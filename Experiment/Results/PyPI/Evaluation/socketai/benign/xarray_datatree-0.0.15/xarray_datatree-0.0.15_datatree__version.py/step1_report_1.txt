  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version identifier for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only a variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment instructing not to change or track in version control, which may be a red flag for intentional concealment or obfuscation intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version variable assignment with a comment. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or execute any logic that could be malicious. The comment indicates an instruction to prevent changes or tracking, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No other code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version indicator with an unusual comment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
