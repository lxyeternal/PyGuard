  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The comment about not changing or tracking in version control is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version string assignment with an accompanying comment. No dynamic logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns are present. The comment is slightly unusual but common in version files. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version marker. The comments are slightly unusual but not suspicious. The overall security risk is negligible, and no changes to the scores or further investigation are necessary.",
