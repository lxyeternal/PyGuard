  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is common in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited. The comment suggests not to track in version control, but this is benign and not suspicious. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
