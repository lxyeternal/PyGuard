      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for updating version information in a local file. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned scores accurately reflect the low threat level, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1. Overall, the script is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
