  "purpose": "Library for reading, modifying, and writing SSH configuration files, including handling includes and multiple configurations.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations (read_ssh_config_file, read_ssh_config, write, save methods), reading configuration lines, environment variables (not explicitly used), glob for include resolution.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (write, save), configuration modification methods, potential command execution is not present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from file reads (reading config files), through parsing and modification methods, to file write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard parsing and configuration management. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functionality for parsing, modifying, and saving SSH configuration files. It handles includes via glob pattern expansion. All file operations are straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent. No use of untrusted input sources for command execution or network communication. The methods operate on files, strings, and data structures without executing code from untrusted sources or transmitting data externally. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic aligns with normal configuration file handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard SSH configuration management library with no malicious behavior. It safely reads, modifies, and writes configuration files. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage. It’s suitable for its intended purpose without security concerns.",
