  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate SSH config library, handling parsing, modification, includes, and file operations. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — very low, considering the code performs standard file operations.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues detected. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard SSH config management, handling includes, parsing, and modifications. No suspicious activity, network, or secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No anomalies or malicious behavior. The scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SSH config library with parsing, modifications, and includes. No secrets, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very minimal, considering the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions and scores are consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; handles reading, editing, and writing SSH configs with include support. No malicious activity or secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate for a config management library.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis and scoring are aligned with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard file I/O, configuration parsing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as a benign SSH configuration management library.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None apparent. All reports are consistent in their reasoning and scoring.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate.\n- **Potential Malicious Behavior:** None detected or implied. The code only manipulates local files and configurations.\n- **Assumptions and Claims:** All reports base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, network activity, or secrets, which is justified.\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 — minimal, as the code deals with configuration files only.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe SSH configuration management library with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring — malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1.",
