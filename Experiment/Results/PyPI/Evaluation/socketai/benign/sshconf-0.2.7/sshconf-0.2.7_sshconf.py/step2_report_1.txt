  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate SSH config management library with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles reading, modifying, and writing SSH configs, including includes. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation. The risk score is 0.2, malware score 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is well-structured, and the operations are standard for configuration management. No suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Score justification**: Given the absence of malicious activity, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low, and the obfuscation is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1. The code reads, parses, modifies, and writes SSH configs. No suspicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning aligns with the code. The operations are standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Score justification**: Malware score remains 0. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code handles SSH configs safely. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation. It performs standard parsing and editing.\n\n- **Assessment**: The analysis is consistent with the code. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification**: Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Same conclusion. The code manages SSH configs securely, with no malicious features.\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is valid. No external or malicious activities.\n\n- **Score justification**: Malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as above. The code performs standard file I/O, parsing, and editing. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malware.\n\n- **Score justification**: Malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk scores**: Slight variation, but all are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — The code is a standard SSH config management library with no malicious features.\n\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score**: **0.1** — Slightly above zero due to file operations, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n**My final estimate**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a benign, purpose-built SSH configuration management library.",
