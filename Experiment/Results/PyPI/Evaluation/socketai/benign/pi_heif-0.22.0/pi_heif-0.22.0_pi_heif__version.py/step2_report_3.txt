  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: All reports describe the code as simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. The actual code is:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"Version of pi_heif/pi_heif.\"\"\"\n__version__ = \"0.22.0\"\n```\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - The code is minimal, with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.  \n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.  \n   - No anomalies or malicious activities are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis and Conclusions**:  \n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.  \n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, which is correct. The code is not obfuscated.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:  \n   - No issues are present in the code; the reports are consistent and accurate.  \n   - The scores are reasonable given the code content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - Since the code is only a version string, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.  \n   - No assumptions are made about hidden malicious behavior; the analysis is sound.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and reasoning.",
