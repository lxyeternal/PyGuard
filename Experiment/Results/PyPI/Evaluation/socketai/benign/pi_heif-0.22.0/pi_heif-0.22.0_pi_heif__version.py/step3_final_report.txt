  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no input, output, or external communication. It contains no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. The simplicity and clarity of the code support high confidence that it is benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string declaration with no security or malicious concerns. The reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.",
