  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code contains no input reading, data processing, external communication, or complex logic.\n   - The purpose is solely to declare the package version, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No report mentions any obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data, or data flows are present.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, aligning with typical package version definitions.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that there are no security risks or malicious behaviors.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n   - The securityRisk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of any security concerns.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the simplicity of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Recommendations**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & My Estimation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final conclusion**: The code is a standard version declaration with no security or malicious concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall risk is negligible, and the package version declaration poses no security threat.",
