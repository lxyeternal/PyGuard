  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The actual code snippet is:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"Version of pi_heif/pi_heif.\"\"\"\n     __version__ = \"0.22.0\"\n     ```\n   - This is a minimal, standard practice for Python packages, serving only as metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No input sources, data flows, sinks, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no logic beyond assigning a string.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Score Evaluation and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n     - This is correct; there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the code only sets a version string, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made, which is correct.\n   - No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security concerns. The reports correctly identify this.",
