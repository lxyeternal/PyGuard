{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to automatically register a HEIF image plugin for the Pillow library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'register_heif_opener' from a relative module '.as_plugin'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'register_heif_opener()', which likely modifies the Pillow library's plugin registry.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call registration function -> plugin registered in Pillow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and invokes it to register a plugin, which appears to be a legitimate extension mechanism for Pillow. No external network activity, no data leaks, and no malicious code are present. The simplicity suggests standard plugin registration without hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of registering a HEIF plugin for Pillow without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
