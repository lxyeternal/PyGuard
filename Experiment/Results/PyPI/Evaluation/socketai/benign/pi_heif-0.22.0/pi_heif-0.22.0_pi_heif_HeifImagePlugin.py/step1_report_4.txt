  "purpose": "Register a HEIF plugin for the Pillow library by importing and invoking a registration function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.as_plugin), invocation of register_heif_opener()",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import module -> call register_heif_opener()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, straightforward plugin registration; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module (.as_plugin) and executes a function intended to register a plugin. The function name suggests its purpose is to register a plugin for HEIF support in Pillow. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed. No external data sources, no sensitive data handling, and no obfuscated code are present. Since the module is local, it likely relies on a legitimate plugin implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple plugin registration for Pillow with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious setup snippet.",
