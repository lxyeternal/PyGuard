  "purpose": "Register a HEIF plugin for Pillow by importing and invoking a registration function.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.as_plugin' and call to 'register_heif_opener()'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import module -> call 'register_heif_opener()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward plugin registration with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and executes a registration function, which is a common pattern for plugin setup. No external data, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with standard extension practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1), reflecting minimal potential impact but acknowledging that plugin registration could influence application behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin registration snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and standard extension pattern.",
