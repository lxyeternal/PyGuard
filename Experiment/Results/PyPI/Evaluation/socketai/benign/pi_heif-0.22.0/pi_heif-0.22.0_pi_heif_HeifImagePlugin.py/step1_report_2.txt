  "purpose": "Automatically register a HEIF plugin for the Pillow library to enable HEIF image format support.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'register_heif_opener' from a relative module '.as_plugin'.",
  "sinks": "Function call to 'register_heif_opener()' which likely modifies Pillow's plugin registry.",
  "flows": "Import from '.as_plugin' -> call to 'register_heif_opener()' which registers the plugin.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and typical for plugin registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function intended to register a HEIF image plugin for Pillow and executes it. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behavior. The code simply registers a plugin, which is common in extensible libraries. The module import path is relative, suggesting it is part of a package or local codebase. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple plugin registration routine for Pillow's HEIF support, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
