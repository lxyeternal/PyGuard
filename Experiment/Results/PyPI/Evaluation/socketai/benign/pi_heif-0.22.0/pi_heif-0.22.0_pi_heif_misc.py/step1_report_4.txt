{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions and classes for processing HEIF/AVIF images, including reading metadata, managing image encoding, and handling image orientation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files, file-like objects, or bytes; accesses image info, metadata, and EXIF/XMP data; reads plugin files for libheif.",
  "sinks": "Writes image data and metadata to files or byte streams; modifies image EXIF and XMP tags; loads external plugins.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input sources; processes or modifies image metadata (exif, xmp); loads plugin files; writes image data, metadata, and files.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Functions handle image metadata securely. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of helper functions for image processing, metadata handling, and plugin loading in the context of HEIF/AVIF image encoding. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system damage commands. The plugin loader and image metadata functions operate on standard data and file inputs. The functions handle image orientation, metadata extraction, and plugin loading in a typical manner consistent with normal image processing workflows. No suspicious external calls, malicious code injections, or backdoors are present. Overall, the code is structured and written securely, focused on image handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for image processing and plugin loading, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
