  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HEIF/AVIF images, metadata, orientation correction, plugin loading, and encoding, primarily for internal use.",
  "sources": "File reads (_get_bytes), metadata extraction (_retrieve_exif, _retrieve_xmp), plugin loading (load_libheif_plugin), image data processing, and external C extension (_pi_heif).",
  "sinks": "Metadata manipulation (exif, xmp), image encoding/output, and plugin-based image processing.",
  "flows": "File or byte data -> metadata extraction -> orientation correction or metadata modification -> image encoding via external C module -> output or file write.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Plugin loading is a potential vector if untrusted plugins are used, but this is a standard feature.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard image processing utilities, including metadata handling, orientation correction, plugin management, and image encoding. It uses safe practices, with deferred plugin import and explicit plugin loading. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious routines are present. The plugin loading feature, while potentially risky if misused, is a controlled, common pattern. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for HEIF/AVIF image processing, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The existing scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is low (0.2) due to plugin loading, which is standard but warrants caution if plugins are untrusted.",
