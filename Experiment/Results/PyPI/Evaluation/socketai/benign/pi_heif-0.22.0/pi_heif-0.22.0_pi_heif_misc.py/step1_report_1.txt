{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for handling HEIF/AVIF image formats, including image encoding, metadata extraction, and orientation handling.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from file paths, file objects, or bytes; extracts EXIF and XMP metadata from images; reads input parameters for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Writes image data to files or file-like objects; updates EXIF and XMP metadata within image info; creates and encodes images for HEIF/AVIF formats.",
  "flows": "Source data (image bytes, file data, metadata) flows into functions that process or extract information; data is then passed into encoder methods which may write or modify image/metadata; final data output is saved to files or streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual code constructs; the code uses standard libraries and practices for image processing and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages image metadata, orientation, and encoding workflows. It safely handles file reading with support for file objects, bytes, and paths. Metadata extraction functions correctly identify and purge EXIF and XMP blocks. The image encoding class interacts with a C extension for HEIF/AVIF encoding, setting parameters and adding metadata securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for image processing, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard image utility module for handling HEIF/AVIF images, metadata, and orientation. There are no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs expected functions related to image processing and encoding without any suspicious activities.",
