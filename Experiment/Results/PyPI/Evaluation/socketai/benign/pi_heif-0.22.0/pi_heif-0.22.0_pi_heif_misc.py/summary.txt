  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for HEIF/AVIF image processing, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The existing scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is low (0.2) due to plugin loading, which is standard but warrants caution if plugins are untrusted."
