  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes standard image processing functions, metadata extraction, and orientation handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code for image handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, and malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, focusing on metadata and plugin interaction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of deferred import for optional plugin (_pi_heif). No embedded secrets or obfuscation. Functions handle data safely.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign image processing helper with standard plugin loading.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. Plugin loading is standard but could be risky if untrusted plugins are used, which is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focus on image encoding, metadata, and plugin loading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The plugin loading via `load_libheif_plugin()` could be risky if the plugin is malicious, but this is an explicit, controlled operation.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malware. The plugin loading is a potential vector but is a standard feature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity. The risk score is acceptable given the plugin loading feature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar image processing helpers, metadata handling, plugin loading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or secrets. The plugin loading is explicit and controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or behavior. The plugin loading could be risky if untrusted, but this is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — suitable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Helper functions for metadata, encoding, plugin loading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The dynamic plugin loading (`load_libheif_plugin`) is a potential concern if the plugin path is untrusted, but this is expected for plugin systems.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; standard image processing helpers.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.2) due to plugin loading, which could be risky if plugins are untrusted, but this is a normal feature and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering plugin loading, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured image processing utility module with no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
