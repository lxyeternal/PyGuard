{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve version and information details of the libheif library.",
  "sources": "Import of _pi_heif module; access to _pi_heif.get_lib_info() method",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if _pi_heif.get_lib_info() processes untrusted data or if DeferredError triggers unintended behavior, but no explicit sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import and exception handling flow to _pi_heif; functions calling _pi_heif.get_lib_info() to retrieve data",
  "anomalies": "Use of DeferredError to handle ImportError; no evidence of data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a private library _pi_heif; if unsuccessful, it assigns DeferredError to handle the exception. Functions simply call get_lib_info() to retrieve version data, which appears to be internal library functions. No external input processing, no data leaks, and no suspicious network activity are present. The exception handling mechanism is standard, and the functions merely return information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for retrieving version info of libheif, with standard error handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
