{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve version and information about the libheif library, likely for use in a larger image processing or media library.",
  "sources": "Imports _pi_heif module, which provides library info; potentially from an environment where _pi_heif is dynamically loaded or deferred.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is processed or sent out, no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Calls to _pi_heif.get_lib_info() serve as data sources, but their data is returned directly without further processing or external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code handles ImportError by substituting a DeferredError object; this pattern is common for deferred or optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a private module _pi_heif; if unavailable, it substitutes a DeferredError. The functions simply invoke get_lib_info() from _pi_heif to retrieve version info. No external data inputs or outputs, no suspicious operations, and no malicious behavior are evident. The use of deferred error handling suggests modular or optional dependency management rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for retrieving library version info with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. It appears safe and legitimate.",
