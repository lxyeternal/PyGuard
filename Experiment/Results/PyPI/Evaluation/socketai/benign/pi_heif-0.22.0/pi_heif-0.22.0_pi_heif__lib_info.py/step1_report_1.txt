{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve version and information about the 'libheif' library used in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for _pi_heif, and calls to _pi_heif.get_lib_info() within functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the version information, and data structures containing library info.",
  "flows": "Import and exception handling flow; functions call _pi_heif.get_lib_info() and return its results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of DeferredError class to handle ImportError; no evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a C extension '_pi_heif'. If unavailable, it uses a deferred error class to handle the import failure. Functions then call methods on _pi_heif to retrieve library version info. No data is transmitted externally, and no untrusted input handling or dangerous code patterns are present. The deferred error pattern is common and not suspicious. The code's purpose is purely informational. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign implementation for retrieving library version info, with standard error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
