{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve version information of the underlying libheif library and its related components.",
  "sources": "Import of the _pi_heif module, which is used to access library information via get_lib_info() method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being sent over network, written to disk, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "Calling libheif_version() or libheif_info() retrieves data from _pi_heif.get_lib_info() without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code handles ImportError by substituting a DeferredError, which suggests deferred error handling, but no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a potentially optional or platform-specific module _pi_heif. If unavailable, it substitutes with a DeferredError class. The functions simply call get_lib_info() on the _pi_heif object, returning version info as string or dictionary. No external input, user data, or untrusted sources are involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data handling. The error handling approach with DeferredError is standard for optional dependencies.\n\nOverall, the code performs a benign task of retrieving library version info, with proper error handling, and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for fetching version information of the libheif library. It does not exhibit malicious intent, nor does it perform any suspicious or malicious actions. The use of DeferredError for missing modules is a standard pattern. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
