  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve version and information about the libheif library.",
  "sources": "Import of _pi_heif module, which is used to get library information.",
  "sinks": "The functions call _pi_heif.get_lib_info() which retrieves library info; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves calling _pi_heif.get_lib_info() to obtain version data; no untrusted input flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses DeferredError to handle ImportError, which is a common pattern; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a C extension module '_pi_heif'. If the import fails, it assigns a DeferredError instance, possibly deferring error reporting. The functions 'libheif_version' and 'libheif_info' call a method 'get_lib_info()' on _pi_heif, which is presumed to return static or internally managed data about the library version and details. No untrusted input, network operations, or data leaks are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The handling of import failure with DeferredError suggests a standard error management pattern rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for retrieving library version info, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages import errors and provides read-only information about the library. Overall, it appears benign.",
