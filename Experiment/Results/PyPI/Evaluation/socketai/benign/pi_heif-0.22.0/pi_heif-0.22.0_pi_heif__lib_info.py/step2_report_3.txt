  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and my own reasoning.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports a private extension `_pi_heif`.\n- If import fails, it assigns a `DeferredError` object.\n- Functions `libheif_version()` and `libheif_info()` call `_pi_heif.get_lib_info()` to retrieve version info.\n- The code is purely informational, with standard error handling.\n- No data is transmitted externally, no user input is processed, and no malicious code is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code appears correct and benign.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- **Error handling:** Uses a standard pattern with `DeferredError`.\n- **Data flow:** Internal, static info retrieval.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 3\n- All consistently describe the code as straightforward, benign, with standard error handling.\n- They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- Their confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Malware scores:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** These reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk (0.1).\n- Mentions potential concern if `_pi_heif.get_lib_info()` processes untrusted data or if `DeferredError` triggers unintended behavior.\n- **However:** The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network/file operations.\n- The use of `DeferredError` is a standard pattern, not suspicious.\n- The report does not specify any actual vulnerability or malicious activity, just potential concerns that are unfounded here.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but still reasonable. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified given the benign code.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Similar to others, with a detailed explanation.\n- Notes the import failure handling and the functions' simplicity.\n- Assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- The malware score remains 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or very close to it; the minor 0.1 reflects cautious acknowledgment that error handling patterns could be misused in malicious contexts, but here they are standard.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard error handling, no external data processing)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The analysis aligns with the code and the reports.",
