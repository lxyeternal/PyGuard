  "purpose": "Functions to retrieve version information of the libheif library, handling optional dependency import errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for _pi_heif, and the get_lib_info() method called within functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows to assignment of DeferredError or _pi_heif, then get_lib_info() outputs are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and function calls, standard error handling with DeferredError.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a private extension module, handling failure with DeferredError. The functions simply call get_lib_info() on the module or DeferredError instance. No external data, network activity, or user input processing occurs. The pattern is standard for optional dependencies. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and the error handling is conventional. Given the benign nature, the potential for malicious activity is negligible. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for the hypothetical concern if get_lib_info() were malicious, but there's no evidence of that. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for retrieving library version info with standard error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified as a cautious estimate, but the actual risk is negligible.",
