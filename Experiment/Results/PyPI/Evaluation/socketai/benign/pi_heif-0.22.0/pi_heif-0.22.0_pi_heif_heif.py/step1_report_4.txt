{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions for reading, writing, and manipulating HEIF/AVIF images, including integration with Pillow and support for multiple image types within HEIF containers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file objects, byte streams, and Pillow Image objects; data is read from files, bytes, and images for processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing image data to files or file-like objects, especially in the '_encode_images' and 'save' methods, which handle raw image data and metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, bytes, images) through decoding functions into internal representations, then possibly to encoding functions that write data back to files or streams.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or misleading code structures. The use of a deferred import for '_pi_heif' could delay error reporting but is not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured library for handling HEIF images, integrating with Pillow and supporting various image formats and metadata. It safely manages image data, metadata, and auxiliary images. No code injections, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious network activities are present. The deferred import of '_pi_heif' is a common pattern for optional C extension modules and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or privacy violations are detected. The image processing functions handle raw data and metadata in standard ways, with no evident malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured library for HEIF image processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its design focuses on image decoding, encoding, and metadata handling in a controlled manner. The deferred import pattern is typical for optional extensions and does not raise security concerns.",
