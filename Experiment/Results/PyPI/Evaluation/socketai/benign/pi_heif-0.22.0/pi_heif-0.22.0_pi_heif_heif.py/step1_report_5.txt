{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to read, write, and manipulate HEIF/AVIF image files, including conversion from Pillow images and raw bytes, as well as container management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file objects, byte streams, and Pillow Image objects; reading from files and byte buffers.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to file-like objects via save and encode functions; image data is processed and potentially stored or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data (files or bytes) -> loaded into internal image objects -> processed or converted -> saved or output as bytes or Pillow images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network connections are present. No unusual code or obfuscation detected. Use of optional deferred import for _pi_heif, which may delay error handling, is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python modules and a native extension _pi_heif for image processing, with fallback error handling. It manages image data flow between various formats and container objects. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system tampering. Functions for encoding, decoding, and image conversion are typical for image processing libraries. The use of deferred error for missing _pi_heif module is a common pattern, not malicious. The code's logic aligns with legitimate image handling functionalities without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image processing library for HEIF/AVIF formats with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It primarily handles image data in standard ways, with no network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
