  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code implements a standard image processing library for HEIF/AVIF formats.\n- It relies on an external native extension `_pi_heif`, with fallback to a deferred error class if missing.\n- It handles image loading, saving, metadata (EXIF, XMP), auxiliary images, and conversion with Pillow.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The data flows are typical for image processing libraries, with data being read from files/bytes, decoded, manipulated, and saved.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of malicious code?** No. The code is straightforward, handling images, metadata, and external library calls.\n- **Use of `_pi_heif`?** Yes, as expected for performance-critical native extensions. The fallback to `DeferredError` is standard.\n- **Data exfiltration or network activity?** No. No network code or suspicious data leaks are present.\n- **Obfuscation or dynamic code?** No. The code is clear and structured.\n- **Credentials or secrets?** No. No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- **Malicious operations?** No. No code that executes arbitrary commands, modifies system files, or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the report scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign **0** to malware, citing no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The only external component `_pi_heif` is a native extension, which could theoretically be malicious, but is standard practice for performance.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign **0**, correctly noting no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- The code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- The risk scores are mostly around **0.1–0.2**, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- Given the code's purpose, no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent.\n- The only concern could be the optional external library, but its absence or presence does not introduce risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score should stay low, around **0.1–0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0, because there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, because the code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2, as the main potential concern is the external native extension, which is a standard dependency and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1**  \n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe supply chain risk from this code is minimal. The reliance on `_pi_heif` is standard for performance but does not introduce malicious risk, especially given the fallback. The overall security posture is sound, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
