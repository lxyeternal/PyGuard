  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides classes/functions for HEIF/AVIF images, metadata, auxiliary images, and external library `_pi_heif`. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code handles image data securely, with standard import fallback via `DeferredError`. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is low (0.1). Obfuscated is 0. The logic is straightforward, purpose-driven, and does not contain suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing image reading/writing, metadata, and external dependencies. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Standard image processing workflows, safe use of external libraries with fallback, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware remains at 0, security risk low (0.2). Obfuscated is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on image input/output, metadata, and external library `_pi_heif`. No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Assessment:** Typical image processing functions, with proper validation and safe external library handling.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score of 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard image handling with external dependencies.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score of 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard image processing with external library `_pi_heif`. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Typical data flows, safe handling, no network or credential handling.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score of 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None observed. The code is a typical image processing library for HEIF/AVIF formats.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **External library `_pi_heif`:** Used as intended, with fallback for missing library, which is standard practice.\n- **Data flows:** All are confined to image data, metadata, and file I/O, with no evidence of data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about unsafe operations. The code validates inputs, handles exceptions, and manages data securely.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, mostly due to external dependencies and standard processing.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven image processing library with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It handles images, metadata, and auxiliary data securely, relying on external libraries in a standard manner. The overall supply chain security posture appears sound.",
