{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for reading, writing, and processing HEIF/AVIF images, including metadata and auxiliary images, relying on external native extension _pi_heif.",
  "sources": "File or byte input streams, external _pi_heif library for decoding/encoding, metadata extraction functions.",
  "sinks": "Decoded image data, metadata, saved image files, output streams.",
  "flows": "Input files/bytes -> decode via _pi_heif -> internal data structures -> output or save.",
  "anomalies": "Use of DeferredError for missing _pi_heif is standard fallback; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks with proper validation, safe external dependency handling, and no signs of malicious behavior. No network activity, credential handling, or code injection observed. Data flows are typical for image libraries, and fallback mechanisms are standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven image processing library for HEIF/AVIF formats, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected.",
