{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to handling HEIF/AVIF image formats, providing functions, constants, and classes for image processing and plugin registration.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (options, _lib_info, _version, as_plugin, constants, heif, misc); functions and classes imported from these modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or output; no network, file system, or environment variable operations shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; code only imports and exposes functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code strictly consists of import statements and function/class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and functions related to image processing, plugin registration, constants, and utility functions. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could lead to security issues. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module aggregation file, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module aggregation and import setup for an image processing library. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks based solely on these import statements and constants. It appears safe.",
