{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to handling HEIF/AVIF images, providing functions, constants, and classes for image processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and submodules such as options, _lib_info, _version, as_plugin, constants, heif, and misc.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no code that writes data to external systems or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports suggest data flows within the package modules, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated constructs; all imports are standard, and functions/variables appear related to image processing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs module imports, bringing in functions, classes, constants, and variables for internal use within a package. It does not execute any code beyond imports, nor does it include dynamic code execution, network activity, or file manipulation beyond what might be called within the imported modules. The imports are from local modules, likely part of the same package, indicating standard package structure. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware are present. The structure and content suggest a well-organized image processing library without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements from internal modules, likely part of an image processing library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a package that manages HEIF/AVIF images.",
