  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various functions, classes, and constants related to HEIF image processing, including plugin registration, image handling, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and specific functions/classes/constants from the current package and its submodules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data identified; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are evident in this snippet; primarily import statements",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; all imports are standard for a Python package dealing with image formats",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, importing classes, functions, and constants related to HEIF image handling. No code execution, user input handling, or data processing is present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident. All imports appear standard and relevant for image processing functionality. The structure suggests this is a library module, not a malicious or obfuscated script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a straightforward import section from a package dealing with HEIF images. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
