{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to HEIF/AVIF image formats, providing functions, constants, and classes for handling these formats.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from the same package (relative imports), which are sources for code execution and data flow.",
  "sinks": "Function calls like encode, from_bytes, from_pillow, open_heif, read_heif, get_file_mimetype, load_libheif_plugin, set_orientation potentially process untrusted data or trigger external actions.",
  "flows": "Data from external input (e.g., files, byte streams) may be processed by functions like from_bytes, open_heif, read_heif, which then use internal functions like encode or load_libheif_plugin, potentially leading to data exposure or system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual coding patterns are evident. The import statements and functions are standard for a media handling library.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of import statements importing classes, functions, and constants from local modules. No executable code or dynamic behavior is present. The functions imported suggest image processing, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or suspicious constructs. All imports appear standard for a multimedia processing library. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors are present. The presence of functions like load_libheif_plugin and set_orientation indicates functionality for handling image formats and metadata, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization or interface definition for an image processing library, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It mainly facilitates image format support and processing.",
