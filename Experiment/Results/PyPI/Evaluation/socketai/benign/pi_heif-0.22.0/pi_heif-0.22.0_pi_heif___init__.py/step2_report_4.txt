  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as part of an image processing package, with imports from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or flows are evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is just import statements, with no dynamic or malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious behavior.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly above zero, perhaps indicating minimal risk due to import complexity, but overall negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, straightforward module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard import setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — correct.  \n- Malware: 0.0 — accurate.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — aligns with the absence of risky operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, just imports.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- No dynamic code or external data handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same as above, purely import statements.\n- No code execution or external interactions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — fitting.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report notes functions like `encode`, `from_bytes`, `open_heif`, etc., which *could* process external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** These functions *may* process untrusted input, but the code snippet itself only shows import statements.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The functions imported are standard for image processing. While they could process untrusted data elsewhere, this code snippet does not execute any such processing.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious code detected here.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — perhaps reflecting the potential risk in the functions imported, but since no data is processed here, this is conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily import statements from local modules, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's static nature.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward imports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — a very conservative estimate, acknowledging that if functions like `encode` or `open_heif` are called with untrusted data elsewhere, risks could exist, but not from this code snippet itself.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, standard, and benign.",
