{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an import module aggregating internal components related to HEIF/AVIF image processing, facilitating access to classes, functions, and constants for the package.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports such as options, libheif info, version, image file classes, constants, and utility functions; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import statements without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, establishing namespace and access points for package components. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data processing occurs here. The functions imported could process untrusted data if invoked elsewhere, but this snippet does not execute any such functions. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a Python package's initialization or module aggregation file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard import module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks evident in its static structure. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential if imported functions are misused elsewhere, but the code itself is safe.",
