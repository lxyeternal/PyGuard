  "purpose": "Configuration options for the pi_heif library to customize runtime behavior, encoding, decoding, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, string literals, and configuration dictionaries; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no data output or external system interaction points identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are set statically; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of configuration options for the pi_heif library, including adjustable parameters for threading, image support features, encoding quality, and security settings. There are no functions, external data processing, or code execution flows. All options are documented with usage notes and are intended for user configuration during library registration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious code behavior are present. The security-related option 'DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS' could be risky if misused but is a documented feature of the underlying library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration module providing adjustable parameters for a library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware indicators. The presence of a security-limiting option warrants caution but is a documented feature. Overall, the code appears benign with no security risks or malicious intent.",
