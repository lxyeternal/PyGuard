  "purpose": "Configuration options for the runtime behavior of the pi_heif library, including image processing settings and encoder/decoder preferences.",
  "sources": "None; this code consists of configuration variables and comments, no data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written or transmitted, nor are there any data leak points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing logic is present, only static configuration assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all variables are standard configuration parameters with descriptive comments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides configuration variables for image processing options and format handling in the pi_heif library. It includes settings for thread usage, image support options, quality settings, bit-depth options, header handling, profile saving, encoder/decoder preferences, and security limits. All variables are straightforward, with no user input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code constructs. The comments clarify their purpose and usage. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads within this configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for the pi_heif image processing library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no data exfiltration or harmful actions. The variables are standard and well-documented, serving only to control library behavior.",
