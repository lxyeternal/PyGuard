  "purpose": "Configuration options to modify the runtime behavior of the pi_heif library for image processing.",
  "sources": "All configuration variables (e.g., DECODE_THREADS, THUMBNAILS, etc.) that are set at the module level.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code primarily sets parameters for image processing behavior.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code only defines configuration options without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The parameters are standard configuration options, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides configurable options for the pi_heif image processing library. It sets various parameters such as thread count, thumbnail support, depth and auxiliary image support, quality settings, and encoder/decoder preferences. All variables are plain data assignments with descriptive comments. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or input/output operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The option to disable security limits (DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS) could be risky if enabled maliciously, but as provided, it is set to False by default. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward configuration code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of configuration settings for the pi_heif library without any executable or data processing code. It contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The presence of a security limit disabling option should be noted, but it is not actively used here. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
