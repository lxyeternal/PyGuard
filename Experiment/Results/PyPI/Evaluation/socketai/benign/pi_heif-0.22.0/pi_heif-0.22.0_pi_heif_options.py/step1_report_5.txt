  "purpose": "Configuration options to customize the runtime behavior of the pi_heif library for image processing.",
  "sources": "All configuration variables are set within the script; no external data inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "These options influence the image encoding/decoding process, but do not directly handle untrusted data flows or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident in the code.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are simple configuration flags or parameters; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of configuration variables with accompanying comments explaining their purpose and usage. The variables control aspects such as threading, image support features, encoding quality, and security limits. No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The options align with typical configuration patterns for a media processing library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The presence of a security override variable (DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS) should be noted, but it is a configurable setting rather than malicious code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for the pi_heif image processing library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides adjustable parameters for runtime behavior but does not perform any data processing or external interactions that could be exploited maliciously.",
