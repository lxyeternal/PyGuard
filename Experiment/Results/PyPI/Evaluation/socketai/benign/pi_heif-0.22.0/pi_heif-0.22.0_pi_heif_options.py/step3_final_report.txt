  "purpose": "Configuration options for pi_heif's runtime behavior, including decoding, encoding, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables such as DECODE_THREADS, THUMBNAILS, DEPTH_IMAGES, AUX_IMAGES, QUALITY, SAVE_HDR_TO_12_BIT, ALLOW_INCORRECT_HEADERS, SAVE_NCLX_PROFILE, PREFERRED_ENCODER, PREFERRED_DECODER, DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "N/A; all variables are static configuration parameters without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The variable DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS could potentially weaken security if enabled, but it is a documented, optional setting. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of configuration variables with descriptive comments, intended for adjusting pi_heif's runtime behavior. No executable code, data processing, or dynamic logic is present. The only notable point is the DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS flag, which could be misused to bypass security measures if enabled, but as it is set to False, it does not pose an immediate threat. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to the potential misuse of the security override variable. The overall assessment confirms that the code is safe and primarily a configuration template.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script with no malicious intent. The only minor security consideration involves the DISABLE_SECURITY_LIMITS variable, which could be exploited if misused, but in its current state, it does not pose a threat. The reports' scores are consistent with this analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
