  "purpose": "Register an AVIF plugin for Pillow by importing and invoking a registration function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import from .as_plugin module; calling register_avif_opener()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call register_avif_opener()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard plugin registration snippet. It imports a function from a local module and executes it to register an AVIF plugin for Pillow. No malicious activity, network activity, or data leakage is evident. The trustworthiness depends on the local module, but the snippet itself is benign. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign plugin registration pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
