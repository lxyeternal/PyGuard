  "purpose": "Automatically registers an AVIF plugin for Pillow image processing library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package/module; function call to register the plugin.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or handle input/output directly.",
  "flows": "Import loads module functionality, register_avif_opener() registers plugin functionality internally within the Pillow ecosystem.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no external network activity, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing a function to register a plugin for Pillow. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The module appears to be designed solely for plugin registration, which is standard for extending Pillow's capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate plugin registration with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It is a typical extension registration pattern with no suspicious behavior.",
