  "purpose": "Auto-register an AVIF plugin for Pillow image processing library",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'register_avif_opener' from a local module '.as_plugin'",
  "sinks": "Function call to 'register_avif_opener()' which may register a plugin handler",
  "flows": "Import source -> function call to 'register_avif_opener()'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. The module imported is local, with a straightforward registration call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local module and immediately calls it to register an AVIF plugin with Pillow. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The purpose appears to be benign plugin registration. Since the imported module is local, its safety depends on its implementation, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to register an image plugin for Pillow. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard plugin registration snippet.",
