  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script is a standard build configuration for 'pillow-heif', reading environment variables, filesystem, and system commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks; subprocess calls are for configuration, not malicious code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns. Uses typical build steps.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script; minimal security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior) — reasonable.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Builds 'libheif' extension, reads environment variables, filesystem, subprocess outputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls ('brew', 'xcrun') are standard; copying system files could be risky if environment is malicious, but typical in build scripts.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no network activity. Uses subprocesses for configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard build script; no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given environment reliance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, platform-specific setup, environment variables, system commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess, filesystem; no dangerous data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard build steps.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Extensive environment and system checks for building 'libheif'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess and filesystem operations; no injection or exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, minimal security concern.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dependency and platform-specific setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard build procedures; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid build script, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports describe standard build scripts with typical environment and system command usage.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns:** No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern is reliance on environment variables and subprocess outputs, which is common but could be exploited if the environment is malicious. However, there's no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0.1 - 0.2** |\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, inherent to build scripts relying on environment variables and system commands, but no active threat.\n\n**Note:** The scores given in the reports are reasonable and align with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured build script for a Python extension module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The potential security risks are inherent to build scripts that rely on environment variables and system commands but are not malicious in nature.",
