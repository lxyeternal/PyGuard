  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the script is a standard build configuration with no malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors. It notes the code performs environment inspection, system command invocation, filesystem checks, and configuration setup, all typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's role in dependency detection and build setup. It highlights subprocess calls ('brew', 'xcrun') and file copying but finds no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score than Report 1, possibly due to the use of subprocess and file copying, but still reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes platform-specific setup, subprocess calls, environment variables, and filesystem checks. It notes that no malicious behavior or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments; the risk score remains low, reflecting the standard build script activities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on environment variables, subprocess commands, and filesystem operations. It states no malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The activities are typical for build scripts, and no malicious indicators are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirming the script's purpose as a dependency and platform-specific build configuration. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Justification:** Completely aligns with a benign build script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The script performs environment detection, filesystem checks, and subprocess calls for configuration, all standard and non-malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is reasonable. The main concerns are the use of subprocess and environment variables, which are typical in build scripts but could be misused if environment is malicious. However, given the context, the low scores are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, reflecting standard build complexity but low threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured build script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, and no changes are necessary.",
