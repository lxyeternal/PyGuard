  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for pillow-heif, handling dependencies, platform-specific configurations, and environment variables.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, subprocess calls are typical, no data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (negligible).\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as a standard build script with minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency detection, environment variables, and system commands.\n- **Findings:** Uses subprocess calls ('brew', 'xcrun'), copies system files without validation, but these are standard in build scripts.\n- **Potential concerns:** Copying files could be risky if malicious libraries are present, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; standard build process.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on platform-specific setup, environment variables, and system commands.\n- **Findings:** Uses subprocess, environment variables, and filesystem checks; no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Standard build script, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed environment and system info retrieval.\n- **Findings:** Uses subprocess, environment variables, filesystem checks; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the script as a typical build configuration for a C extension.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard subprocess usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully legitimate build script.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Standard environment and subprocess calls, typical for build scripts, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to environment-dependent behavior, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — negligible, standard build script behavior.\n\n**Note:** The script performs environment checks, subprocess calls, and filesystem operations typical for build scripts. No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or data exfiltration are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured build setup for a Python extension module, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the script is benign and typical for its purpose.",
