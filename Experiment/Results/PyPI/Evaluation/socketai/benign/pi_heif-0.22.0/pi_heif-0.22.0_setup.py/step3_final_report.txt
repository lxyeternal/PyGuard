  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the pillow-heif Python extension, handling dependency detection, platform-specific setup, and environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (e.g., '_version.py', include directories), environment variables (e.g., 'PKG_CONFIG', 'CFLAGS', 'CPPFLAGS', 'LDFLAGS', platform-specific paths), subprocess commands ('pkg-config', 'brew', 'xcrun'), and file operations (copying system libraries).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess outputs used for configuration, filesystem operations (copying files), environment variables influencing build paths, and include directory searches.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess commands provide configuration data; filesystem checks locate headers and libraries; the build process uses this data to compile extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious patterns. Use of subprocess for environment detection and copying system libraries is standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, platform-specific setup, and dependency configuration using standard subprocess calls, environment variables, and filesystem checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The subprocess calls are used for configuration purposes, not malicious activity. The copying of system libraries is typical in build environments. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to common build script practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for the pillow-heif extension, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified given its purpose and behavior.",
