It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal, estimated at 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of SDK wrapper code."

The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The risk score could be conservatively set at 0 or 0.1; given the nature of the code, 0 is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
