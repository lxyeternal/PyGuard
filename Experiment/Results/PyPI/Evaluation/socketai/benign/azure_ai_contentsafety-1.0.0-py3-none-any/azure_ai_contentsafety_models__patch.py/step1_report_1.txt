  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or stub for customizing SDK-generated Python code, specifically related to Azure SDK customization.",
  "sources": "There are no input or data sources; the code only contains import statements, variable definitions, and a function definition without any data reading or external input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could be leaked or malicious actions performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code does not process or transfer data, nor does it invoke any external functions or perform I/O.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and appears to be a boilerplate template with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard template with no functional logic beyond defining an empty list and a stub function. It includes a licensing comment, a docstring, and a function intended for SDK customization. There are no data inputs, outputs, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a placeholder for further customization. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
