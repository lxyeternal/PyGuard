  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, boilerplate or template code intended for SDK customization.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The code contains only licensing comments, an import statement, an `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` meant for user customization.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any functional or security issues. It is a benign, standard template.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, reflecting no security risk, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Score:\n- The code is purely a placeholder with no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Claims about vulnerabilities:\n- All reports correctly challenge any assumptions of vulnerabilities, stating that the code is benign and serves as a template.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward SDK customization scaffold with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe and benign.",
