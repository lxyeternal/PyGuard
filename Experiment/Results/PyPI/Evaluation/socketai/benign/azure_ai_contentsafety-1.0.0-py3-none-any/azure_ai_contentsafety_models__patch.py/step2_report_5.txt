  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal template or scaffold for customizing SDK-generated Python code, specifically for Azure SDKs.\n   - It contains:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - A module-level `__all__` list, currently empty.\n     - A `patch_sdk()` function intended for user customizations.\n   - No data inputs, outputs, external data sources, or processing are present.\n   - No network, file, or system calls are made.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Considerations**:\n   - The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for further customization.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is a standard extension point, not executing any code by itself.\n   - The code does not process or leak data, nor does it perform any I/O operations.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All five reports consistently identify the code as a benign, minimal SDK template with no malicious intent.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, sources, anomalies, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - The obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - The overall security risk scores are correctly 0.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**Conclusion & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign SDK customization scaffold.\n- No malicious or security-sensitive elements are present.\n- The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My personal estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
