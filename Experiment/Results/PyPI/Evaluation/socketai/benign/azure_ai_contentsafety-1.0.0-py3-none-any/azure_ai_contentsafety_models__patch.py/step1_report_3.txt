{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or scaffold for customizing generated code in an SDK, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "The code sources include the import statement for List from typing and the module's own comments and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process any data or execute any operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code mainly defines a function with a placeholder comment, without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, intentionally generic template for SDK customization. It contains standard licensing comments, an import statement, a public interface list, and a function docstring. There are no data sources or sinks, no input handling, and no operations that could be malicious. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or privilege escalations. It appears to be part of a larger generated SDK codebase and is unlikely to be malicious based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK customization scaffold with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard template that allows for future customizations without containing any executable malicious logic.",
