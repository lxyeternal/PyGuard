{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a template or customization point for modifying generated SDK code, primarily to add custom behavior or objects to the package.",
  "sources": "No data input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, network calls, or external effects within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual logic. The only notable aspect is the presence of a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` intended for user customization, which is standard for SDK customization points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple template for SDK customization, containing a license comment, a docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a function `patch_sdk()` meant for user modifications. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, or obfuscated code. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for customization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless SDK customization template with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious or malicious logic and serves as a placeholder for user modifications.",
