  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization. There are no signs of data processing, external data sources, network activity, or any operations that could be malicious. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is a placeholder with no functional logic beyond defining an empty list and a stub function. No errors or flaws are apparent, and the code's simplicity aligns with its purpose as a template.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:**  \n     All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   \n   - **Obfuscated Score:**  \n     All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n   \n   - **Risk Score:**  \n     The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified since the code is a benign placeholder with no security risks.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is a template for customization with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the code's nature, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**  \n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard SDK customization scaffold with no security concerns.**",
