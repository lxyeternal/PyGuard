  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated code in a Python SDK, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDKs, allowing users to modify or extend the SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward template with no suspicious or unusual constructs; it contains only comments, import statements, and a function definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of comments, licensing information, and a function intended for SDK customization. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The function `patch_sdk` is a placeholder for user modifications and does not perform any actions in its current state. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could indicate malicious activity. The code adheres to standard practices for SDK customization and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign template for customizing an SDK with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
