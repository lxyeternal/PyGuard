  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically to confirm the findings and assess the scores:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows involving external or untrusted data.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network operations.\n- The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user customization, not performing any actions in its current state.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or I/O.\n- The structure is standard for SDK customization points.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Correct, the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — Correct, no malicious behavior or code is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — Correct, the code is benign, serving as a placeholder.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \nGiven the evidence, no. The code is purely a benign template with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (obfuscated: 0, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment, and no further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard SDK customization template with no security concerns. The provided scores and reasoning are accurate and justified.",
