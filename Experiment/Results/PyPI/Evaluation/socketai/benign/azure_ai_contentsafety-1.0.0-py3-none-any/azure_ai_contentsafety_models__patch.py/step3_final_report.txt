{
  "purpose": "Template for SDK customization, allowing users to modify or extend generated code as needed.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code contains only comments, import statements, and a placeholder function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is static with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for SDK customization points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, minimal scaffold intended for user customization in SDK development. It contains licensing comments, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk()' with no operational logic. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code does not include hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All indicators point to a safe, transparent template designed solely for extension, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK customization scaffold with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
