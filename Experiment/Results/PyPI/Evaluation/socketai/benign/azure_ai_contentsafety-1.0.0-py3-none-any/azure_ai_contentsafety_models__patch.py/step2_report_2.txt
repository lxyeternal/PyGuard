  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, benign template intended for SDK customization.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The code contains only comments, an import statement, an empty list, and a placeholder function.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n**1. Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with malware scores at 0.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs.\n- The function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder for user customization, not executing any malicious logic.\n\n**2. Data flow, sinks, sources:**\n- No data sources or sinks are present.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or I/O operations.\n\n**3. Logical errors or anomalies:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- The only notable feature is the placeholder function, which is standard for SDK customization points.\n\n**4. Scores assessment:**\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**5. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Not applicable; all scores are 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n| Issue Aspect          | Assessment                                              | Recommended Score(s) | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware               | No malicious code present                                | 0                    | No malware or malicious behavior detected                          |\n| Obfuscated            | Clear, straightforward code                               | 0                    | No obfuscation; code is transparent                                |\n| Security Risk         | No security-sensitive operations or data handling        | 0                    | No security risks; placeholder code                                |\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a benign, minimal SDK customization scaffold.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard SDK template with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as reported.",
