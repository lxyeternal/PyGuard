  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code defines two abstract base classes (`ContentSafetyClientMixinABC` and `BlocklistClientMixinABC`) for internal use within an SDK.\n   - These classes contain only type annotations and class attribute declarations.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or runtime logic.\n   - Comments clearly indicate these classes are for internal typing and structure, not for external use.\n   - Import statements are standard, and the code is generated with licensing and warning comments.\n\n2. **Potential Risks or Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious behavior, code obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code is boilerplate, generated, and purely structural.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0. All reports agree that there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0. No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.5 or below is appropriate, given that this is purely internal SDK boilerplate with no external data handling or security implications.\n\n4. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, standard, and internal.\n   - The purpose is clearly for type hinting and internal structure, not for data processing or external interactions.\n   - No reason to increase scores for malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious behavior, code is purely structural.           |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation. |\n| Security Risk  | 0.5 or lower    | No external data handling or security vulnerabilities.     |\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, given it's internal SDK boilerplate with no security implications)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
