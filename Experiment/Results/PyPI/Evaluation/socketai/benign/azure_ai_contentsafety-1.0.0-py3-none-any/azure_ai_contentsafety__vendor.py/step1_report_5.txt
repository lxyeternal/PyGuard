  "purpose": "Define internal abstract base classes for ContentSafety and Blocklist clients used within a larger SDK or system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for configuration modules and type hints for external classes; no input reading or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal classes marked for internal use only; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes with type annotations for internal SDK components. It includes a generated notice and licensing info, but no execution logic, data processing, or network activity. No potential attack vectors or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be boilerplate class definitions for internal use in a larger project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a benign setup component.",
