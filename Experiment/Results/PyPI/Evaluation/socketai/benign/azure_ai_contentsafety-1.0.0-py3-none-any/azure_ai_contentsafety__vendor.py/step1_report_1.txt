{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for internal use in Content Safety and Blocklist clients, mainly for type hinting and internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries and internal modules, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flow points that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; the code is straightforward, standard Python class definitions, with explicit comments warning about internal use.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines two abstract classes for internal use with type annotations, and contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage points, or malicious constructs are present. The comments explicitly state the classes are for internal use only and should not be used externally, indicating purpose is structural/type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as internal structure definitions for type checking and organization within a larger SDK or library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
