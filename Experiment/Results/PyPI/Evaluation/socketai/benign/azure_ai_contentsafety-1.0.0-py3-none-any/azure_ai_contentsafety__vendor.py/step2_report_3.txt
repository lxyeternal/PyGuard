  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines two abstract base classes (`ContentSafetyClientMixinABC` and `BlocklistClientMixinABC`) intended for internal use within an SDK.\n   - It imports configuration classes and uses `TYPE_CHECKING` for optional type hints.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or runtime logic.\n   - The code contains licensing and generated code comments, indicating it is boilerplate or generated code.\n   - The classes are purely for type annotations and internal structure, with explicit warnings that they are for internal use only.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No data input/output, network activity, or processing untrusted data is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or anomalies.\n   - The code is standard SDK boilerplate, serving as internal type hints.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Reports and Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, internal structure definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reasoning in the reports is consistent and thorough.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate, no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n5. **Potential Adjustments:**\n   - The scores given (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely structural and for internal use, the risk of malicious behavior is negligible.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, does not contain network calls, and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate for internal type hinting and structure. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The current scores are accurate and should not be changed.",
