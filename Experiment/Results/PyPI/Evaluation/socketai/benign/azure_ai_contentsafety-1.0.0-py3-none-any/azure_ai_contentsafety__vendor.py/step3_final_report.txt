{
  "purpose": "Defines internal abstract base classes for Content Safety and Blocklist clients, serving as type hints within an SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports configuration classes and type annotations; no runtime data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; code contains only class attribute annotations without executable flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward generated boilerplate with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two abstract base classes used solely for internal type hinting, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It contains standard licensing comments and generated code warnings. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is structural, and it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for internal SDK use. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive elements. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
