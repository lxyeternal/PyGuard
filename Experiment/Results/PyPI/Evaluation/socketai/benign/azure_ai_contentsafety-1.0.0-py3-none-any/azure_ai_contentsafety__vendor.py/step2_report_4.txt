  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines two abstract base classes intended for internal use in an SDK, specifically for Content Safety and Blocklist clients.\n- It imports configuration classes and uses type annotations, with comments emphasizing internal use only.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, network calls, or runtime logic.\n- The code is generated, with standard licensing and warning comments.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static class definitions with type hints, and no runtime or data flow concerns.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code is purely structural, serving as internal type hints for SDK components.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and generated, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is for internal use only, with no data processing or external inputs.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is straightforward and generated.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis code is benign, purely structural, and designed for internal type hinting. No suspicious activity or security concerns are evident.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** I confirm that the code is standard SDK boilerplate, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
