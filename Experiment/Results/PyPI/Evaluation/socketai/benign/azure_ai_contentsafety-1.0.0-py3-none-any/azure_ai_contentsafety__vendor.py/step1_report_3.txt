  "purpose": "Define internal abstract base classes for client mixins related to content safety and blocklist functionality.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks, data leaks, or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines classes and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains standard licensing and generated code comments, no suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract base classes for internal use, with no executable logic, input handling, or data processing. It references external configurations and serializers, but does not execute or process untrusted data. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious component defining internal typing classes for SDK use. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
