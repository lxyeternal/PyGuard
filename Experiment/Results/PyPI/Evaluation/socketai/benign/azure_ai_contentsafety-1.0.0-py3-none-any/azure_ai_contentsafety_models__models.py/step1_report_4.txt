{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models for an Azure content safety SDK, including request and response models for text and image analysis, as well as blocklist management.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from method parameters, JSON mappings, and object attributes, especially in model initialization and data fields such as 'text', 'image', 'blocklist_items'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be stored or transmitted when models are serialized or sent to a server; however, there are no explicit network operations or data exfiltration code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or JSON mappings into model instances, which are then used for API requests or responses. No direct source-to-sink malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets, are present. The code is mostly boilerplate model definitions generated by a code generator. No network connections or file operations are included.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions with type annotations and serialization hints for a content safety SDK. It contains no runtime logic, network calls, or code execution mechanisms. The models are for data validation and serialization only. The code is generated by an external tool, which is common for SDKs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data leaks, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, auto-generated SDK data model module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data exfiltration, network operations, or system modification. The overall security risk is very low.",
