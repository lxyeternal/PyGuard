  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely data models for content safety SDK operations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The risk score could be conservatively set at 0 or 0.1; given the nature of the code, 0 is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
