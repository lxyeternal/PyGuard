{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for content safety analysis, blocklist management, and analysis results, primarily serving as SDK data structures.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters or JSON mappings during object initialization; no external data sources or network calls are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data flows only within object instantiations and serialization; no external data transmission or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or JSON into model instances; no external or malicious data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; models are standard auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of auto-generated Python data models using standard typing and serialization mechanisms. There are no runtime behaviors, external interactions, or obfuscation. The models are designed for data exchange within an SDK context, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely data models for content safety SDK operations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The risk score could be conservatively set at 0 or 0.1; given the nature of the code, 0 is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
