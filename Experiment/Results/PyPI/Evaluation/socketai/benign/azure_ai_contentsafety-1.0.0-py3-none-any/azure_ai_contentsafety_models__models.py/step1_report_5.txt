{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an Azure Content Safety SDK, including request and response models for text and image analysis, as well as blocklist management.",
  "sources": "Code imports from internal modules, class initializers, and data model attributes, especially any dynamic or external input handling in model initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output in model serialization/deserialization, but no direct sinks for untrusted data or system commands are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into model objects via initializers and is likely serialized/deserialized for network communication; no direct malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard data modeling constructs with no code injection, obfuscation, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for data models with type annotations and initialization overloads. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates environment variables. The models include fields for text, images, blocklist items, and analysis results. The class constructors only delegate to superclass initializers with no suspicious code. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be auto-generated model classes for API requests/responses, which are standard in SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow. It appears to be a straightforward set of data models for an Azure Content Safety SDK, generated for serialization/deserialization of API data. No security risks or malware are identified.",
