{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for a content safety analysis API, including text and image analysis options and results, and management of blocklists.",
  "sources": "The code reads class initializations, attribute assignments, and model definitions. No external input sources or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted, such as network calls or file writes.",
  "flows": "The data flow is limited to model data storage and retrieval within class instances; no external data flow or command execution is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be generated boilerplate for data models, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated language features or unusual dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or misleading code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data model classes using standard patterns for serialization and deserialization, with type annotations and overloads for flexible initialization. It employs a consistent structure, with no external inputs, outputs, or execution logic. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are apparent. The models are for content analysis, not for executing any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for data modeling in a content safety API. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
