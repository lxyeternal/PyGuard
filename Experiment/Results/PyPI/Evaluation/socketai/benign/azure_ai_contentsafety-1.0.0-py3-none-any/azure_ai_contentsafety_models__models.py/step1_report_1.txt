{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and options for content safety analysis, including text and image analysis, blocklist management, and analysis results.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, rest_field definitions, and type annotations reading input data; no external untrusted sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network or system commands; the code solely defines data models and data handling structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data initialization and serialization within model constructors, with no external data transmission or processing beyond object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be auto-generated model definitions with standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data model classes for request and response payloads related to content safety analysis. It uses standard Python typing, inheritance, and data serialization via 'rest_field'. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The structure follows typical auto-generated SDK patterns with overloads for initialization and clear separation of data models from logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of auto-generated data models for handling content safety analysis requests and responses. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this code segment. It appears to be safe and intended for use as part of a larger SDK or API client.",
