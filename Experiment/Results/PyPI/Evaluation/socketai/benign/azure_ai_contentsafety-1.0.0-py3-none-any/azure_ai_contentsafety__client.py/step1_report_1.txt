{
  "purpose": "The code defines clients for interacting with Azure Content Safety and Blocklist services, encapsulating request handling, serialization, and policy management.",
  "sources": "Endpoint URL, credentials (AzureKeyCredential or TokenCredential), request object (HttpRequest), configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Request URL formatting, network request execution via PipelineClient, serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and configuration -> Request creation and URL formatting -> Sending request through PipelineClient policies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard SDK components and well-structured request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements client classes for Azure service interactions. It uses standard libraries and patterns for HTTP request management, including deepcopy for request safety and policy chains for request processing. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution mechanisms are present. The code does not include any network connections to suspicious domains or data exfiltration mechanisms. All data handling appears to be via official SDKs and Azure endpoints, with no signs of malicious data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SDK client implementation for Azure Content Safety and Blocklist services, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected request handling and policy chaining without suspicious or malicious features.",
