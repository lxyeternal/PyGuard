  "purpose": "Client SDK classes for Azure Content Safety and Blocklist services, handling request formation and network communication.",
  "sources": "Endpoint URL, credential objects, request parameters, configuration policies.",
  "sinks": "URL formatting, request copying, network request execution via PipelineClient.",
  "flows": "Input data (endpoint, credentials) used in URL formatting and request creation, then sent through PipelineClient.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard SDK patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Azure SDK clients, involving URL formatting, request copying, policy application, and request sending. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The request flow is standard, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The use of deep copies and URL formatting aligns with best practices. No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK client implementation for Azure Content Safety and Blocklist services. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal, estimated at 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of SDK wrapper code.",
