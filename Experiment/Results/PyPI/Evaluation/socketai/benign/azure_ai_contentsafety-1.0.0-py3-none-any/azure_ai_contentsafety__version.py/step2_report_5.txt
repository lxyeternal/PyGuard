  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that consists solely of comments, license information, and a version string assignment.\n- No input/output, data processing, external calls, or data flows are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate or metadata, with no suspicious or malicious activity noted.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the content.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are minimal and contain only metadata, with no logic that could be exploited.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the clear and unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n**Score review:**\n- The scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all appropriate and consistent with the content.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the provided reports, the code is entirely benign, serving only as metadata.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
