  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version string assignment.\n- No input/output, data flows, functions, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code structures are identified.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate or metadata, typical for SDKs or modules.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is benign, metadata-only, no malicious intent.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes boilerplate nature.\n- Scores: all zero — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard generated code with no risks.\n- Scores: all zero — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, metadata/license info with no executable code.\n- Scores: all zero — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Header comment and version assignment, no logic.\n- Scores: all zero — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scoring:\n\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the clear minimal nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- Since all reports agree on benign nature, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are unjustified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely metadata with no executable or data handling components.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign boilerplate, with no security concerns.",
