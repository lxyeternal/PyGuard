{
  "purpose": "This code serves as metadata, including licensing information and versioning, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and comments serve as static metadata; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only static comments and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with no executable or data handling components. It contains only comments, licensing info, and a version string assignment, with no functions, input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, metadata-only, and poses no security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the content, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
