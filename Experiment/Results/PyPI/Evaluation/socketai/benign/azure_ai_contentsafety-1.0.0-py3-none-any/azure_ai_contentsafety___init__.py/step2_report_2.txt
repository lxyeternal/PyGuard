  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a generated SDK module with imports and version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) is noted but common in generated SDKs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard SDK setup.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the wildcard import which could be misused but is typical here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on extensibility via dynamic patching.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import again noted, but standard in SDKs.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — same reasoning as above.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on SDK setup, with no untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import present but typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK initialization.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: import setup, versioning, optional patching.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import, but common.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard SDK initialization with dynamic patching.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import, but typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The wildcard import, while potentially suspicious in other contexts, is a common pattern in generated SDK code and does not inherently imply malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to the wildcard import which is standard in SDK patch mechanisms but could be misused if the `_patch` module were malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\nGiven the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to the wildcard import, which is typical but should be monitored.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The minor risk score reflects the wildcard import pattern, which is common but could be a vector if the imported module were malicious.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a deeper review of the `_patch` module or related components.",
