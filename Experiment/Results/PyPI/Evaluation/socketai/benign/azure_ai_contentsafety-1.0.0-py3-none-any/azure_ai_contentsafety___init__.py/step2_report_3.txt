  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a generated SDK module primarily responsible for importing internal components, setting version info, and applying optional patches.\n- No reports identify any actual data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) is noted but considered standard in generated SDK code, not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code structure and comments suggest a benign, boilerplate setup for an SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any issues with the code's logic or behavior. They are consistent with a typical SDK initialization module.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The main concern is the wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`). While common in generated code, it can obscure imported names and potentially hide malicious code if the `_patch` module is compromised. However, there's no evidence here that `_patch` contains malicious code.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a very low risk score (~0.1), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but it is standard in generated SDKs and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency and assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent based solely on the wildcard import.\n- They recognize the code as standard SDK boilerplate, with no evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and my review, I conclude:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mostly due to the wildcard import pattern, which is typical in generated SDKs but warrants monitoring)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code appears safe and standard for an SDK setup module.\n- No further action needed unless `_patch` modules are found to be malicious in the future.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, generated SDK initialization module with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
