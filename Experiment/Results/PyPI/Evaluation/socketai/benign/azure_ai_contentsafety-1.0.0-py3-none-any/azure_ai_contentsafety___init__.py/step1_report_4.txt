{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Python SDK for content safety and blocklist management, setting up imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_client, _version, _patch), and the version variable.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows or can cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Imports and patching functions are executed sequentially without untrusted data flow; no data is processed from external sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports optional patches and extends the __all__ list, which is typical for modular SDKs. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements, version assignment, and optional patch imports with exception handling. It sets up the SDK's public API and applies patches if available. The pattern is standard for generated SDK code, with no dynamic code execution based on untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be boilerplate initialization for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK setup code with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Its structure and content suggest a benign purpose.",
