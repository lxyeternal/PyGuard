{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an SDK module by importing client classes, setting version info, and applying optional patches for extensibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_client, _version, _patch) and the wildcard import from ._patch.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and optional patch application flow; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from ._patch import *') which can obscure imported symbols but is common in generated SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module with version management and optional patching. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The wildcard import is a typical pattern in such SDKs but could be a concern if the _patch module were malicious. No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code's structure and comments indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, generated SDK initialization module with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minimal security risk score reflects the common use of wildcard imports in SDKs but does not indicate malicious activity.",
