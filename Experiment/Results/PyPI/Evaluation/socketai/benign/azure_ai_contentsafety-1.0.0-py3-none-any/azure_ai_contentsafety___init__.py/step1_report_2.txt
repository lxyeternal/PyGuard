{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and configure clients and versioning for a content safety SDK, with dynamic patching capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules, version info, and optional patch imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; primarily module imports and function calls.",
  "flows": "Initialization of clients and patches, but no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`), which can obscure actual imported content, but this is a common pattern for optional patches. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and manages versioning, including conditional import of patch modules. It dynamically extends the __all__ list with additional patches if available, then calls a patch function. This pattern suggests extensibility and customization rather than malicious activity. No evident data leakage, malicious payload, or malicious logic is present. The wildcard import could be seen as a potential obfuscation technique but is typical for patching mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK setup module, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It manages dependencies and optional patches securely. There are no security risks or malicious intent apparent from this fragment.",
