{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a client library for interacting with a Content Safety service, providing classes and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _version, _patch) and the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or executes untrusted data or external commands; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines imports, version info, and extension mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from ._patch import *') which can obscure code behavior. No explicit credentials or suspicious patterns. The try-except for import errors is standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and version info, extends an all list with additional patches if available, and calls a patching function. The wildcard import could hide malicious code if present in the _patch module, but there's no evidence of malicious intent here. The code is typical for a generated SDK component, with no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be standard SDK initialization code generated for a client library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The use of wildcard import is a potential concern but is common in generated code; no malware indications found.",
