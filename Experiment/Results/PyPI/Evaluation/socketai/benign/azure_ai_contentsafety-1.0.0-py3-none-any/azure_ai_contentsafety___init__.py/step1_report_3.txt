{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a generated SDK or client library for interacting with a content safety service, providing client classes and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_client, _version, _patch), reading __version__ from _version, attempting to import optional patch modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly imports and initializes modules, without executing untrusted data or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional patching flow into setting __all__ and calling _patch_sdk() without involving untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual operations. It is a standard SDK setup code with generated comments and licensing info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK module with generated comments, licensing, and import statements. It uses try-except for optional imports and dynamically extends the __all__ list. No untrusted input handling or malicious code is detected. It follows standard patterns for module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated SDK setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
