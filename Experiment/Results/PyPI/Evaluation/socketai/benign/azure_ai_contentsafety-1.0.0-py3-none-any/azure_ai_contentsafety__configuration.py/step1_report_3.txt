{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes for ContentSafetyClient and BlocklistClient to manage credentials, endpoints, and policies for Azure cognitive services.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as 'endpoint' and 'credential'; internal method calls like '_configure' and '_infer_policy'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks in this code; no data is written to external locations or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from parameters to internal attributes; credential policy inference from credential objects; configuration setup for policies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code follows standard pattern for Azure SDK configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class-based configurations for clients interacting with Azure services, focusing on setting credentials, endpoints, policies, and default parameters. It includes standard credential type checks, policy creation, and configuration setup. No input sanitization or dangerous operations are present. The functions are straightforward and adhere to typical SDK design patterns. No anomalies or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for Azure SDK clients, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles credentials and policies securely and conventionally, without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
