{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes for Azure Content Safety and Blocklist clients, setting up connection parameters, policies, and credentials for interacting with Azure Cognitive Services.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'endpoint', 'credential', and optional keyword arguments in the constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are where data could be used in network requests via policies and headers, but no malicious code execution or data leaks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters ('endpoint', 'credential') to policy configuration and authentication setup, with no indication of untrusted data manipulation or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code primarily handles configuration setup and policy instantiation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically initializes configuration objects for Azure SDK clients, handling credential types, API versions, and policies. It uses standard Azure SDK practices, including credential type checks and policy setup. No suspicious logic or behaviors, such as data exfiltration or code injection, is detected. The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for Azure Cognitive Services clients, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical SDK patterns without any suspicious elements.",
