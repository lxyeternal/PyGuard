  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward template for SDK customization. The code contains only import statements, an empty list `__all__`, and a function `patch_sdk()` with a descriptive docstring. There are no data processing, external calls, network operations, or embedded code that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears to be intentionally minimal and boilerplate, with no logical errors or security flaws. The purpose is clearly to serve as a placeholder for user customizations.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any security-sensitive operations or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify this as boilerplate code with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**  \n   The scores align well with the code's content and purpose. The detailed analysis confirms that this code is a safe, non-malicious template.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks present)\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nGiven the context and the reports, there is no reason to increase the scores. The code is purely structural, intended for user customization, and contains no harmful elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring is appropriate and justified based on the code content and analysis.",
