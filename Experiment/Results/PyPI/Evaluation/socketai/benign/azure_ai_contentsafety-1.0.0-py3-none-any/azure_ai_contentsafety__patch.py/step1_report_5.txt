  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, including a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard template with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The function 'patch_sdk' is a placeholder for customizations, with no implementation details that could pose risks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing information, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty list '__all__', and a single function 'patch_sdk' with only a docstring and no executable code. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The structure is typical for a customization template in SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template intended for SDK customization. It does not contain any malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated content. It serves as a placeholder for future user modifications without any inherent security concerns.",
