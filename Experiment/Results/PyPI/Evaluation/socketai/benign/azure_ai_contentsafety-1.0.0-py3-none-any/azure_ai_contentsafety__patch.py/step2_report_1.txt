  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward template for SDK customization.\n   - It includes licensing comments, an import statement (`from typing import List`), an empty list `__all__`, and a single function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or executable logic.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is intended as a placeholder for future customizations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No embedded code suggests malicious intent.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic behavior or external dependencies.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that this is boilerplate SDK customization code.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The purpose is to serve as a placeholder for user modifications, not to perform any operations.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is only a template with no malicious behavior, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - The scores assigned (all zeros) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes to the scoring are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. It is a safe, standard placeholder template.",
