{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDKs, providing placeholders for user modifications.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data; it mainly defines functions and variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is primarily structural and placeholder in nature.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior. It includes standard licensing comments, an import statement, a placeholder list, and a function docstring with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization. It defines a licensing comment, a module-level variable '__all__', and a function 'patch_sdk' with a descriptive docstring. There are no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The absence of executable logic, input handling, or external dependencies suggests no malicious intent. Its purpose is to enable user customization, not to perform any specific operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural template intended for SDK customization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
