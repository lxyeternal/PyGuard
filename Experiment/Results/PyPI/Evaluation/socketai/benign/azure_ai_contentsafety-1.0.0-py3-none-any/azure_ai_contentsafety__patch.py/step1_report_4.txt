{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated code, specifically for an SDK, with no active logic or behavior implemented.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present; only import statements and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists due to absence of executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments, import statements, a variable declaration, and an empty function with a docstring. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template meant for SDK customization. It includes a license header, a docstring with a URL for guidance, an import statement, a declaration of __all__, and a function patch_sdk with a docstring. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic, nor any external calls, making it unlikely to be malicious. The structure and content are typical for SDK customization placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless template with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for future customization and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
