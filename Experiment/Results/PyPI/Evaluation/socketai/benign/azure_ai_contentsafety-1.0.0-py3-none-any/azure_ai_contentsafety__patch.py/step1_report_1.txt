{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically related to Azure SDK Python packages, allowing users to add custom behavior without modifying the auto-generated code directly.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present; the code contains only function definitions and comments.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or outputs; the code does not perform any data transmission or manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths as the code only defines a placeholder function without executing any logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. It appears to be a boilerplate or template with no embedded malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a typing List, defines an empty list '__all__' for public API control, and a function 'patch_sdk' intended for future customizations. There are no input operations, data processing, or external communications. The comments indicate it's part of a customization process for SDK code, which is typical in SDK development. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, boilerplate code template for SDK customization with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides a placeholder function for future custom modifications without executing any harmful or sensitive operations.",
