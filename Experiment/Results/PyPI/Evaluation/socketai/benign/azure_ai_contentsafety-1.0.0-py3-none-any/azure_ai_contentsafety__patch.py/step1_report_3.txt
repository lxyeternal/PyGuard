{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or placeholder for customizing generated SDK code, primarily used for extending or modifying auto-generated Python SDKs from Microsoft.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the imported module 'typing' and the hardcoded string docstring; there are no user inputs or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could influence the program are present, as the code does not process or output any data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input processing, or untrusted data propagation paths in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal implementation, only defining a function with a docstring and an empty list. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template intended for user customization. It imports standard modules, defines an empty public API list, and provides a function for patching SDK behavior. There are no data processing, no external inputs, no network operations, and no security-sensitive actions. It appears to be a benign scaffold for SDK customization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for user customization in SDK development and does not perform any harmful or security-compromising actions.",
