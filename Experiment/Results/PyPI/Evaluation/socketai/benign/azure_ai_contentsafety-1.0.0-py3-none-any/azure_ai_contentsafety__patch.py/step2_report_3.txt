  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward template for SDK customization.\n   - No input/output operations, external data processing, or network calls are present.\n   - The code contains only import statements, variable declarations, and an empty function with a descriptive docstring.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is minimal and intentionally so; it functions as a placeholder.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is meant as a hook for user customization, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, unobfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they focus on the code's structural purpose.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive content is present.\n   - The purpose is clearly to allow user modifications, not to execute any harmful actions.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (Confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a safe, standard SDK customization scaffold with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
