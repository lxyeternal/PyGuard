  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- No reports identify any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code consists solely of comments, import statements, an empty list `__all__`, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or data flows are present.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a scaffold for user customization, not to perform any logic or processing.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does *not* contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no issues or errors are apparent.\n- The code's purpose as a placeholder means it cannot have vulnerabilities or malicious behavior unless altered.\n\n**Score Recommendations:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Security risk score: 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n\n**Justification for Scores:**\n- Since the code is a benign template with no executable logic, no external dependencies, and no data processing, the risk is negligible.\n- The purpose is explicitly for customization, which inherently involves user modifications; the base code itself is safe.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a harmless, boilerplate SDK template with no malicious or security concerns.",
