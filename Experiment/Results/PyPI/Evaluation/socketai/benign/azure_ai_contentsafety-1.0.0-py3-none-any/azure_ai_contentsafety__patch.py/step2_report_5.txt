  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - It contains:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - An import of `List` from `typing`.\n     - An empty list `__all__`.\n     - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring and no implementation.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, structural template with no malicious intent.\n   - They consistently note the absence of data flow, external dependencies, or executable logic.\n   - The purpose described aligns with the code's content: a placeholder for user customization in SDK development.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are accurate and thorough; no logical flaws or errors are evident.\n   - The conclusion in each report that the code is safe and non-malicious is justified.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 in all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.0 or 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n6. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - Both are correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated content.\n   - The code is straightforward and transparent.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and content.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to it, given no security concerns)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThis code is a standard, harmless SDK template with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign SDK customization scaffold.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and the reports are accurate.",
