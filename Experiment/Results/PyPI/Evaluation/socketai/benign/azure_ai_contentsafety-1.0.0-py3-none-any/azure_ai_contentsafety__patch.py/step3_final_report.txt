  "purpose": "Template for SDK customization, allowing user modifications without executing any logic.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external calls, or data reading; only static code and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the function is a placeholder with no operational code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static template intended for user customization. It contains licensing comments, an import statement, an empty list, and a single placeholder function with only a docstring. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or executable logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a scaffold, not to perform any operations, making it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a placeholder for user modifications. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
