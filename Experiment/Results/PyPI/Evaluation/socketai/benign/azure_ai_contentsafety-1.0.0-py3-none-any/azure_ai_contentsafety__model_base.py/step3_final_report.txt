{
  "purpose": "The code provides serialization and deserialization utilities for models, handling datetime, bytes, decimal, and complex types, primarily used within SDKs for data transformation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from model attributes, JSON strings, and external inputs during deserialization processes.",
  "sinks": "Data is serialized into JSON, base64 strings, or datetime formats; no external network or data exfiltration is present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through deserialization functions into model objects, or from model attributes into JSON-compatible formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. Use of reflection and dynamic deserialization is standard for SDKs and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility for data serialization/deserialization, utilizing reflection, dynamic type resolution, and handling various data formats. It does not contain network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The complex features are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard serialization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified, and the overall security risk is low.",
