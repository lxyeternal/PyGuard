{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate random passwords with specific constraints such as length, character types, and exclusions.",
  "sources": "User-defined properties for password constraints, including min/max length, character type counts, and exclusion lists.",
  "sinks": "Generated passwords returned as strings; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input constraints influence the selection of characters for password generation, which are then combined and shuffled to produce the final password.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'choice' from 'secrets' or 'random' for randomness; fallback to 'random' in case 'secrets' is unavailable. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys detected. Code logic is straightforward for password generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for customizable password generation. It properly enforces constraints and uses secure randomness when available, falling back to less secure methods if necessary. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The methods strictly generate passwords based on user-defined or default parameters without external dependencies or side effects. The shuffle_password and non_duplicate_password methods manipulate the password characters securely within the scope of their purpose. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard password generator implementation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to expected functionality for generating passwords and does not exhibit signs of malware or sabotage.",
