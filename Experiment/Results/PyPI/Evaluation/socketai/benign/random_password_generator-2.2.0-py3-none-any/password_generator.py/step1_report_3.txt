  "purpose": "The code is intended to generate random passwords with specified constraints and shuffle them.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class properties and method parameters, especially in generate(), shuffle_password(), and non_duplicate_password().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data to affect external systems or leak information; the code only generates passwords locally.",
  "flows": "Input properties -> password generation and shuffling functions; no external data flows to network or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code uses standard libraries and methods for random password generation.",
  "analysis": "The script provides password generation functions using standard libraries like string, random, and secrets. It employs choice and shuffle to create passwords respecting various constraints. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. The methods are designed solely for password creation and shuffling, with no suspicious side effects or obfuscation. The try-except block for importing 'secrets.choice' ensures fallback to 'random.choice' but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate password generator without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward password generator with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses common Python libraries for randomness and password construction, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
