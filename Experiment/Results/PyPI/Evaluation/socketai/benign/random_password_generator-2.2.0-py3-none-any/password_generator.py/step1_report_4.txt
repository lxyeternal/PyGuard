{
  "purpose": "The code generates random passwords with configurable character requirements and provides functions to shuffle passwords and generate non-duplicate passwords.",
  "sources": "Input data includes class properties such as password length, character inclusion/exclusion lists, and input parameters to methods (password string, maximum length).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs generated passwords; it does not send data over the network, access system resources maliciously, or perform any suspicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class properties and method inputs (length, character sets) through internal processing to generate passwords; no untrusted external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The code uses standard libraries and methods for password generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a PasswordGenerator class to create random passwords with specified constraints. It uses the 'choice' function from 'secrets' or 'random' for randomness, with fallback for compatibility. The generate() method constructs passwords by selecting characters from allowed sets, respecting exclusion lists, and ensuring minimum counts. It shuffles characters to enhance randomness. The shuffle_password() method reorders characters in a given password, and non_duplicate_password() generates a password with unique characters by removing used characters from the pool. All operations are typical for password generation; no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. No external data inputs or network activity occurs, and no code acts to harm or exploit systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate password generator with configurable parameters. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design adheres to good practices for password creation, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
