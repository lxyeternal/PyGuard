  "purpose": "A password generator class that creates passwords based on customizable constraints such as length, character types, and exclusions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for password constraints, internal character sets, and exclusion lists.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Generation of password components from character pools, combining, shuffling, and returning the final password string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of both 'secrets.choice' with fallback to 'random.choice' introduces a minor security concern but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent password generator utilizing common libraries. It enforces constraints correctly, handles exclusions, and provides methods for shuffling and generating non-duplicate passwords. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The fallback from 'secrets' to 'random' slightly reduces cryptographic security but does not introduce malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password generator with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The minor security concern regarding fallback randomness does not elevate the overall risk significantly. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
