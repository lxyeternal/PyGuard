  "purpose": "Define the package path based on the current file location",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current script's directory",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used or outputted",
  "flows": "The value of __file__ is used to compute PACKAGE_PATH; no further data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the os module and assigns PACKAGE_PATH to the directory of the current script file. It does not perform any data input, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. There are no hardcoded secrets, external inputs, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for determining the script's directory; no malicious behavior detected.",
