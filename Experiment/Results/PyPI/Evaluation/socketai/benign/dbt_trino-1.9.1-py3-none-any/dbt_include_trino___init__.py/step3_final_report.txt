  "purpose": "Determine the directory path of the current script using __file__.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ variable to get the script's filename.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used directly in os.path.dirname to assign PACKAGE_PATH.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and assigns PACKAGE_PATH to the directory of the current script using os.path.dirname(__file__). This is a standard pattern for resource loading. There are no external inputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not involve any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are accurate and justified.",
