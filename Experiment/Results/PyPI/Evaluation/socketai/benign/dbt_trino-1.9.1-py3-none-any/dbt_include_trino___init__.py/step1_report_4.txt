  "purpose": "Define the package path based on the current file's directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of __file__ to determine the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data is handled.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used to set PACKAGE_PATH; no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple and straightforward without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then sets PACKAGE_PATH to the directory containing the current script using os.path.dirname(__file__).. This is a common pattern to determine the script's directory path for resource loading or configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code does not read any external untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility snippet to determine the current script's directory. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
