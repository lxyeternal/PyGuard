  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate database connection and credential management module for Trino, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security concern is unsafe SQL string interpolation and environment variable modification, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but these are common pitfalls rather than malicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to these insecure practices. No active malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present."
