  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and the creation of an AdapterPlugin object for the dbt Trino adapter. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. The structure is typical for plugin registration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and transparency support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin registration script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate, indicating a benign and secure component.",
