  "purpose": "Define a data class for handling Trino database column descriptions and data types with type parsing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements (re, dataclasses, typing, dbt.adapters.base.column, dbt_common.exceptions), class methods, and properties within TrinoColumn.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not handle untrusted input directly or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The from_description class method processes raw_data_type strings to instantiate a Column object with parsed data type info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. The regex used for type parsing is straightforward and well-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for representing Trino database columns, including logic for parsing data types from description strings. It safely handles type extraction using regex, with appropriate error handling for invalid formats. There is no indication of malicious code, data exfiltration, or insecure behavior. All imported modules are standard or explicitly relevant for data parsing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling database column descriptions and parsing data types. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a utility for type interpretation with proper error handling and safe parsing logic.",
