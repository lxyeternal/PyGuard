{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python data class 'TrinoColumn' for representing database columns in Trino, including methods for interpreting data types and sizes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'raw_data_type' parameter in the 'from_description' class method, and from class attributes such as 'dtype' and 'char_size'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs data validation and parsing; however, it does not write to external systems or execute untrusted commands. No direct data leakage or dangerous actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'raw_data_type' input through regex parsing to determine data type and size, then to object instantiation. No untrusted data is passed to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs detailed parsing of data type strings, including regex matching, but this is standard for such use cases. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No signs of malicious backdoors, external network activity, or code injection are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to parsing and representing database column types with methods that handle size and type determination. It includes input validation via regex and exception handling. All data manipulations are confined to type parsing and object creation without external side effects. No external data transmission, code execution, or malicious constructs are detected. The code appears clean, well-structured, and focused solely on data representation and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class implementation for handling database column types with robust parsing and validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs straightforward data processing without external communication or insecure operations.",
