  "purpose": "Parse and represent Trino database column data types from string descriptions, enabling structured handling of type information.",
  "sources": "Input string raw_data_type in from_description method, which reads data type descriptions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data beyond parsing.",
  "flows": "Input raw_data_type -> regex match -> extraction of type and size components -> creation of Column instance.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for parsing data type strings; potential for regex-based Denial of Service (DoS) if input is maliciously crafted, but no malicious intent or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class for parsing Trino data type strings into structured Column objects. It employs regex to extract type and size information, with exception handling for invalid formats. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The primary security consideration is the regex pattern, which could be exploited with crafted input to cause performance issues (regex DoS). The malware score is zero, as there is no malicious behavior or backdoor. The obfuscated score is zero, reflecting clear, maintainable code. The security risk score is slightly elevated (0.2) due to the potential regex DoS vector, but this is a known and manageable risk rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for parsing database column types, with no malicious intent or activity detected. The main concern is the potential for regex DoS if input is maliciously crafted, which justifies a minor increase in security risk score. Overall, the code is appropriate for its purpose, with minimal security concerns.",
