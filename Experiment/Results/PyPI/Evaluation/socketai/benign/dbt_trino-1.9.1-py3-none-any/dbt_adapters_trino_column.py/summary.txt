  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for parsing database column types, with no malicious intent or activity detected. The main concern is the potential for regex DoS if input is maliciously crafted, which justifies a minor increase in security risk score. Overall, the code is appropriate for its purpose, with minimal security concerns."
