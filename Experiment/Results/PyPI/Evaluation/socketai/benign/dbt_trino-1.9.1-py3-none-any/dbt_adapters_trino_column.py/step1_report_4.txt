  "purpose": "Define a Python class 'TrinoColumn' for handling Trino database column types with various helper methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, methods, and regex parsing within 'from_description'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'raw_data_type' processed via regex, resulting in object instantiation with parsed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The regex parsing is standard for type description parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with methods for handling string types and parsing data type descriptions. It includes standard data validation and exception handling for parsing numeric values. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The regex parsing is used for type description interpretation and appears straightforward. The code does not include obfuscated patterns or malicious logic. It appears to be a typical schema handling utility for a database interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a data class for handling database column descriptions with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs data parsing and validation in a typical manner.",
