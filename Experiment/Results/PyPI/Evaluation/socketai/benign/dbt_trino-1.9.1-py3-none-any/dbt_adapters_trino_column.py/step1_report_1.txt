  "purpose": "Defines a Python class TrinoColumn for handling specific data types in Trino database systems, with methods for interpreting and managing column data types.",
  "sources": "Imports re, dataclasses, and type hints. Reads data types from string inputs in from_description method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to misuse in string formatting or regex processing if malicious data is provided, but the code does not execute untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "from_description method processes raw_data_type input; regex matches extract type and size info; conversions and class instantiations occur based on this data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No network or system modification functions are present. Regex is standard for data type parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code parses data type descriptions, converting string inputs into class instances. It uses regex matching to extract type details and handles various formats. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of regex and string formatting is straightforward and safe. No network or file operations are performed. It appears to be a legitimate utility class for data type interpretation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured data type parser with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely interprets input data types for database column definitions without any indicators of malicious activity.",
