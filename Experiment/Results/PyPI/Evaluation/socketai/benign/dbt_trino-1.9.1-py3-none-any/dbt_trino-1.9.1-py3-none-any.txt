      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate database connection and credential management module for Trino, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security concern is unsafe SQL string interpolation and environment variable modification, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but these are common pitfalls rather than malicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to these insecure practices. No active malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only security note is the default SSL validation setting, which is explicitly documented and configurable, posing no active threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the default insecure SSL validation setting, which is a minor configuration concern rather than an active vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for parsing database column types, with no malicious intent or activity detected. The main concern is the potential for regex DoS if input is maliciously crafted, which justifies a minor increase in security risk score. Overall, the code is appropriate for its purpose, with minimal security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign ORM utility class for Trino with no malicious activity. The main concern is potential SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but this is a common pattern in ORM code assuming validation occurs outside. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
