  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simply assigning the string `\"1.9.1\"` to a variable named `version`.\n   - The original code confirms this: `version = \"1.9.1\"`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a static version assignment, typical in package setup files.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are present.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code, or external data interactions are involved.\n\n3. **Scores Assessment:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any operation beyond assigning a static string.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n   - The code does not introduce any security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The assigned scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n   - There is no need to adjust scores upward; the risk remains at zero.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only a version string, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n   - No malware or obfuscation scores should be higher than 0.\n   - The overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple version declaration with no security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the provided reports and the actual code content.",
