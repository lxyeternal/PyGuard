  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string '1.9.1' to the variable 'version'. It is a typical package version declaration with no suspicious elements, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The code is straightforward and does not perform any operations beyond variable assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only as a version identifier, and contains no malicious or security risks.",
