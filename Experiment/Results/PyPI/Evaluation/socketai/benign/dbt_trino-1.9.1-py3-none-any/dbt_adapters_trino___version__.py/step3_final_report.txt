  "purpose": "Assigns a static version string for package identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a constant string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string \"1.9.1\" to the variable 'version'. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, dynamic behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, anomalies, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code's simplicity confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version string assignment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
