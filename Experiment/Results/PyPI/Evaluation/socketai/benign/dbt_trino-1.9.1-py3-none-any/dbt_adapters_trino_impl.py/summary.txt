  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only security note is the default SSL validation setting, which is explicitly documented and configurable, posing no active threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the default insecure SSL validation setting, which is a minor configuration concern rather than an active vulnerability."
