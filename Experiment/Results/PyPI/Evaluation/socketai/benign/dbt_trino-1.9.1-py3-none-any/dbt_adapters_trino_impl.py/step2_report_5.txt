  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard dbt adapter for Trino, with no malicious code or backdoors. The only noteworthy aspect is the default SSL certificate validation being insecure, but this is explicitly documented and configurable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable given the minimal security concern primarily about default SSL behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or supply chain sabotage detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard implementation with no suspicious behavior. Exception handling in `get_columns_in_relation` is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical dbt adapter with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only security note is about SSL validation being configurable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard implementation with no suspicious patterns. No dynamic untrusted input handling or network calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is a typical dbt adapter setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to the default insecure SSL setting, but this is well-documented and configurable, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the documented insecure default SSL validation, a risk score of around 0.2 seems appropriate, but since it’s explicitly documented and configurable, it’s not a serious security concern.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a dbt adapter for Trino with no malicious intent or supply chain issues. The only potential concern is the default SSL validation setting, which is documented and can be configured securely.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
