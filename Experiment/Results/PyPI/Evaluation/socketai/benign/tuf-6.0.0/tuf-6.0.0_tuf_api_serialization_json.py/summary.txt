  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure implementation of serialization/deserialization routines for TUF metadata, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1). The existing assessments are accurate and justified."
