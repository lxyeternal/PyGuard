  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a generic Python script potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input sources such as environment variables, files, or user input; also imports external libraries and modules.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to files, network sockets, or displays; uses functions that could execute system commands or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as file writes or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected; no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code structure appears standard with typical imports, function definitions, and control flow. No suspicious patterns such as malicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The absence of hardcoded credentials and no signs of obfuscation suggest no malicious intent. The code does not perform unsafe operations like SQL injection or insecure system commands. Given the limited context, the overall behavior seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal, benign Python script with no malicious activity detected.",
