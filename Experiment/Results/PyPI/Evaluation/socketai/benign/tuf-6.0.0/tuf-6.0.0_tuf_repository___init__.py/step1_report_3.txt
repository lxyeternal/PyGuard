  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a single import statement importing classes from a private module. There is no data processing, external communication, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, minimal module setup for a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets up imports for repository-related classes. No security risks identified.",
