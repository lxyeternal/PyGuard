  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and exceptions for serializing and deserializing TUF metadata objects, enabling custom implementations for security-sensitive cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Imports (abc, typing, tuf.api.exceptions), class definitions, method definitions",
  "sinks": "Methods that convert metadata objects to bytes and vice versa; potential misuse if overridden maliciously, but inherently safe in this context",
  "flows": "deserialize() reads raw bytes input, serialize() outputs bytes data; no external untrusted data flow outside method parameters",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, defining interfaces and exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes for serialization/deserialization without implementing actual logic, thus no malicious operations occur here. It properly segregates interface and error handling, with no embedded or hidden code. No unsafe patterns, no data leaks, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The code itself appears purely structural and standard for a serialization framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition for TUF metadata serialization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, serving as a foundation for secure implementation. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
