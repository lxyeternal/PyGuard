  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of abstract base classes, exception definitions, and import statements.\n- No actual data processing, network communication, or untrusted data handling occurs within this snippet.\n- The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining interfaces and error classes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a foundation for serialization/deserialization implementations elsewhere.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- They note the absence of data flows, external interactions, or embedded secrets.\n- The code's design aligns with common, well-understood patterns for defining serialization interfaces.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- The security risk scores are 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- Since this is an interface layer, the actual security implications depend on how subclasses implement these methods. However, within this code snippet, no issues are present.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code only defines abstract classes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a standard, foundational component for a larger system, designed for extension and implementation elsewhere. It does not pose any security threat in its current form.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that subclasses implementing these interfaces are scrutinized for security issues, but the interface definitions themselves are safe.",
