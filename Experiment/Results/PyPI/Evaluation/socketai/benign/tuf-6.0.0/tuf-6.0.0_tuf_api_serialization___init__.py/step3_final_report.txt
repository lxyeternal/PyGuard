{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and error classes for serialization and deserialization of TUF metadata, serving as an interface layer for extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method signatures; no data input or external data sources within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only declares interfaces without processing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; abstract methods are placeholders for implementation.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward interface definitions with no suspicious patterns or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract classes and custom exceptions for serialization purposes, following standard Python practices. It does not process data, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input directly. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The design is typical for defining interfaces, and the code's security implications are minimal. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard interface layer for serialization of TUF metadata, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
