  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for repository and download errors within the TUF framework, facilitating error handling and categorization.",
  "sources": "Import of StorageError from securesystemslib.exceptions (unused in this snippet). No input sources; code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are static definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of StorageError; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward exception classes with descriptive docstrings, including a constructor for HTTP error details. No network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The import of StorageError is unused but harmless. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is standard for error handling in a security framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for the TUF framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
