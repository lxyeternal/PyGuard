  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a TUF (The Update Framework) implementation, including repository and download errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for StorageError from securesystemslib.exceptions, and class definitions for various exception types.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines exception classes without any data processing or input/output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within these exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard exception class definitions with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for a security framework. It imports a standard exception class, 'StorageError,' but does not use it within this snippet, which is typical for modular exception handling. All classes inherit from base exception classes and include descriptive docstrings. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks are present. The structure and content align with standard practices for error handling in Python security-related code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a TUF implementation. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall security risk score is very low.",
