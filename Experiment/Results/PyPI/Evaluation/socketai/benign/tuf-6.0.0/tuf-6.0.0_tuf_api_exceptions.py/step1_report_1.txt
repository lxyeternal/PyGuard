  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to repository and download errors in the TUF (The Update Framework) implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for StorageError from securesystemslib.exceptions; class definitions and their methods.",
  "sinks": "None present in the code; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely class definitions and import statements without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code constructs. No network or data handling, no code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for exception handling with descriptive docstrings. It imports a specific exception class but does not use or extend it directly within the shown code. The classes serve as custom error types, which is common practice for structured error handling. There are no operations, data processing, or logic that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for the TUF framework, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any untrusted operations or data handling that could lead to security issues.",
