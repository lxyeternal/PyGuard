{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a TUF (The Update Framework) implementation, mainly for repository and download-related errors.",
  "sources": "None (code only defines classes and imports; no input or data reading present).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data is processed or used in a vulnerable manner).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The only notable point is the inheritance from standard exceptions and a simple constructor that assigns a status code in one class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of exception classes for repository and download errors, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. It includes an import from a security library (securesystemslib) but does not utilize it directly in this snippet. The only potentially noteworthy element is the custom constructor in 'DownloadHTTPError' that stores an HTTP status code, which is standard practice for such error classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code appears to be standard exception handling setup for a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a TUF-based system. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
