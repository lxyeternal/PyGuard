  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration including version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, static comments, and docstring.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with comments, a docstring, and a version string assignment. It contains no functions, data processing, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code serves as package metadata, a common and benign pattern. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and static nature of the code. Confidence in benignity is high (1). No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
