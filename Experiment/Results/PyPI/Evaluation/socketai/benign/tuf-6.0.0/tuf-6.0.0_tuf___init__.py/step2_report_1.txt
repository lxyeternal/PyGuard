  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code to determine if the conclusions are justified and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module with:\n     - A copyright comment.\n     - An SPDX license identifier.\n     - A docstring.\n     - A single variable assignment: `__version__ = \"6.0.0\"`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be setting package metadata.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, such as code injection, network calls, file operations, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for package metadata.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - They note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and well-founded.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - **Confidence:** Ranges from 1 to 1.0, reflecting high certainty in benignity.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Overlooked Issues:**\n   - The only possible concern could be if this code were part of a larger malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence.\n   - The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n6. **Overall Judgment:**\n   - The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified.\n   - The scores reflect the code's benign nature appropriately.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Maliciousness Justification:** No malicious activity detected; code is purely metadata.\n- **Obfuscation Justification:** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Justification:** No security risks present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign package metadata snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
