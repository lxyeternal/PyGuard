{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically versioning information, and includes a copyright notice.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static variables and comments only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; minimal code with standard comments and version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment, SPDX license identifier, a docstring, and a version string variable. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs. The code appears to be a typical module header for a package called 'TUF' with version 6.0.0. There is no malicious logic, data leakage, or suspicious behavior present. The code is straightforward and standard for open-source package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package's source files.",
