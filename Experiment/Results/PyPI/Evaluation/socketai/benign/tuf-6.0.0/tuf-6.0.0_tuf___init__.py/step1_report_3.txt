  "purpose": "Define package metadata, specifically the version string for the TUF project.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals (__version__, comments, and SPDX license identifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Only comments, license identifiers, and a version variable are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments, a license identifier, and a version string assignment. No external input handling, no sensitive data processing, and no malicious or suspicious behavior are present. The structure is simple and typical for a package metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata snippet with no malicious intent. It simply declares version and licensing information for the TUF project. No security issues or malware detected.",
