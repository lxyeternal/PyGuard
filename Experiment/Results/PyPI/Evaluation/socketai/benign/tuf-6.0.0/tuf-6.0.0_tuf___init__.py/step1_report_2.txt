  "purpose": "Declare module metadata for the TUF project, specifically setting the version string.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__ = \"6.0.0\"' as a hardcoded value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a license comment and a version declaration; no suspicious or unusual code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license comment, a SPDX license identifier, and a single line setting the __version__ attribute. There are no functions, data input/output, or dynamic behaviors. The version string is hardcoded and does not interact with any external or sensitive data. The code appears to be a simple module metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version declaration and license comment. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
