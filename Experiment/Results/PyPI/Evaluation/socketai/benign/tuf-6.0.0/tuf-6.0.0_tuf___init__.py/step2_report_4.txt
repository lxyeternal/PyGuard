  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static metadata: a copyright comment, SPDX license identifier, a docstring, and a single version string assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or data manipulation.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Security Risks**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious logic, no data leakage, and no suspicious activity.\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, this assessment is accurate.\n   - No evidence suggests obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard for package metadata.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations are evident.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n5. **Overall Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - The risk score is correctly low (0), reflecting no security concern.\n   - Malware score is correctly zero, as there's no malicious code.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code snippet and the reports, I concur with the evaluations.\n   - The code is a typical, benign module header for a Python package.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a standard, safe package metadata snippet with no security concerns.",
