  "purpose": "Standard setup script for configuring and packaging the Python project 'django-model-utils'. It reads local documentation files for long description and sets package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads local files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description; static configuration data for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and passes static metadata to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads local documentation files and configures package metadata. It does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. The structure and content are standard for Python packaging, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All operations are static and safe, following best practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are correctly assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, consistent with the analysis.",
