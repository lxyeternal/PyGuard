{
  "purpose": "The script is used for setting up a Python package called 'django-model-utils', configuring its metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description, and environment variables for file paths.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected that could process untrusted data; the code primarily performs file reads and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> preparing long description -> passing configuration to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to follow standard setup procedures without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and setuptools modules, defines a function to read documentation files for long description, resolves file paths safely, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. All file operations are straightforward and only involve known package files. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. The setup configuration is typical for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It performs expected operations for package distribution without any security risks.",
