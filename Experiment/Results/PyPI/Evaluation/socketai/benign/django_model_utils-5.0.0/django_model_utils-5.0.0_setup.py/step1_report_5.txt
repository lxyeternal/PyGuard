  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-model-utils' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README and CHANGES files for long description, package discovery via find_packages, reading environment variables (implicitly through os.path functions).",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long description; package setup configuration flows. No untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious obfuscated code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading documentation files, configuring package metadata, and specifying dependencies. Uses standard libraries and well-known setup tools. No indications of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. No network activity, user input processing, or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical and benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
