{
  "purpose": "A Django utility class for managing choices, supporting various formats, nested groups, attribute access, and iteration.",
  "sources": "Input choices provided during instantiation, internal data structures storing processed choices.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is stored and accessed internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Choices are processed from input into internal triples, then accessed via iteration, attribute, or indexing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated utility for handling Django choices, including nested groups. It processes input choices into internal mappings for display and attribute access. There are no network calls, file I/O, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The data flow is entirely internal, and the code does not execute untrusted code or transmit data externally. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for Django choices management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
