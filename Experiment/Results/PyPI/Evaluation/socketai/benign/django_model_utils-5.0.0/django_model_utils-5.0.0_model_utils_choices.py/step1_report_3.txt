  "purpose": "The code defines a generic Choices class for managing choice options in Django models, supporting different tuple formats, option groups, and attribute access to choices.",
  "sources": "Input choices provided during Choices class instantiation; data stored internally in _triples, _doubles, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found; no data flows leading to network, file, or sensitive data leaks. No unsafe execution or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Choices data structures are processed internally and stored; no external untrusted data flows to critical sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to handle choices for Django models, including support for nested groups and attribute access. It extensively uses type annotations and careful data processing. No signs of malicious logic, external calls, or unsafe operations are present. The code's purpose is straightforward, with no indication of harmful intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on data structure management for choices in Django models. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. It is a well-structured, safe utility class for choice management.",
