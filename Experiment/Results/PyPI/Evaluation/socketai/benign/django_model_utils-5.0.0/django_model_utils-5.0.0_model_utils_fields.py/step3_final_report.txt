{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django model fields for timestamps, status, text splitting, UUIDs, and tokens, primarily for model data management and utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Model instance attributes, default functions, signal handlers, environment variables (settings). No external untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "Model fields and signals that set or update data within the Django ORM; no external network or system calls are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from default functions or signals into model attributes; cryptographic functions generate tokens/UUIDs; no external data or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of secure libraries (`secrets`, `uuid`) is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard, secure practices for generating UUIDs and tokens, uses Django signals for timestamp management, and handles data consistently. No external inputs or network activity are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The use of cryptographically secure libraries is correct, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. It relies on standard, secure libraries and Django patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
