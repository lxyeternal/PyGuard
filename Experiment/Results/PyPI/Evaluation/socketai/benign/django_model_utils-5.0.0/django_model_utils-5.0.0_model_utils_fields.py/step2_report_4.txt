  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the claims made.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose and data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code uses secure libraries (`secrets`, `uuid`) and standard Django practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0.0 aligns with the assessment; security risk 0.1 is reasonable given the use of cryptographic functions but no external interactions.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scoring are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes the use of class attributes, signals, and factory functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identifies the flow of data, including token and UUID generation.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is secure, standard, and without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the data flow and sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly notes the use of secure libraries and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, aligns with the code.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly summarizes the code's intent and data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is secure, with no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no changes required.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0, which is consistent with the code's use of standard cryptographic libraries and absence of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low, reflecting standard practices without evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to cryptographic functions, but no external or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk exists in this code.",
