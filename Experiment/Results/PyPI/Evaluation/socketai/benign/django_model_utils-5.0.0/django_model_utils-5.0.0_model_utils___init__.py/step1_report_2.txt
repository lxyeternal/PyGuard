{
  "purpose": "This module initializes and exposes specific classes and version information for the django-model-utils package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version('django-model-utils') and imports local modules Choices, FieldTracker, and ModelTracker.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute any untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves attempting to read the package version; if unavailable, it sets __version__ to None.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules and local modules, retrieves the package version safely within a try-except block, and sets the __all__ attribute for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The use of importlib.metadata is standard for version retrieval, and the exception handling is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization module without any malicious intent or security risks. It securely attempts to get version info and exposes selected classes. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
