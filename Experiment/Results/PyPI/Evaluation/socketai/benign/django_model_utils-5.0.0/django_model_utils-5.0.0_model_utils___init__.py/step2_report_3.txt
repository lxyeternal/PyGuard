  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, straightforward, and performs typical package setup tasks.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.version()` with exception handling is standard practice.\n- The code is for retrieving package version info and defining module exports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's correctness:\n- The code matches the description: imports `importlib.metadata`, attempts to get the version of `'django-model-utils'`, and handles the case where the package isn't installed.\n- No discrepancies or errors are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The exception handling for missing package is appropriate.\n- The code's purpose is clear and implemented correctly.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: very low (0.1 or 0)\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score of 0.1 (or 0) is appropriate because:\n  - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n  - It only retrieves package metadata.\n  - No external inputs or outputs are involved.\n- The malware score is 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, but these are unfounded given the code.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for minimal package handling)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard package initialization snippet, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 for absolute safety)\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and typical for package version handling.",
