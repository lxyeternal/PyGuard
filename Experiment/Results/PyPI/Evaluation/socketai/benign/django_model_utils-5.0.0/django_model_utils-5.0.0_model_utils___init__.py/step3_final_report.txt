  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'django-model-utils' package if installed, and define module exports.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call, which reads package metadata; local module imports (.choices, .tracker).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flows from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() reads package info; sink: assigns to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of importlib.metadata, attempts to retrieve the version of 'django-model-utils' with proper error handling, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The exception handling is appropriate, and the logic is simple and safe. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package initialization snippet for version retrieval and module exports. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
