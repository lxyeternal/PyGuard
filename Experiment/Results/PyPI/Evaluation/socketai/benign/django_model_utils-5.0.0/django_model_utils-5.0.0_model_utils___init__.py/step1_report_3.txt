{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import modules and retrieve the version of the 'django-model-utils' package for use in a larger Django project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata.version() for 'django-model-utils'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used or propagated; the code only handles package metadata and exports.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing package metadata to setting the __version__ variable, with no external data influence or further data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard library functions and imports without any unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and attempts to retrieve the version of an installed package. If the package is not installed, it sets __version__ to None. It also exports certain symbols. There is no input/output from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The structure and functionality are typical for a module's version handling and import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior. It simply manages package metadata for use elsewhere. No security risks or malware are detected.",
