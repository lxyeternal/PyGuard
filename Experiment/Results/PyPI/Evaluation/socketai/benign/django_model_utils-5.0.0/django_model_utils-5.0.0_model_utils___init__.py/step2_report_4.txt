  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a standard module setup: importing local modules, retrieving package version info via `importlib.metadata.version`, handling exceptions if the package isn't installed, and defining exports with `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input/output from untrusted sources, or any suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**  \nNo report indicates any logical errors or flaws. The code uses best practices for version retrieval and error handling. The pattern is consistent across all reports, indicating standard, correct implementation.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No obfuscation is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The code only performs benign imports and version handling.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal or no security concerns. Given the code's simplicity and safety, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNone of the reports suggest any behavior that would justify a higher risk score. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Consideration**  \nSince no malicious activity is detected—no payloads, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity—the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard. No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis: all are low or zero, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the benign nature)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical package initialization script for a Python module, performing safe imports and version retrieval with proper error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe and well-structured.",
