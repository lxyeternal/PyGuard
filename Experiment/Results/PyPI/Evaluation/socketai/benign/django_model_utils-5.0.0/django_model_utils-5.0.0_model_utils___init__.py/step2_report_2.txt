  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `importlib.metadata` for version info.\n- Imports local modules `.choices` and `.tracker`.\n- Attempts to retrieve the installed package version of `'django-model-utils'`, setting `__version__` accordingly.\n- Defines `__all__` for public API exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code performs standard imports and version handling with proper error handling (`PackageNotFoundError`). No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The logic is straightforward, standard, and safe.\n\n- **Scores given:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and very low `securityRisk` (mostly 0 or 0.1). These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, standard practice, correct error handling.\n- **Score:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1` (slightly above zero but justified as minimal risk).\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, consistent, straightforward, safe.\n- **Score:** Same as above, reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Same, standard version retrieval, no issues.\n- **Score:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Same, standard package initialization.\n- **Score:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Same, straightforward code.\n- **Score:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports suggest malicious activity. The code does not perform any network I/O, dynamic code execution, or data handling from untrusted sources.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; only a minor `0.1` score, which is reasonable given the minimal functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, justified by the nature of version handling and import operations)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and safe.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent with the actual code. They correctly identify the code as a typical package setup module with no security issues. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and free of malicious intent.",
