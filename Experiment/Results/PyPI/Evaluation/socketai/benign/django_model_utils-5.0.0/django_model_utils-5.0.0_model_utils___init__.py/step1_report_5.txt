  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing modules and setting version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version call to get package version; import statements for local modules Choices, FieldTracker, ModelTracker",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard package initialization and version handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of importlib.metadata to retrieve the package version dynamically, handling the case where the package might not be installed. It imports local modules and sets the __all__ variable for exports. No untrusted input handling, no data leakage, no unsafe operations, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
