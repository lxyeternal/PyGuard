{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and version handling for the 'django-model-utils' package, defining public API components.",
  "sources": "Importing 'importlib.metadata' for package version info; importing local modules '.choices' and '.tracker'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or output sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The code reads package metadata via 'importlib.metadata.version' and sets version info, with no data flowing into or out of untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present. The use of try-except for package version handling is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, attempts to retrieve package version info with error handling for missing package, and defines module exports. No external data input or output handling that could be exploited. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical package setup tasks with proper error handling and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
