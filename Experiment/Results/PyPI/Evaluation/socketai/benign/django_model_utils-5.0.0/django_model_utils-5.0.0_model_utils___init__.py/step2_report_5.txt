  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard module setup: importing `importlib.metadata`, attempting to retrieve the version of `'django-model-utils'`, handling the case where the package isn't installed, and exposing certain classes and variables via `__all__`.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The reported security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's behavior:\n\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- It performs **standard package initialization tasks**: importing modules, retrieving version info with error handling, and defining exports.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.version()` is common practice for version retrieval.\n- The try-except block is appropriate and standard for handling missing packages.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is safe and typical for such a module.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The **security risk score** is very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal risk—appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions that this code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\n*Note:* The slightly above zero security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, considering the minimal handling of package metadata, which is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code is benign and standard.**\n- **No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent.**\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action needed. The code is safe as presented.",
