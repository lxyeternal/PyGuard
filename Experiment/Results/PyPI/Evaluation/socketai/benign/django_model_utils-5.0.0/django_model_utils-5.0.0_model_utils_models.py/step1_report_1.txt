{
  "purpose": "The code provides abstract base classes and utility functions for Django models, including timestamping, status management, soft deletion, time framing, and UUID primary key assignment, aimed at facilitating common model behaviors.",
  "sources": "Data is read from model fields (e.g., status, start/end dates, is_removed), class attributes (e.g., STATUS), and imported modules. No external untrusted sources or user inputs are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include the save methods updating timestamp or status fields, but these are standard and do not pose security risks. No direct data output or network operations are present. No unsafe code execution or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Model save methods update timestamp/status fields; signal handlers modify model classes to add query managers based on class attributes; no external data flows or untrusted input to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code uses standard Django practices and third-party libraries legitimately. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various abstract models for timestamping, status, soft deletion, time framing, and UUID primary keys, all typical in Django applications. Signal handlers dynamically add query managers based on class attributes, which is a standard pattern. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are observed. The delete method includes a soft delete implementation that sets an 'is_removed' flag, which is common practice. The code appears to be well-structured, leveraging established Django idioms and third-party libraries, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured Django models utility module without any malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates model behaviors such as timestamping, status management, soft deletion, and time framing, using safe and conventional techniques. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
