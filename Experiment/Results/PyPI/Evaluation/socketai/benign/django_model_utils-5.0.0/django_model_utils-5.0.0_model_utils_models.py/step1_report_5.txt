{
  "purpose": "This code defines multiple abstract base models and utility functions for use in Django projects, providing timestamping, status management, soft deletion, UUID primary keys, and query managers for specific fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes, model fields, and signal handlers during class preparation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the save() and delete() methods that perform database writes, particularly the soft delete setting 'is_removed' and the overridden save methods that update timestamp and status fields.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and fields into save() or delete() methods, potentially affecting database state. Signal handlers add query managers based on class attributes, which influence data retrieval but do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard Django practices, with no evidence of code obfuscation or malicious logic. No network operations, system commands, or privacy-violating behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common pattern-based abstract models with standard Django and third-party utilities. Save and delete methods are properly overridden for timestamp and soft deletion logic, respectively. Signal handlers dynamically add query managers based on class attributes, which is typical in Django apps. No untrusted input handling, insecure operations, or malicious code constructs are observed. The code aligns with best practices and does not show signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be well-structured, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. It leverages standard Django patterns and third-party libraries to enhance model capabilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
