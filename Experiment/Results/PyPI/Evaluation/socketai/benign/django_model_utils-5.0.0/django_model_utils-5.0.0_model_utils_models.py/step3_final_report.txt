{
  "purpose": "Provides abstract base models for timestamping, status management, soft deletion, time framing, and UUID primary key assignment in Django ORM models.",
  "sources": "Model class attributes, signal handlers for class preparation, and model save/delete methods.",
  "sinks": "Model save and delete operations, signal-driven manager additions, and class modifications.",
  "flows": "Signals trigger addition of managers based on class attributes; save methods update timestamp/status fields; delete method performs soft or hard deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic manager addition via signals is standard but could be misused if model attributes are manipulated maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django patterns for abstract models, signal handling, and soft deletion. No external data sources or sinks indicate malicious activity. Signal-based dynamic manager addition is common but requires proper configuration to prevent misuse. Save and delete methods are overridden appropriately. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The code is well-structured, clear, and adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Django utility module for model behaviors with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic manager addition via signals is typical but should be managed carefully to avoid misconfiguration. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
