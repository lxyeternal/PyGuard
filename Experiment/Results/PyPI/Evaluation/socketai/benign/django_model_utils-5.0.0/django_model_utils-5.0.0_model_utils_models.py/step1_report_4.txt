{
  "purpose": "Defines various abstract base classes and utility functions for Django models, including timestamp, status, timeframe, soft deletion, and UUID handling, with dynamic query manager addition.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django framework, model_utils package, and type annotations. No external data sources or user input are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or external system interactions are present. No sensitive data handling or leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code primarily sets up model fields and dynamic managers without data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code structure is typical for Django model utilities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed. The dynamic addition of managers could potentially be misused if misconfigured, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several abstract models providing timestamp, status, timeframe, soft deletion, and UUID functionalities. It includes functions to dynamically add query managers based on model status and timeframe, connected via Django signals. No data input/output operations, network communications, or cryptographic manipulations are present. The delete method in SoftDeletableModel appropriately distinguishes between soft and hard delete modes, with no suspicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be standard Django utility code with no malicious intent or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard set of Django model utilities and management functions with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It correctly implements soft deletion, timestamping, status management, and dynamic query managers without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
