  "purpose": "A Django utility script that configures settings, changes directory to 'model_utils', and executes a management command ('messages') based on user input ('make' or 'compile').",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument (sys.argv[1]) for command selection.",
  "sinks": "Calls Django's call_command with a string constructed from validated user input, executing 'messages' or related commands.",
  "flows": "User input ('make' or 'compile') flows into command string '%smessages' % command, then into call_command.",
  "anomalies": "The command string is constructed via string formatting with validated input; changing directory to 'model_utils' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code configures Django with a predefined setting, restricts command-line input to 'make' or 'compile', and executes a Django management command 'messages'. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Input validation limits command execution, reducing risk. The command string is constructed safely given the validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The only minor concern is the directory change, which is not inherently risky. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a controlled Django utility with limited command execution, no malicious intent, and no security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
