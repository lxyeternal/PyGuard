  "purpose": "Configuration file for building Sphinx documentation for the django-model-utils project.",
  "sources": "import os, importlib.metadata, configuration variables, commented-out sys.path modification.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling, network operations, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration primarily sets static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only standard configuration code; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. Commented-out sys.path modification is benign and typical in docs setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic or untrusted input processing. No external data, network, or credential handling is present. The commented sys.path modification is common in documentation configs. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for documentation purposes with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious code. It serves solely to configure the documentation build process.",
