  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'django-model-utils' project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, importlib.metadata; sets configuration variables for Sphinx, including extensions, paths, themes, and output options.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no code executes input data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script solely sets configuration parameters without executing external code or processing user input.",
  "anomalies": "The file appears to be a standard, autogenerated Sphinx configuration file with no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. No unusual or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and sets static configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation generation. It does not execute external commands, process input data, or contain dynamic code. The absence of extensions, dynamic imports, or code execution indicates low risk. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The overall structure and content are consistent with standard documentation build files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, autogenerated configuration file for building project documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
