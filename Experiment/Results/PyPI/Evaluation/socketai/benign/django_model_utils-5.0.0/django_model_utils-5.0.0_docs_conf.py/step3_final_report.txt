  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building Sphinx documentation for the django-model-utils project.",
  "sources": "Static configuration variables, import of standard modules (os, importlib.metadata), version retrieval, commented-out sys.path modification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. It imports only standard modules and sets static parameters. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The version retrieval via importlib.metadata is a common pattern. Commented-out sys.path modification is benign. All signals indicate a safe, static configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for documentation generation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
