{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Django model change tracking system using descriptors, signal hooks, and method patching to monitor and manage field modifications, deferred fields, and serialization behavior.",
  "sources": "Attribute accessors (__get__, __set__), signal handlers (class_prepared), method wrappers (save_base, refresh_from_db), and class attributes (descriptor, field names).",
  "sinks": "Internal attribute updates, deferred field management, and state preservation; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source inputs via attribute access and signal triggers flow through descriptor methods and patch wrappers, updating internal saved data and deferred states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The __getstate__ override in LightStateFieldFile is a known optimization pattern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django extension techniques for change detection, including descriptors, signal-based class finalization, and method patching. The LightStateFieldFile's __getstate__ method prevents pickling large objects, which is a benign optimization. No external system interactions, credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The complexity is typical for internal utilities, and no obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Django change-tracking utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (0.2) and zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified and appropriate.",
