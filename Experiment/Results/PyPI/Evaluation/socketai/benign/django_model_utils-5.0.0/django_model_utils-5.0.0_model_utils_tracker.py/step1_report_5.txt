  "purpose": "The code provides a set of classes and functions to track changes in Django model fields, including custom descriptor wrappers, deep copy handling, and context management for deferred fields. It aims to facilitate efficient change detection and state management in Django ORM models.",
  "sources": "Data is read primarily from model instances via attribute access, get_deferred_fields(), and refresh_from_db(). No untrusted external input sources are explicitly used within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be in saved_data, which stores copies of field values, but no direct data leakage or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No external sinks such as network connections or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model instances through get_field_value() and previous() into saved_data, then comparisons are made in has_changed() and changed(). The flow involves reading model attribute data, copying it into saved_data, and comparing current vs. saved values.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs advanced Python features such as custom descriptors, context managers, and method patching. The LightStateFieldFile class explicitly nullifies the 'instance' during pickling, which is a known pattern for preventing deep copy issues. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to enhance change tracking in Django models by wrapping descriptors and managing deferred fields efficiently. It uses context managers to track nested field resets, patches model methods to automatically initialize trackers, and provides mechanisms to compare field states. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The deep copy handling for FieldFile subclasses appears to prevent potential memory issues. Overall, the code focuses on change detection without performing any external or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django model change tracking utility with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It utilizes advanced Python features responsibly for internal state management. No security risks such as hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious actions are identified.",
