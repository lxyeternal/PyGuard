      "conclusion": "The code is a security-focused static analysis plugin with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It correctly flags insecure coding patterns and unsafe imports. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its purpose as a security enforcement tool. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's intent."
