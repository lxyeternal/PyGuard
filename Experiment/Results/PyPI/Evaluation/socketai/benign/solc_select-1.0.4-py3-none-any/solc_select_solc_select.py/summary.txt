  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing Solidity compiler binaries. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified by reliance on external sources, which is standard for such tools. Overall, it appears safe and aligned with best practices."
