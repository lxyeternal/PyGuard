{
  "purpose": "Check if the Mac system is an Intel or M1/M2 with Rosetta support.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform information via 'platform.machine()' and system platform via 'sys.platform'. Executes subprocess to check for process 'oahd' on macOS.",
  "sinks": "Potential subprocess execution that could be exploited if input is manipulated, though here it uses a fixed command.",
  "flows": "Reads system info, then conditionally runs a command based on system architecture, with no untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward system checks. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies that it runs only on macOS, then distinguishes between ARM and Intel architectures. It uses subprocess to check for a process 'oahd' (related to Rosetta) when on ARM Macs. The subprocess command is static and does not process external input. The logic is simple, transparent, and intended for system environment detection. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment check for macOS system architecture and Rosetta support. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks are present.",
