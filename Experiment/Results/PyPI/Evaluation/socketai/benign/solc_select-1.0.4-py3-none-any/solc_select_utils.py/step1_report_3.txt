{
  "purpose": "The function checks whether a Mac system is running on Intel architecture or an Apple Silicon with Rosetta enabled.",
  "sources": "The code reads system platform information via sys.platform, hardware architecture via platform.machine(), and executes a subprocess command to check for the 'oahd' process.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command could potentially be a sink if the input command were manipulated, but as it uses fixed arguments, it is safe. No untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "sys.platform and platform.machine() provide system info (sources) and are used internally to determine system type. No external input flows into the subprocess call.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward check with static commands and conditions. It assumes execution on macOS and will assert if run elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules to determine the platform and architecture. It asserts that the platform is 'darwin' (macOS). For ARM64 Macs, it runs a subprocess to check for the 'oahd' process, indicating Rosetta translation availability. For Intel Macs, it returns True directly. The subprocess call uses fixed command arguments and captures output without handling external untrusted input. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a benign system check with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system check for macOS architecture and Rosetta availability. It uses static commands and system info without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
