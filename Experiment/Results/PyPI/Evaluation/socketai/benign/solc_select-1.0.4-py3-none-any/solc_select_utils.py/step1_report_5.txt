{
  "purpose": "The code checks whether a macOS system is an Intel or M1/M2 Mac with Rosetta support.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform information (`sys.platform`, `platform.machine()`) and executes a subprocess command (`subprocess.run`) to check for a process (`oahd`).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution potentially exposes system command execution; no untrusted data input is handled or transmitted.",
  "flows": "System platform info -> conditional logic -> subprocess command to detect Rosetta process -> return boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The subprocess command checks for a process, but this is a legitimate system check for Rosetta support.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing necessary modules, then defines a function to determine if a Mac can run Intel binaries by checking system architecture and presence of a process. The subprocess call is used to detect Rosetta if on an ARM Mac. No malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent. The command used (`pgrep oahd`) is standard for detecting Rosetta's helper process and does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is straightforward, and the code performs a legitimate system check.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign system compatibility check for macOS. It uses standard modules and commands to determine system architecture and Rosetta availability. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
