The assigned scores are justified; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain 0. The security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.0, reflecting minimal risk. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain purposes."

The minimal security risk is inherent to executing external binaries based on validated user input, which is standard for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified."

The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified by reliance on external sources, which is standard for such tools. Overall, it appears safe and aligned with best practices."
