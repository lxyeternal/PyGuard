  "purpose": "Define directory paths and configuration constants for managing Solidity compiler versions and artifacts.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'VIRTUAL_ENV', hardcoded string constants, URLs for remote resources.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system behavior or data flow.",
  "flows": "VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable to HOME_DIR, then to paths for .solc-select and artifacts; URLs are static strings used for fetching remote resources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward environment setup and URL definitions without any suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets directory paths based on environment variables, with fallback to user home directory, and defines constants for CLI flags and architecture identifiers. URLs point to publicly accessible GitHub raw content for Solidity compiler artifacts and JSON listings. There is no code execution, data transmission, or data processing that suggests malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for managing Solidity compiler versions, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply defines constants and paths for later use.",
