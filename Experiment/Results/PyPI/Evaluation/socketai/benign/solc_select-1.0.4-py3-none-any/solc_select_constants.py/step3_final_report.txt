  "purpose": "Configuration setup for managing Solidity compiler versions and paths based on environment variables and static URLs.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'VIRTUAL_ENV', static URL strings for external resources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code only defines constants and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static URLs and environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes directory paths based on the 'VIRTUAL_ENV' environment variable or defaults to the home directory. It defines string constants for CLI flags and architecture identifiers. URLs point to static, well-known GitHub repositories for Solidity artifacts. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The code is purely configuration, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. All signals indicate benign intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for managing Solidity compiler resources. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The static URLs are from reputable sources, and environment variable usage is safe. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified.",
