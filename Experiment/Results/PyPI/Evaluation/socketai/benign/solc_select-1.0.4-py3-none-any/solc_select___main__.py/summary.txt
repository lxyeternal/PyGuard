  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI utility for managing Solidity compiler versions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security risk is inherent to executing external binaries based on validated user input, which is standard for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified."
