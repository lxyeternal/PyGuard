  "purpose": "CLI utility for managing Solidity compiler (solc) versions, including installation, switching, and upgrading versions.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse, user input for version selection, external binary paths derived from version info.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external solc binaries via subprocess.run, based on user-supplied arguments and validated version info.",
  "flows": "User inputs (version commands) -> argparse parsing -> validation functions -> path construction -> subprocess execution of solc binary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. External functions are assumed safe; subprocess call depends on validated user input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for managing local solc versions, delegating core functions to imported modules. It executes external binaries based on user commands, with validation functions presumably mitigating command injection risks. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess call is typical for such tools, and the code structure is straightforward. External modules' trustworthiness is assumed, and no evidence suggests malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to subprocess execution with user input, but validation reduces this risk. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and the low security risk (~0.2) is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI utility for managing Solidity compiler versions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security risk is inherent to executing external binaries based on validated user input, which is standard for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
