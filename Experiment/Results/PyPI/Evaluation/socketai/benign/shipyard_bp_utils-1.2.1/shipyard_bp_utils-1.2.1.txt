      "conclusion": "The code is a standard artifact management utility with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the use of pickle.load without validation, which can be exploited if untrusted pickle files are processed. The existing malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be increased to 0.6 to account for this risk. Proper validation, sandboxing, or replacing pickle with safer serialization formats is recommended to mitigate potential vulnerabilities."
