  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Only import statements, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains only internal module imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, only local imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No data processing, network, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, only import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Import statements alone are benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, minimal import statements.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements from local package modules; no data flow or anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and appropriate for such minimal code snippets.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay at 0, given the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay at 0, since no security issues are evident.\n\n**If I were to assign an overall estimate based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code snippets.",
