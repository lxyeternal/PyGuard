  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report to verify the findings, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Only import statements for internal modules; no data flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, only local module imports; no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is simple and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, only import statements with no data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is minimal and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Relative imports of modules within the package; no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar import statements; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is standard package code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are reasonable.\n- **Note on confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9) but still high; the code is very simple.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no data flow, no external sources, no anomalies.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, consistent with the code's content.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code snippet is extremely minimal; it doesn't perform any data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is entirely benign, and the reports are accurate in their assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
