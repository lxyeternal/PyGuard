  "purpose": "To import local modules 'args', 'files', and 'text' within the package, facilitating modular code organization.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements: 'from . import args', 'from . import files', 'from . import text'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or sinks present; the code only performs internal module imports.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules; no data flows from external sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three relative import statements for internal modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the code's purpose is purely to organize module imports within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
