{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules named args, files, and text from the current package, likely for use within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statements, which load modules from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data is being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows in this code snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious import patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic relative imports of modules args, files, and text from the current package. This is common in Python packages and does not involve any data processing, input/output, or malicious behavior. The snippet is too small to determine any malicious intent or suspicious activity, and it appears to be part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains simple import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard package code and does not raise security concerns.",
