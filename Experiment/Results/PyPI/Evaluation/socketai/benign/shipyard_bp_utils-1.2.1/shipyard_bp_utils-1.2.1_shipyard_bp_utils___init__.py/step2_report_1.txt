  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of import statements for local modules (`args`, `files`, `text`) using relative imports.\n- No data flows, external sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code snippets are minimal and standard for modular Python packages.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code in all reports matches the original code provided.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to import modules, which is benign.\n\n### Error or flaw identification:\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reports' logic or reasoning.\n- The assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0 in all reports; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; import statements alone are not malicious.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly set to 0; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code only performs local module imports without any external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution, scores above 0.5 for malware or security risk are unwarranted.\n- The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scores and reasoning. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately. No further action needed.",
