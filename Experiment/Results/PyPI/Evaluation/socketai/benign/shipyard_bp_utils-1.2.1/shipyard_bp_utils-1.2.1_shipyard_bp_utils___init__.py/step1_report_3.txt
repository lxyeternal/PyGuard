  "purpose": "Import modules 'args', 'files', and 'text' from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the same package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data flow identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only module imports without data processing",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing three modules from the current package. There is no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. Import statements by themselves are benign and do not indicate malicious behavior. The code is very minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden payloads, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
