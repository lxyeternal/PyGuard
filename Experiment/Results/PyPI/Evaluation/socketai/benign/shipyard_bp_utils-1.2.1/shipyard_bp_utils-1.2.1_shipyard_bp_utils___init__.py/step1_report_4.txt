{
  "purpose": "Importing modules or submodules within the package for further use",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules (.args, .files, .text)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks observed in the code snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; simple relative imports",
  "analysis": "The code contains only three import statements using relative imports to include modules args, files, and text from the same package. There is no execution of dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials, and no external network communication. The imports are standard Python syntax for modular code organization. As it is a minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
