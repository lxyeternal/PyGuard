  "purpose": "The code manages artifact files, providing functionality to read/write JSON and pickle data, and organize storage folders based on environment variables and vendor information.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('USER'), os.getenv('SHIPYARD_ARTIFACTS_DIRECTORY'), inputs via filename, file_type, data, and vendor during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (open, os.path.join, os.makedirs), pickle.dump, pickle.load, files.write_json_to_file, files.read_json_file.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence base folder path; data passed to read/write methods flows to file system read/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization can be risky if data is untrusted; no evident hardcoded secrets or credentials; environment variable usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file management tasks with environment variable-based path determination. Use of pickle is typical but can pose security risks if untrusted data is involved, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. The code appears structured, with no obfuscated logic or hidden behaviors. It mainly manages file I/O with logging. The environment variables are used for configuration, which is common practice. Overall, no signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical artifact management utility with standard file handling. Although pickle is used, no malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The code seems safe within its scope, with a moderate security risk due to pickle's inherent risks if misused, but this is not malicious per se.",
