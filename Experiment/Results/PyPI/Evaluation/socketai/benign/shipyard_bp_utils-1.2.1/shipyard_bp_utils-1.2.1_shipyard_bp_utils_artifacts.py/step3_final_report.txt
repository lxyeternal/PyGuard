  "purpose": "Manage artifact files (JSON and pickle) within structured directories, creating folders as needed, and using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ, os.getenv), reading files via open and files.read_json_file, writing files via files.write_json_to_file, pickle.dump, pickle.load.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted pickle files loaded via pickle.load, potential directory traversal via environment variables if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine base directory -> SubFolder methods read/write JSON or pickle files -> pickle.load executes potentially untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load without validation, reliance on environment variables for directory paths without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward artifact management utility handling JSON and pickle files, creating directories based on environment variables and vendor info. The main security concern is the use of pickle.load without validation, which can execute arbitrary code if untrusted pickle files are loaded. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The environment variables used for directory paths could be manipulated if not secured, but this is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the known risks of pickle deserialization. However, considering the potential for exploitation if untrusted pickle files are introduced, the security risk score should be increased slightly to 0.6 to reflect this inherent hazard, especially in environments where data integrity cannot be guaranteed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard artifact management utility with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the use of pickle.load without validation, which can be exploited if untrusted pickle files are processed. The existing malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be increased to 0.6 to account for this risk. Proper validation, sandboxing, or replacing pickle with safer serialization formats is recommended to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.",
