{
  "purpose": "To provide a utility function for hashing text using specified algorithms.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'text_var' parameter and the 'hash_algorithm' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The hashing operation itself is a sink, but it is standard and safe; no untrusted data is directly exposed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data 'text_var' flows into the hashlib hashing functions through encoding; supported algorithms are selected based on 'hash_algorithm' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The function supports common hashing algorithms without any obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility for hashing text with common algorithms (sha256, sha512, md5). It logs the process and raises an error if an unsupported algorithm is specified. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of hashing is standard, and the code relies on well-known libraries without any obfuscated or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for hashing text. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It correctly validates input algorithms and uses standard libraries securely.",
