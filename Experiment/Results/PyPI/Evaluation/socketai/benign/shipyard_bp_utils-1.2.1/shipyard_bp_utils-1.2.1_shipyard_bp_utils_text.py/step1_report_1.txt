{
  "purpose": "Hashing a given text input using specified hashing algorithms for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text_var' for the hash_text function, and the hash_algorithm parameter which can be influenced by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The hashing function outputs the hashed value; no direct sinks for untrusted data leaks are present, but the hashing result is returned.",
  "flows": "Input 'text_var' flows into the hashlib hashing functions after encoding; 'hash_algorithm' influences which hash function is used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of only common hash algorithms; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple hashing utility with support for sha256, sha512, and md5. It logs actions, validates the hash algorithm, and hashes the input string. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond the input parameter and output. The use of standard libraries and logging indicates typical behavior. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard hashing operations without any suspicious or malicious features. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is a benign utility function with no evident security concerns.",
