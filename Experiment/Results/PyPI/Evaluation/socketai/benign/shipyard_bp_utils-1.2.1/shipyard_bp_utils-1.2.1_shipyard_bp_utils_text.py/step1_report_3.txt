  "purpose": "Hashing input text using specified hash algorithms for security or integrity purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text_var' to the hash_text function.",
  "sinks": "hashlib hash functions that produce hashed output; logging statements.",
  "flows": "Input 'text_var' flows into the selected hashing function, producing hashed output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to hash a string using common algorithms. It uses a dictionary for supported algorithms and logs the process. Input data is taken as a string parameter, processed with standard hashlib functions, and output as a hexadecimal digest. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Logging is used for debugging but does not pose security risks. The import of 'shipyard_templates' appears to be for logging purposes and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of hashing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within typical patterns for hashing functions and logging.",
