  "purpose": "A utility function to hash input text using specified algorithms (sha256, sha512, md5).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text_var' and 'hash_algorithm' argument.",
  "sinks": "Return of hashed digest; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into hashlib functions via selected algorithm; output is the hex digest.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of hashlib; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward hashing utility that validates the algorithm, logs operations, and returns the hash digest. It supports common algorithms, including md5, which is deprecated for security-sensitive purposes but is used here as a feature. No external data sources or sinks beyond input and output are involved. The logging and import of 'shipyard_templates' for logging appear benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The support for md5 introduces a minor security concern but does not constitute malicious activity. The code's simplicity and correctness are confirmed by multiple reviews, with no logical flaws or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard hashing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The support for md5 is a known weak point but not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
