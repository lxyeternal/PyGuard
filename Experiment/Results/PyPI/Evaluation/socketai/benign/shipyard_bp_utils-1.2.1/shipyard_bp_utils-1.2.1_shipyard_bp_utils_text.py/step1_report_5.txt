  "purpose": "To hash a provided text input using a specified hashing algorithm.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text_var' which is a string provided to the hash_text function.",
  "sinks": "The hashlib hashing functions which produce a hash digest from the input text.",
  "flows": "Input string 'text_var' flows into the selected hashlib hash function, resulting in a hashed output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports hashlib and a custom logger, then defines a function to hash text with support for multiple algorithms. It verifies the algorithm against a predefined set, logs actions, and returns the hash. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code segments. The usage of hashlib is standard, and the function is focused solely on hashing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of hashing text securely with supported algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
