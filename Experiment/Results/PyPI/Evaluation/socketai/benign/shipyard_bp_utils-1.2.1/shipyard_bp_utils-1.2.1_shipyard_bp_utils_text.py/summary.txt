  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard hashing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The support for md5 is a known weak point but not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary."
