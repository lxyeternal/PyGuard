  "purpose": "Hash a given text string using a specified hash algorithm.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text_var' to the hash_text function.",
  "sinks": "The hashing functions hashlib.sha256, hashlib.sha512, hashlib.md5; the output of the hexdigest method.",
  "flows": "Input 'text_var' flows into the selected hash function, producing a hashed string as output.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of hashlib is standard for hashing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to hash a string using common algorithms (sha256, sha512, md5). It logs hashing operations and raises an error if an unsupported algorithm is specified. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of hashlib for hashing is standard and safe. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward hashing of input text with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal utility function with safe practices.",
