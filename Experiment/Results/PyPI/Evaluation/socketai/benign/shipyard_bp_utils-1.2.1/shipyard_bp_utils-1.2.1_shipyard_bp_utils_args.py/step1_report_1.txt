  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings to booleans and generating a Shipyard URL based on environment variables.",
  "sources": [
    "os.getenv() calls retrieving environment variables",
    "function parameters such as 'string' in convert_to_boolean"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "string concatenation and URL construction with parse.quote()",
    "logging statements"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input string 'string' flows into convert_to_boolean, influencing boolean result",
    "Environment variables are read in create_shipyard_link and used to construct URLs"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of environment variables directly in URL construction without validation or sanitization",
    "Potential exposure of environment variable values if logs are accessible, but only in debug or warning logs",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present",
    "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward and safe. convert_to_boolean processes input strings with proper logging and default handling. create_shipyard_link constructs URLs using environment variables; while this could be risky if variables are manipulated maliciously, there is no evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection or data exfiltration. The URL is formed with parse.quote() to sanitize parts, mitigating URL injection. Logging is used for debugging but does not leak sensitive info. Overall, no malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign utility functions with proper URL handling and logging. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. Environment variables are used in URL generation but are not directly malicious, and no secrets are exposed. The code appears safe and standard.",
