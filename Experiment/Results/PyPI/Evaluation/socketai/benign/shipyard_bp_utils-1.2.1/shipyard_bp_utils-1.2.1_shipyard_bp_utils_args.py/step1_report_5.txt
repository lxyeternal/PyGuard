  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings to booleans and constructing a URL link to a Shipyard log page based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SHIPYARD_ORG_NAME, SHIPYARD_PROJECT_ID, SHIPYARD_FLEET_ID, SHIPYARD_VESSEL_ID, SHIPYARD_FLEET_LOG_ID, SHIPYARD_LOG_ID",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed by create_shipyard_link(), used for navigation or logging purposes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; these variables influence URL creation, which is the sink. The URL is generated based on the presence of certain variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The URL construction appears conditional on environment variables; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code uses standard logging and environment access functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a custom logger, performs a string-to-boolean conversion, and constructs URLs based on environment variables. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. URL encoding is correctly applied. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The environment variables are used solely for URL construction, which is common in such utilities. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for internal URL generation and data conversion. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of environment variables for URL formation is standard practice, and there are no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
