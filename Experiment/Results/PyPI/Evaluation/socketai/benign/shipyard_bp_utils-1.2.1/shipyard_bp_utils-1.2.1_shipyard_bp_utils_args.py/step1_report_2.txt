  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting strings to booleans and generating a Shipyard log link based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls for environment variables, input parameters (string), imported modules (os, re, parse, ShipyardLogger)",
  "sinks": "String concatenation for URL creation, environment variables used in URL construction",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and then used to construct a URL; input string is processed for boolean conversion",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code safely reads environment variables to construct URLs, with proper checks for variable existence. The boolean conversion function handles string input securely with appropriate defaults. URL encoding is used via parse.quote. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or hidden backdoors. Use of environment variables is standard for configuration, and URL construction appears straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for URL generation and boolean conversion, with no malicious intent. It handles environment variables securely and does not perform any harmful actions. Overall, there are no security risks or malware indications.",
