  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting strings to booleans and constructing a Shipyard URL based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SHIPYARD_ORG_NAME, SHIPYARD_PROJECT_ID, SHIPYARD_FLEET_ID, SHIPYARD_VESSEL_ID, SHIPYARD_FLEET_LOG_ID, SHIPYARD_LOG_ID)",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL string; no data leaks or untrusted data effects beyond URL generation",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then used to build a URL with URL encoding; no further data flow or external calls",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; environment variables used directly without validation but this is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward utility functions: converting strings to booleans with logging and defaults, and generating a URL based on environment variables with conditional logic. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical, though validation could enhance robustness. URL encoding mitigates injection risks. Logging is appropriate and limited. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for URL creation and string conversion, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected. The environment variable usage is standard, and URL encoding ensures safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2).",
