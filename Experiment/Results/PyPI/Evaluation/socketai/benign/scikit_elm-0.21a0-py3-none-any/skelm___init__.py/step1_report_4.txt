{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a machine learning library related to Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). It imports various classes and functions from other modules and specifies the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes such as __version__ and imports several classes and functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that process untrusted data; it only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely initializes module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. All imported modules and variables appear standard for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "This code functions as an initializer or entry point for a package, importing components and exposing them for external use. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The structure is straightforward, typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, and does not raise any suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that exports modules and components. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign and conventional part of a Python library.",
