{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and utility functions, and defines the public API for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.elm, .large_elm, .hidden_layer, .solver_batch, .utils, ._version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data processing; only static imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module imports and __all__ definition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward, mainly imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions related to machine learning models and utilities from internal modules, then defines the module's public interface. There are no apparent data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. The module appears to be a standard package __init__.py file that organizes exports for users.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely consolidates imports and exports. No anomalies, no malicious code, and the risk of supply chain attack appears negligible.",
