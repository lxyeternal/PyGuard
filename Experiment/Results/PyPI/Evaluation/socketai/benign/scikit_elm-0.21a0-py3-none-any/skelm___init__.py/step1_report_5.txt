{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and utility components, then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as .elm, .large_elm, .hidden_layer, .solver_batch, .utils, and version info from ._version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no use of untrusted data sources or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — This module only imports and exports classes/functions; no data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with no unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from local modules related to machine learning models and utilities, then declares __all__ for public API exposure. It includes no logic, data processing, or network activity. The imports and export list are standard and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initializer for a machine learning package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes relevant classes and functions.",
