{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and exposes selected classes and functions via __all__ for public API access.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports from internal files and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing internal modules and defining __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code aligns with standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initializer with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
