  "purpose": "Implement a regularized linear regression model using Cholesky decomposition for efficient updates and predictions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'X' and 'y' in methods like 'partial_fit', 'fit', and 'predict'. Also, class properties and internal data structures (_XtX, _XtY, coef_, intercept_).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code mainly performs mathematical operations and updates class attributes. No data leaks or external calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'partial_fit' and 'fit' into internal matrices (_XtX, _XtY), then through '_solve' into model parameters (coef_, intercept_), which are used in 'predict'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code follows standard practices for a regression model. The only unusual aspect is the 'print' statement in 'partial_fit' for 'forget' updates, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a regularized linear regression with incremental update capability, using Cholesky decomposition for solving. No external network calls, no file operations, no code injections, and no obfuscated parts are present. It uses numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn libraries in conventional ways. The 'print' statement for 'forget' is harmless, likely for debugging. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a legitimate, albeit custom, regression solver.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an incremental regularized linear regression model with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard data handling, mathematical computations, and model updates. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
