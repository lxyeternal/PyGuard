{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a batch Cholesky solver for regularized linear regression, similar to Ridge regression, with partial fit capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data X and y in the fit and partial_fit methods; internal attributes such as _XtX and _XtY initialized and updated during fitting.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code primarily performs mathematical computations and data validation, with no data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data X and y are used to update covariance matrices (_XtX, _XtY) during partial fits; the _solve method computes model coefficients and intercept based on these matrices.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. The print statement in 'forget' branch is benign debugging output. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard linear regression fitting using Cholesky decomposition, with capabilities to incrementally update the model via partial_fit. It validates inputs, manages internal matrices, and computes coefficients. There are no network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of warnings, property setters, and method structures appear consistent with standard scientific computing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a regularized linear regression model with incremental fitting. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It does not contain backdoors or malicious data handling. Overall, it seems safe, with a low malware score.",
