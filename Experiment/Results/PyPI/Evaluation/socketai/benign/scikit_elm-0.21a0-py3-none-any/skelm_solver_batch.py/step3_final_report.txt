  "purpose": "Implement a regularized linear regression model with incremental fitting capabilities using Cholesky decomposition.",
  "sources": "Input data X and y during fit and partial_fit methods; internal attributes _XtX and _XtY for covariance matrices.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network calls; data flows within model attributes for computation.",
  "flows": "Data from X and y flows into covariance matrices (_XtX, _XtY), then through _solve() to produce coefficients and intercept.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a benign debug print statement '!!! forgetting' during data removal in partial_fit; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an incremental regularized linear regression model. It uses common scientific libraries and performs input validation, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The only minor anomaly is a debug print statement in the 'forget' branch, which is not malicious but should be replaced with proper logging or removed for production. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, and the implementation aligns with typical practices for such models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of an incremental regularized linear regression model. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor debug print statement does not impact security and can be considered benign.",
