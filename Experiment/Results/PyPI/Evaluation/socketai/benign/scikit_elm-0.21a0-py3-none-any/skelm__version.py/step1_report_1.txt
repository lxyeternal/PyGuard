  "purpose": "The code appears to define the version of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to the variable __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs beyond the variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version string assignment, no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.21a' to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages to indicate package version. There are no input sources, data handling, or execution flows. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The version string itself is a typical development release label, with no embedded secrets or obfuscated content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to specify the package version. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
