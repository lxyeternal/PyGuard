  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of the string `'0.21a'` to the variable `__version__`. There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is minimal, standard for version declaration, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent, such as embedded payloads, obfuscated code, or external communication.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable facts: the code is a simple assignment statement with no suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration pattern in Python packages. It poses no security threat and requires no further action.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0. No changes needed.",
