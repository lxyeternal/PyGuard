  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; a simple assignment statement with no dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for specifying package version in Python. It contains no input sources, data flows, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and harmless nature. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a version indicator. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
