  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe ML feature transformation component with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature and slight potential misuse of user-supplied functions. Overall, supply chain security risk is negligible."
