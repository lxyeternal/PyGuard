  "purpose": "The code defines a class for projecting data into a new space using pairwise distances to randomly generated centroids, mainly for feature transformation or dimensionality reduction.",
  "sources": "Input data X in fit() and transform() methods, random seed in __init__.",
  "sinks": "pairwise_distances function calls, which could potentially send data for processing; no other sinks with untrusted data manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> check_array -> fit() generates centroids -> transform() computes distances between data and centroids.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of check_array and pairwise_distances is standard. No code injection or data leakage evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard feature projection technique based on random centroids and pairwise distance metrics. The 'fit' method generates random centroids based on a specified random seed, and 'transform' computes pairwise distances between input data and these centroids. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or obfuscation is present. The usage of established libraries (scipy, sklearn) and functions aligns with typical practices. No suspicious network activity or malicious data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate feature transformation via random centroids and pairwise distances. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation for a machine learning transformation task.",
