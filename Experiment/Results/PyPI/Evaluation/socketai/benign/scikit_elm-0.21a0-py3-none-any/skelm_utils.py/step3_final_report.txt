  "purpose": "A scikit-learn transformer that generates random centroids and computes pairwise distances between input data and these centroids for feature transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data X in fit() and transform() methods, data validation via check_array.",
  "sinks": "pairwise_distances function computes distances; no data leaks or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> check_array -> fit() generates centroids -> transform() computes pairwise distances between data and centroids.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard ML transformer for generating random centroids and computing pairwise distances. It uses well-known libraries like scikit-learn and scipy, with proper data validation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The data flow is straightforward, and the functions perform expected operations. The only minor security consideration is the use of pairwise_distances on potentially untrusted data, but this is a common operation in ML pipelines and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a feature transformation component. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1), reflecting the standard data processing nature without malicious intent.",
