  "purpose": "Define a scikit-learn transformer for pairwise distance projection using random centroids.",
  "sources": "Input data X in fit() and transform() methods.",
  "sinks": "pairwise_distances function call potentially processes untrusted data for distance calculation.",
  "flows": "Input data -> check_array() -> pairwise_distances -> output distance matrix.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries, defines utility functions, and implements a scikit-learn transformer class. The class generates random centroids and computes pairwise distances. The code uses well-known library functions without obfuscation, and the data flows are typical for such a transformation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All operations are standard for feature transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a feature transformation using random centroids and pairwise distances. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
