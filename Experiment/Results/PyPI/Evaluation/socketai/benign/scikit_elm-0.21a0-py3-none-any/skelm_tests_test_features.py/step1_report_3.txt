{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for ELMClassifier and ELMRegressor models from the skelm library, testing neuron configuration and forgetting behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, sklearn.datasets, and skelm modules; no user input or external data reading within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only performs model fitting and scoring with predefined datasets.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from sklearn datasets flows into model training and scoring functions, with no external or untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears to be standard unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and machine learning models, then runs parameterized tests to verify model behavior with different neuron counts and forgetting capabilities. It fits models on dataset splits and compares scores, with no indication of malicious activity. There are no suspicious code flows, no data leaks, or external data transmissions. The functions are standard testing procedures, and no obfuscated code, malicious code, or anomalous patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for machine learning models, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only uses well-known libraries and straightforward testing logic.",
