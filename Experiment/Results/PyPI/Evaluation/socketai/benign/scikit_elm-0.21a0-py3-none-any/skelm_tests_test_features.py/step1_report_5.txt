{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the skelm library's ELMClassifier and ELMRegressor classes using pytest framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, sklearn.datasets, and skelm library components.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present; testing code executes model fitting and scoring functions.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Test functions -> Model creation -> Fitting and scoring -> Assertions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and machine learning datasets, then defines parameterized tests for model behavior. It creates models with different neuron counts, trains them, and compares scores. It also tests model partial fitting with 'forget' parameter, simulating incremental learning. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. Usage appears to be straightforward unit testing of a machine learning library's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for machine learning models, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs typical data loading, model training, and evaluation procedures without suspicious behavior.",
