{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the ELMClassifier and ELMRegressor models, verifying neuron configuration and forgetting behavior.",
  "sources": "Data loading from sklearn.datasets (load_iris, load_boston), model instantiation, and partial fitting methods.",
  "sinks": "Score evaluations and assertions; no external data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, models are trained, and scores are evaluated within the test functions; no external or untrusted data flows outside the test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for machine learning models, involving data loading, model configuration, training, and evaluation. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor inconsistency is in one report assigning a security risk score of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the benign nature of the code. All other indicators confirm the code's safety and purpose as testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured testing code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk score should be set to 0 across all reports, and malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
