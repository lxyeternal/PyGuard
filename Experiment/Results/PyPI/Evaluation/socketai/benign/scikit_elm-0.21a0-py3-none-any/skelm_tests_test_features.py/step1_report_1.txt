{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality and behavior of ELMClassifier and ELMRegressor models from the skelm library, specifically testing neuron configuration and forgetting behavior.",
  "sources": "Loads datasets using sklearn.datasets.load_iris and load_boston, and reads data during fit, partial_fit, and score method calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to model.fit(), model.partial_fit(), and model.score() which process data. No data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from datasets -> passed into model methods (fit, partial_fit, score) -> results are compared in assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code follows typical testing structure with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing libraries (pytest), sklearn datasets, and a third-party neural network package (skelm). It performs parameterized tests to verify model training and forgetting behavior. All operations involve standard data processing, model training, and evaluation. There are no code injections, network communications, or data exfiltration activities. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a machine learning library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It purely tests model functionality and correctness without any security risks.",
