  "purpose": "Unit tests for ELMClassifier and ELMRegressor models, validating neuron configuration and forgetting mechanism.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest and scikit-learn datasets; usage of dataset loading functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system state or leaks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset load to model training and scoring, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard testing and ML library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing of machine learning models using pytest. It loads datasets, configures models with fixed random states, and evaluates model scores. The tests involve setting neurons manually and testing model forgetting behavior. All functions are from well-known libraries and follow conventional patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual behaviors. No data leakage, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for ML models, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
