{
  "purpose": "The code implements Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models for regression and classification, including support for multi-label and multi-class problems, with features for incremental learning and flexible neuron configuration.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are read from method parameters such as X and y in functions like partial_fit and predict; environment variables or external inputs are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "Predicted outputs are returned by predict methods; data transformations occur internally but do not directly leak data externally or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) through checks, transformations, and model computations within methods like partial_fit, fit, and predict. No external data sources or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard machine learning libraries and classes; no hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations are evident. There is some dynamic handling of parameters (lists, functions), but this is typical for flexible ML models. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of machine learning models using scikit-learn components. It features input validation, incremental fitting, flexible neuron configuration, and probability estimation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are observed. The use of warnings, dynamic class handling, and model attribute management are consistent with standard practices. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or security breaches. The design appears to be a legitimate ML pipeline with focus on extensibility and flexibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Extreme Learning Machines for regression and classification tasks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It leverages common libraries and adheres to typical ML code structure, posing no security risk based on the provided content.",
