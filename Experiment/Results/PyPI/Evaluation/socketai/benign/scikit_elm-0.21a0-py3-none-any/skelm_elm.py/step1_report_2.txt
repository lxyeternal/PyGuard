{
  "purpose": "This code implements Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) modules for regression and classification, including multi-label support, using neural network-like structures with various hidden layer configurations and solvers.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from parameters in methods such as partial_fit, fit, and predict. Data is checked and processed via scikit-learn utilities like check_X_y and check_array.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from input parameters through transformation steps into hidden layer computations and ultimately into the solver for model fitting and predictions, which may include internal model state updates.",
  "flows": "Data from input functions (partial_fit, fit, predict) is validated, then transformed via hidden layers, combined (if include_original_features), and passed to the solver for fitting or prediction. Class labels are processed with label binarizers and used to update model parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to implement standard machine learning procedures. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or privacy violations are present. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific and machine learning libraries, implements a neural network-like model with flexible hidden layer configurations, and includes typical methods for incremental learning (partial_fit) and prediction. It processes class labels with scikit-learn binarizers and supports multi-label classification. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code structure and comments indicate intended machine learning functionalities without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Extreme Learning Machines for regression and classification with multi-label support. It uses standard libraries and practices for data handling, model training, and prediction. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in the provided code.",
