{
  "purpose": "The source code implements an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for regression and classification, supporting multi-neuron types, partial fitting, and integration with scikit-learn.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X and labels y during fit, partial_fit, and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Predict methods use untrusted input data to generate predictions; partial_fit and fit methods update internal models and parameters; predict_proba outputs probabilities based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from check_X_y and check_array functions (sources) to model training and prediction functions, then outputs are generated based on the trained model parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are observed. No obfuscated code, and the code does not perform any network connections or system modifications. Usage of warnings and standard sklearn utilities appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an ML model extending scikit-learn's framework. It includes data validation, batch processing, multiple neuron configurations, and model fitting/prediction routines. No malicious behavior or sabotage signs are detected. Functions for updating classes, partial training, and predictions rely on trusted sklearn utilities. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured machine learning model implementation without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Extreme Learning Machines for regression and classification with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It leverages standard libraries and does not perform any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
