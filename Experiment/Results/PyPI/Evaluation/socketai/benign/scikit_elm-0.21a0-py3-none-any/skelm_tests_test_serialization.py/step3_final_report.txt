{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for serializing and deserializing 'skelm' models and their components using pickle, verifying prediction consistency after serialization.",
  "sources": "Internal model attributes such as 'solver_' and 'hidden_layers_' during pickle dump/load operations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is serialized/deserialized within the test environment without external input or network activity.",
  "flows": "Pickle serialization of model components and subsequent deserialization, followed by prediction calls to verify integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; standard testing pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled serialization tests using pickle within a trusted environment. No external data or network activity is involved. The use of pickle is typical for model persistence but carries inherent risks if used with untrusted data; here, data is internally generated, minimizing risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of pickle in this controlled testing context is acceptable, and the scores accurately reflect the low security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
