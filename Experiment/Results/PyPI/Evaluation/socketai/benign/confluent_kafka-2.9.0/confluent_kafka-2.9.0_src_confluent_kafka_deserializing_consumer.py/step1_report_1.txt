{
  "purpose": "Define a high-level Kafka consumer with deserialization capabilities for keys and values, supporting custom deserializers.",
  "sources": "Confidential configuration dictionary 'conf' containing deserializer callables, message attributes (topic, headers, key, value).",
  "sinks": "Deserialized data returned as message key and value, no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Configuration dict -> deserializer callables invoked during message polling -> deserialized key/value assigned back to message object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no suspicious data leaks or backdoors. Use of deserializers is standard, no malicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a consumer class extending a Kafka client implementation, adding deserialization logic for message keys and values. It processes messages, raises exceptions on errors, and overrides polling to include deserialization. The deserializer functions are provided via configuration and invoked with message data and context. No external data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or suspicious code is present. The code appears to be a straightforward extension of Kafka consumer functionality with proper error handling. No obfuscation or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a Kafka consumer with customizable deserialization, without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard patterns, focusing on safe deserialization of message data. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
