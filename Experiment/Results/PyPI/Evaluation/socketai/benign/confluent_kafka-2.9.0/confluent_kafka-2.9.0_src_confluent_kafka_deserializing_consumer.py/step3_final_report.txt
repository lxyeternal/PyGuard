  "purpose": "A high-level Kafka consumer with deserialization capabilities, allowing custom deserializer functions for keys and values, invoked during message polling.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary for deserializer functions; message topic, headers, key, and value during poll.",
  "sinks": "Deserialized key and value assigned back to the message object; potential data leaks if deserializers are malicious.",
  "flows": "Configuration provides deserializer functions -> poll() retrieves message -> deserializer functions invoked on message key/value -> deserialized data set back into message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity. Use of user-supplied deserializers is standard but can be risky if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a Kafka consumer to include deserialization logic, invoking user-provided functions with proper error handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of deserializer functions, which is a known pattern and outside the scope of this review. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious external calls or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Kafka consumer extension with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The primary security consideration is the trust in external deserializer functions, which is a common pattern but should be documented. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal security concern given the context.",
