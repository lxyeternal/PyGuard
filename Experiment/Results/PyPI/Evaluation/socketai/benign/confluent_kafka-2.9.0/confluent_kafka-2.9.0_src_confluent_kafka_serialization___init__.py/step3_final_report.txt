{
  "purpose": "This code provides serialization and deserialization classes for Kafka message data types (float, int, string), facilitating data encoding/decoding in Kafka clients.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to __call__ methods for serialization/deserialization (objects to bytes and bytes to objects).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow into serialization methods, producing bytes; bytes flow into deserialization methods, producing objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Kafka serialization/deserialization classes using Python's struct and enum modules. It handles data types like float, int, and string with proper error handling. No external calls, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation are present. The functions operate solely on input parameters, returning serialized bytes or deserialized objects. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Kafka serialization/deserialization utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to a safe, transparent implementation suitable for supply chain use.",
