{
  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes for handling Kafka client errors, serialization/deserialization errors, and related exceptions.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; imports from confluent_kafka library.",
  "sinks": "Error handling and exception raising within the class constructors.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with KafkaError instances and optional exception or message objects; errors are propagated through inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code strictly implements exception classes for Kafka errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes that extend existing Kafka-related exception classes. Each class wraps specific Kafka errors and optional related info, such as original exceptions or Kafka messages. The implementation adheres to standard Python exception handling practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. The code does not perform network operations, data processing, or any side effects beyond error encapsulation. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and purely for error management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Kafka client error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe for its intended purpose.",
