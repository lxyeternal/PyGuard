{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for Kafka client error handling, wrapping KafkaError instances and related info for standardized error management.",
  "sources": "Error creation points within the exception constructors, wrapping KafkaError objects and optional Kafka messages or exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; error objects are instantiated locally without external input or output.",
  "flows": "Error objects are created from internal KafkaError instances; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for error handling, inheriting from standard Kafka exception classes. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data beyond wrapping errors. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The exception classes serve as wrappers for Kafka errors, which is a common pattern. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for Kafka error handling. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
