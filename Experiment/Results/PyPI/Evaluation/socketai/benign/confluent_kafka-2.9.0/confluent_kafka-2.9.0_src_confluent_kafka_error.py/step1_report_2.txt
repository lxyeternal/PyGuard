  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling Kafka client errors, serialization/deserialization errors, and related exceptions.",
  "sources": "None (error class definitions do not read input or data from external sources).",
  "sinks": "None (error classes do not process untrusted data for output or system effects).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink; classes serve as error wrappers).",
  "anomalies": "Use of inheritance from KafkaException and SerializationError; no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to handle various Kafka-related errors by extending existing exception classes. It includes custom error classes for consumption, production, and serialization/deserialization errors, with properties to access error codes and names. There are no indications of malicious activity, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The classes do not perform network operations, data handling, or system modifications. The purpose appears to be error handling and wrapping for Kafka client interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Kafka client error management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is safe and typical for such application-level error handling.",
