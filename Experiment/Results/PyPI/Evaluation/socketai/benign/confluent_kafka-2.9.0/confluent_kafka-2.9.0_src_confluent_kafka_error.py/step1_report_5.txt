  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Kafka client errors, including errors during message consumption, production, serialization, and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the parameters passed to exception constructors, such as kafka_error, exception, and kafka_message.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling logic could potentially log or process error information; no explicit sinks such as network calls or file writes are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Errors originating from Kafka operations are wrapped into custom exception classes, propagating error information through the application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code follows standard exception wrapping patterns for Kafka client errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for Kafka client errors, such as ConsumeError, ProduceError, and their serialization/deserialization variants. All classes inherit from KafkaException or other custom classes, wrapping error details like KafkaError instances, original exceptions, and Kafka messages. The constructor methods initialize parent classes with error details without performing any network operations, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is to handle and encapsulate error information. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Kafka client error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no signs of obfuscation or malware. The code appears safe and intended solely for error management within Kafka-related Python applications.",
