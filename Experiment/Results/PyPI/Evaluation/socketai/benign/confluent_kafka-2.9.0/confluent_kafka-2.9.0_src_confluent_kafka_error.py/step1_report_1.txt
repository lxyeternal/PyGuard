  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Kafka client error handling, wrapping Kafka errors and serialization/deserialization issues.",
  "sources": "Error objects and KafkaError instances used during exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Attributes like exception and kafka_message could potentially expose error details but are not used as data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Errors originating from Kafka operations are wrapped into custom exceptions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks appears in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic detected. All classes are standard exception wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from KafkaError and other exceptions, used for error handling in Kafka clients. Each class appropriately wraps Kafka error details and optionally includes additional exception or message info. There are no data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling in this code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code appears to serve as a clean, straightforward error wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard exception wrapping for Kafka client errors without any malicious intent or suspicious functionality. It is a typical error handling implementation with no security concerns identified.",
