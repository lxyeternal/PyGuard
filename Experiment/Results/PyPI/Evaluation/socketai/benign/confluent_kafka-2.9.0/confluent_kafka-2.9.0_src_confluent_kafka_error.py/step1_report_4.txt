{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in Kafka client operations, including error wrapping for consumption, production, deserialization, and serialization errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiation and method calls related to KafkaError, Exception, and Kafka message objects during error handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing or external communications are present. Error objects are instantiated and stored internally.",
  "flows": "Errors encountered during Kafka operations are wrapped into custom exception classes, with no external data flows or untrusted inputs directed to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic or external communication mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to handle Kafka errors through custom exception classes, wrapping underlying errors and optional message data. It uses standard exception handling and class inheritance patterns. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions, are present. The code appears to be a typical error handling module for a Kafka client library, with appropriate use of inheritance and property decorators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for Kafka client error handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates error management without performing any external or sensitive operations.",
