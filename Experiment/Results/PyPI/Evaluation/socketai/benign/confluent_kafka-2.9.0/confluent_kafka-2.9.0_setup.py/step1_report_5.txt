  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python C extension module for confluent_kafka.",
  "sources": "File system reads to determine directories and source files; platform.system() call.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is used directly in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A, primarily build configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded library names are platform-specific but expected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the current working directory, constructs paths to source files, and defines a C extension module for building the confluent_kafka Python package component. It uses platform.system() to select the correct library name for rdkafka. The setup call is standard for building C extensions with setuptools. No user input, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code performs expected setup procedures for a Python extension module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a C extension module and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply manages build configuration with platform-specific adjustments.",
