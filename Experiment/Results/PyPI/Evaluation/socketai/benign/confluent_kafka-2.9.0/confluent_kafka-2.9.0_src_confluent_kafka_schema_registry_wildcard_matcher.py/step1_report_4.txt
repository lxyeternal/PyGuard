{
  "purpose": "Provides wildcard pattern matching functions for strings, supporting patterns with '?' and '*' wildcards, including recursive '**' patterns across name boundaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'text' and 'matcher' in the function 'wildcard_match'. No external or untrusted data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "Uses 're.compile' and 'fullmatch' to process the matching patterns. No data is sent externally, stored insecurely, or executed in a way that could lead to injection.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into '_wildcard_to_regexp' for pattern conversion, which then generates a regex pattern compiled and matched against 'text'. No external effects or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic. Pattern conversion functions handle wildcards and escape sequences normally without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a string pattern matching utility supporting complex wildcard patterns. It converts wildcard patterns into regular expressions with careful escaping of special characters. The use of regex is standard and safe in this context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward and do not execute untrusted data as code. The code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to typical pattern matching implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of wildcard pattern matching using regular expressions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
