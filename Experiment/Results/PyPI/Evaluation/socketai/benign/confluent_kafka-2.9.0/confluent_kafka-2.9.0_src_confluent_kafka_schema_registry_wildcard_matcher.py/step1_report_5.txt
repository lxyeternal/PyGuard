{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for matching strings against wildcard patterns using regular expressions, primarily for pattern matching tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'text' and 'matcher' in the 'wildcard_match' function, which are user-provided strings for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "The code compiles regex patterns and performs pattern matching; no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted into regex patterns via '_wildcard_to_regexp' and '_double_slashes' functions, then matched using 'fullmatch'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The functions perform straightforward pattern translation and matching.",
  "analysis": "The code converts wildcard patterns with '?' and '*' (including '**') into regex patterns, escaping special characters appropriately. The pattern matching process is standard and does not involve any external data sources, network calls, or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The functions are well-structured, with clear logic and comments. The only data processing involves pattern conversion and matching, which are safe operations. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate utility purpose without any malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for pattern matching using wildcards, with no evidence of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard regex translation and matching safely.",
