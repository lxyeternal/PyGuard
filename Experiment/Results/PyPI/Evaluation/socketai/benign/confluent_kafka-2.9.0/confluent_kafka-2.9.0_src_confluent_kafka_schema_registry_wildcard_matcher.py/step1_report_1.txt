{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for matching strings against wildcard patterns using custom regex conversion, primarily for pattern matching tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters `text` and `matcher` in `wildcard_match`, internal variables in `_wildcard_to_regexp` and `_double_slashes` functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to network, filesystem, or external systems. No execution of untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "Input `text` and `matcher` are converted into regex pattern; `wildcard_match` returns a boolean based on regex match. No flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses complex regex conversion for wildcard patterns but does not include any malicious or suspicious code such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No insecure operations or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to convert wildcard patterns with special characters ('*', '?', '**') into regex patterns and then matches input text against these patterns. It handles escaping regex metacharacters, processing double asterisks, and properly escaping backslashes. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for pattern matching with no network, file, or system manipulation. No suspicious or anomalous code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for pattern matching using wildcards, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is well-structured and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
