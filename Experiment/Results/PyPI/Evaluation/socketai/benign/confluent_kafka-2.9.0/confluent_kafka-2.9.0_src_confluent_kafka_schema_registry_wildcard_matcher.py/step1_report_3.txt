{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to perform wildcard pattern matching on strings using custom rules similar to shell globbing, supporting patterns like '?', '*', and '**'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the functions 'wildcard_match' and '_wildcard_to_regexp', specifically 'text' and 'matcher'.",
  "sinks": "The 're.compile' and 'pattern.fullmatch' calls that compile regex patterns and match text, respectively.",
  "flows": "The 'matcher' pattern is converted into a regex pattern via '_wildcard_to_regexp', then compiled and used to match 'text' in 'wildcard_match'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward regex pattern conversion and matching.",
  "analysis": "The code converts wildcard patterns with '?', '*', and '**' into regular expressions for string matching. The functions use standard Python modules and techniques, with careful handling of special characters and escape sequences. No hardcoded secrets, external data inputs, or network operations are present. The pattern conversion logic appears correct and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of pattern matching logic, intended for string pattern matching purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, and the regex conversion appears safe and correct.",
