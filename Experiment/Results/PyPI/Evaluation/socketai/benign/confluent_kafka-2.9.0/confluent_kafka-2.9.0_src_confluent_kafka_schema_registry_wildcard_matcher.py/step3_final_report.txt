  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting wildcard patterns ('*', '?', '**') into regular expressions and matching strings against these patterns.",
  "sources": "Input strings to match against patterns, pattern strings to convert into regex.",
  "sinks": "Regex pattern compilation and matching functions, no external data or system calls.",
  "flows": "Pattern string is converted to regex via _wildcard_to_regexp, then pattern.fullmatch is used to match input text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with proper escaping and handling of wildcards.",
  "analysis": "The code provides pattern matching utilities converting wildcard patterns to regex, handling special characters and escaping correctly. It does not perform any external operations, network activity, or system modifications. The functions are standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The regex conversion logic is correct, and the matching is performed securely. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is clear, and its implementation is standard for pattern matching tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for wildcard pattern matching. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, with no malicious or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
