  "purpose": "Provides a wildcard matching function for fully-qualified names using custom rules involving '?', '*', and '**' with regex conversion.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' and 'matcher' in the function 'wildcard_match', and internal pattern processing functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly into system commands, network, or sensitive data storage.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed into regex patterns, compiled, and used for matching; no data flows into external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses complex regex conversion for wildcard patterns but does not contain obvious anomalies or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a regex-based wildcard matching system supporting '?', '*', and '**' with custom rules for name boundary matching. The functions convert patterns to regex, handling special characters and escaping as needed. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears well-structured, and the regex translation logic is clear and contained. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a utility purpose for pattern matching with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data locally to perform pattern matching without external interactions or security-sensitive operations.",
