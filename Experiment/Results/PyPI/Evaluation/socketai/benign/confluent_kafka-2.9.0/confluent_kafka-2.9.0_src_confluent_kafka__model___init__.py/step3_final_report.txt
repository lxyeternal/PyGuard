{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and enums for Kafka client management, including nodes, consumer groups, topics, partitions, election types, and isolation levels.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and enum attribute definitions; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Static data definitions; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecated typo 'UNKOWN' instead of 'UNKNOWN' in ConsumerGroupState enum.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum definitions for Kafka entities, relying on an external 'cimpl' module for constants. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The only anomaly is the deprecated typo 'UNKOWN', which is documented and not malicious. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reliance on 'cimpl' appears standard. Overall, the code is a static data model with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The only minor issue is the deprecated typo 'UNKOWN', which does not impact security but should be corrected in future versions.",
