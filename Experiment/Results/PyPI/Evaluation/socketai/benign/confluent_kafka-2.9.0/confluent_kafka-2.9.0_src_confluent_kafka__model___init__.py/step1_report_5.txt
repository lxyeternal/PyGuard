{
  "purpose": "Defines various classes and enums related to Kafka consumer groups, nodes, topics, partitions, and election types for use in Kafka client operations.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input data; mainly class constructors and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to security effects; no data output or external communication found.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly declares data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in enum attribute 'UNKOWN' (should be 'UNKNOWN'), which is deprecated but does not pose security risk; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and enums for Kafka consumer groups, nodes, and partitions, using a cimpl module for constants. There is no user input handling, no network communication, and no processing of untrusted data. The typo in the enum attribute 'UNKOWN' is noted but is a benign deprecation detail. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscation or hidden functionality detected. The overall code appears to be standard, well-structured SDK code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of a Kafka client library, defining data classes and enums for internal use. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The only minor issue is a typo in the deprecated enum attribute, which does not impact security.",
