  "purpose": "Define classes and enums related to Kafka consumer groups, topics, and partition info for internal use in a Kafka client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from class constructor parameters such as id, host, port, group_id, topic_names, and other attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters into class attributes; there are no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a deprecated typo 'UNKOWN' for the enum value 'UNKNOWN', referencing a possibly unintended typo; no other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data classes and enums representing Kafka entities and states. It imports cimpl from a relative module, likely internal. No dynamic execution, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only notable issue is the deprecated typo 'UNKOWN' which may cause confusion but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of class definitions and enum declarations for Kafka client state representations. It does not contain any malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors. The only minor concern is the deprecated typo in an enum, which is not malicious but should be updated.",
