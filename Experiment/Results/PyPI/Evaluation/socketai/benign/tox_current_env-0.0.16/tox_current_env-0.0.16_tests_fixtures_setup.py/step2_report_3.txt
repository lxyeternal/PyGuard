  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the corresponding code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal setup script: importing setuptools and calling setup() with static, hardcoded package name and empty extras_require dictionaries.\n- No dynamic code, no external data, no network operations, no code execution, no obfuscated code, and no hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code is a standard, benign package configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report scores are 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All report scores are 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All are 0.0, justified by the absence of any risky behavior.\n\n### Justification for any high risk scores:\n- Since all assessments agree on the benign nature, no higher scores are warranted.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the evaluations.\n\n**However, considering the potential for malicious code in package setup scripts, I will provide my own estimates:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware            | 0.0     | No malicious behavior, code is static and benign.                                           |\n| obfuscated         | 0.0     | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                              |\n| securityRisk       | 0.0     | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.                                              |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAll scores should remain at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The confidence remains at 1.0, as the analysis is definitive.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The reports are accurate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.",
