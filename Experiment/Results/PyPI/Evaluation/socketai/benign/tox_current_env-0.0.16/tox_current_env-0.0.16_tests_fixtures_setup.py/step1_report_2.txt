  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and its parameters, which include package name and optional dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies without data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard package setup configuration with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with minimal arguments: package name and optional dependencies. The 'extras_require' dictionary is empty for 'dev' and 'full' options, indicating placeholders rather than actual dependency specifications. There are no suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious constructs present. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears safe for use.",
