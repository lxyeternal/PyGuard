  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration with optional dependencies",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data for package setup, primarily from the 'setuptools' import and the setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply executes static configuration",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The extras_require fields are empty lists, which is normal",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with minimal parameters, specifying the package name and optional dependencies as empty lists. No external input processing, no code execution, no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign, standard setup script.",
