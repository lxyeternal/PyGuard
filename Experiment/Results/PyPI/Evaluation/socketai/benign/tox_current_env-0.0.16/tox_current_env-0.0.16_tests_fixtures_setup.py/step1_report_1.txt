  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'test' with optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name and optional dependencies in 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is straightforward package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The setup script appears minimal and standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package setup with a name and optional dependencies. It does not include dynamic code execution, network operations, or other typical malicious behaviors. The dependencies are empty lists, indicating no extra payloads or malicious dependencies are introduced. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
