  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with no dependencies or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name and optional dependencies; no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with empty dependency lists and no dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs. The extras_require fields are empty, indicating no dependencies or payloads. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this benign nature, assigning high confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The analysis is consistent and accurate, with no logical flaws or assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
