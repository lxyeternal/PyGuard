  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'tox-current-env' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file feeds into the long_description parameter; setup parameters are static and do not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to follow standard Python packaging conventions with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, reads a README file for the description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It uses static values and straightforward function calls without dynamic code execution, external data processing, or untrusted inputs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code is typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided content.",
