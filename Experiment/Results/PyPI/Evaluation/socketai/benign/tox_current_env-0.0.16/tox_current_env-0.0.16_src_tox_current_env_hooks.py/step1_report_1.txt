{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports different modules based on the version of the 'tox' package, likely to handle compatibility across different versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'TOX_VERSION' from the 'tox' package import, which provides version information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The source (TOX_VERSION) determines which module is imported; however, this is controlled by a package version, not external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a version check and conditional import, which is common for compatibility. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the '__version__' attribute from the 'tox' package and inspects its first character to determine the major version. Based on this, it conditionally imports specific modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The conditional import appears straightforward and intended for compatibility purposes. No external inputs influence this code beyond the package version, which is a controlled value.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check and conditional import pattern to handle different 'tox' versions. It does not exhibit any malicious activity or security risks. The overall risk is very low.",
