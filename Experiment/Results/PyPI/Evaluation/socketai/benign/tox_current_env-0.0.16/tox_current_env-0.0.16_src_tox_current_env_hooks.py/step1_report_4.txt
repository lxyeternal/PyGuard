{
  "purpose": "Dynamically import modules based on the version of the 'tox' package installed, to ensure compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'tox' package's __version__ attribute to determine which module to import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or data leakage points; only conditional import statements.",
  "flows": "The version string from 'tox' is used to select which module to import, but this does not lead to external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on the first character of the version string for comparison, which assumes version strings are formatted starting with a digit. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets present. No unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from the 'tox' package to check its first character. Based on this, it conditionally imports modules for different tox versions. The version check is simplistic but straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The logic is for compatibility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign version-based import selection mechanism. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs a basic version check to decide which modules to import, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
