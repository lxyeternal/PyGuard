  "purpose": "Dynamically import different modules based on the version of the 'tox' package.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__' attribute from the 'tox' package.",
  "sinks": "Import statements based on version check, which could lead to dynamic code execution if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Read 'TOX_VERSION' -> Check first character -> Import module accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version string to determine import path; potential for version-based dynamic import, but no evidence of malicious behavior in current code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the '__version__' attribute from the 'tox' package and checks the first character of this version string. Based on whether it equals '4', it conditionally imports either 'tox_current_env.hooks4' or 'tox_current_env.hooks3'. These are straightforward conditional imports, with no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation. The dynamic import is based solely on a version check, which is a common pattern for compatibility handling. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are present. The code is simple and adheres to normal version-based module loading practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a version check and conditional import, which is standard practice for managing compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
