  "purpose": "Import and conditionally load modules based on the version of the 'tox' package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'tox.__version__' string to determine the version of the package.",
  "sinks": "Import statements potentially loading different modules based on version.",
  "flows": "Reading 'TOX_VERSION' -> Conditional check -> Import of version-specific modules.",
  "anomalies": "Simple version-based import logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the version string of the 'tox' package and checks the first character to decide which set of hooks to import. This is a straightforward version check with conditional imports. No data leaks, secret handling, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be designed for compatibility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard version check and conditional import, which is common practice for maintaining compatibility across different package versions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
