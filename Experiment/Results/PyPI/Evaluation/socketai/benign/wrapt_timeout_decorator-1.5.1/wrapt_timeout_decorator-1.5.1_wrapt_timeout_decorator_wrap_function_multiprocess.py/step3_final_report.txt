{
  "purpose": "Provides a mechanism to execute functions asynchronously with a timeout using multiprocessing, managing subprocess lifecycle, signals, and IPC.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the wrapped function arguments, subprocess start, and signal handling setup.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises exceptions; communicates results via pipes; terminates processes if needed.",
  "flows": "Source: wrapped function arguments -> subprocess execution -> result or exception sent via pipe -> main process receives and processes result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Signal resets are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code manages subprocess creation, signal resetting, IPC via pipes, and exception propagation. No external network activity or data leaks are present. The implementation follows standard patterns for process timeout management. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The signal handling and process control are appropriate and typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for managing function execution with timeouts. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The supply chain risk is minimal.",
