  "purpose": "The code provides a class to run functions asynchronously with a timeout feature, managing subprocesses, signals, and inter-process communication.",
  "sources": "Reads from import statements, class methods, and subprocess communication channels (pipes).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations include raising exceptions, process termination, and communication over pipes which could leak exception info or control flow.",
  "flows": "Input data (function calls, signals) flow into subprocess execution; results or exceptions flow back via pipes; subprocess control (start, terminate) flows through process management methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiprocessing for asynchronous execution is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations are present. Exception handling is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Timeout class to run functions in subprocesses with timeout control, involving process creation, signal resetting, and inter-process communication via pipes. It manages subprocess lifecycle, checks for result readiness, and handles cancellation and exception forwarding. The helper functions reset signals and manage subprocess behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious control flow is observed. Communication channels are used for standard IPC, with no indication of data exfiltration. All subprocess and signal handling appears to serve standard timeout and cleanup purposes. No suspicious external connections or credential handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a secure and standard approach to executing functions with a timeout mechanism using subprocesses and multiprocessing. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is detected. It primarily manages subprocess execution, signaling, and communication for timeout enforcement. The overall security risk is low.",
