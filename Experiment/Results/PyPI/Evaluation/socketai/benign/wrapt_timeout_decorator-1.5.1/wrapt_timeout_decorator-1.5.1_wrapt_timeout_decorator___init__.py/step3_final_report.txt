  "purpose": "Import functions and assign package metadata variables from internal configuration modules.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from local modules and configuration data from __init__conf__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow through module imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports and a comment about circular import issues are standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and assignment of metadata variables from a configuration module. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data flow from untrusted sources is present. The code is typical for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The comments indicate awareness of circular import issues, which is standard practice. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and appropriate.",
