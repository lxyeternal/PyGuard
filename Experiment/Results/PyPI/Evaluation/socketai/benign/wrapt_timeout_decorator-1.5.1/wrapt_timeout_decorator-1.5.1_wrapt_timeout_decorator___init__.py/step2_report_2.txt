  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as standard import statements and assignment of configuration variables.\n- No external data flows, user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The code snippets are typical for Python package setup, managing internal imports and metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code relies on relative imports, which is common in package structures.\n- The comment about circular import issues indicates developer awareness, not malicious behavior.\n- All scores assigned are 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n- The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward import and assignment pattern.\n- The security risk score is 0, appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, setting up module imports and metadata.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, standard package setup code with no security concerns.",
