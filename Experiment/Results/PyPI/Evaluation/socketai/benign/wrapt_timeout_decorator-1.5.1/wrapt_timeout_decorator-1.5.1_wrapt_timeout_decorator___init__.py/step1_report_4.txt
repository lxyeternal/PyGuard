  "purpose": "Import helper functions and configuration constants for the module.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: wrapt_timeout_decorator, wrap_helper, and __init__conf__.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward imports and attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules, likely for timeout handling and object detection, and then assigns configuration variables from a module named __init__conf__. The order of imports suggests awareness of potential circular dependencies on Windows. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve configuration and setup purposes, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module setup tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not include any malicious or suspicious constructs.",
