{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions from internal modules and sets package metadata, likely for configuring or initializing a Python package or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from .wrapt_timeout_decorator, .wrap_helper, and __init__conf__; accesses attributes from __init__conf__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input or data flows leading to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules potentially used elsewhere; no direct data flow evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Circular import comment suggests awareness of import structure issues; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports and assigns package metadata variables using values from an internal configuration module. The import statements are standard, and the comment about circular imports indicates developer awareness. No functions, input processing, or data handling occurs here. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns detected. The code appears to be standard package setup or configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package metadata assignment and internal import code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
