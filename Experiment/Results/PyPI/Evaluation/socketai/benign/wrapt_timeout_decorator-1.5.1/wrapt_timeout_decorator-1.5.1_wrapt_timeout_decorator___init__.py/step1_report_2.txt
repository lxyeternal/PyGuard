  "purpose": "Import specific functions and configuration variables from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, including functions and configuration variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into local namespace but does not involve untrusted data or external effects",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. The comment about circular import is typical. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to timeout handling and unpickable object detection from local modules, and then imports configuration data from an internal configuration module. The comment indicates awareness of import order issues, which is normal. The code does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import section with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger project managing configuration and utility functions, with no security concerns identified.",
