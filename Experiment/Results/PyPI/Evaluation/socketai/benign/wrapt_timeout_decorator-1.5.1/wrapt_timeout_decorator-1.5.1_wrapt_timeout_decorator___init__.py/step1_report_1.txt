  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules and assign module metadata variables from a configuration module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, including functions and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flow points that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from module files into the current namespace; no external data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports and module-level configuration assignments are standard; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed. The comment indicates awareness of circular imports but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports, including functions from sibling modules and configuration variables from a configuration module. The comment notes a reason for import order related to circular dependencies. The metadata variables are assigned from a configuration module. All code appears to be standard Python import and assignment statements without obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module import pattern for organizing a Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity. The structure is standard, and there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
