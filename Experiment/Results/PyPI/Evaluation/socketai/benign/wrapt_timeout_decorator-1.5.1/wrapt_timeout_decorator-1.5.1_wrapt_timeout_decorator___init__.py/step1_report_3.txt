{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from internal modules and sets package metadata variables, likely for a Python package related to timeout handling and object detection.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .wrapt_timeout_decorator, .wrap_helper, and .__init__conf__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects; metadata variables are assigned from configuration constants",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports within a package, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports and assigns package metadata variables from a configuration module. It uses relative imports, which are common in package structures. No external data input, command execution, or network communication is present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on internal package setup without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a Python package setup, importing functions and setting metadata. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
