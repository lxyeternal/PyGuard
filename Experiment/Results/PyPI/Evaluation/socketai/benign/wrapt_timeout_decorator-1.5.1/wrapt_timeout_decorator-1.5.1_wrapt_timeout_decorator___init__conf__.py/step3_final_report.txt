  "purpose": "Static package metadata and informational print function for 'wrapt_timeout_decorator'.",
  "sources": "Definition of static variables and the print_info() function; no external inputs or data flows.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static metadata variables and a simple print function. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static, and informational. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely documentation, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata script with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
