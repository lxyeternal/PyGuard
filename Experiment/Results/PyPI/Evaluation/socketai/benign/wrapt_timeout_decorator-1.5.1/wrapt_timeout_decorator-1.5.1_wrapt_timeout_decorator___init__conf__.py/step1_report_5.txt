  "purpose": "Provide information about the wrapt_timeout_decorator package, including its description, version, URL, author, and contact email.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package metadata (name, title, version, url, author, email, shell_command). No input reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only defines variables and a function that prints static information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hidden logic, or suspicious behavior. The print_info function merely outputs static info.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata in variables and defines a function to print that info. It contains no input handling, data processing, or external calls beyond the print statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve a documentation or informational purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely informational, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply stores package info and provides a function to display it.",
