  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of static metadata variables (name, title, version, url, author, author_email, shell_command).\n- It includes a simple function `print_info()` that outputs this metadata.\n- There are no external inputs, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be intended for documentation or informational purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward with no obfuscation.\n- **Data flow or external inputs:** None; all data is static.\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as static, benign, metadata, and informational.\n- They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, no external data handling, and no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Any discrepancies or points of critique:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero; no malicious code is present.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are zero, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a benign, static, informational script with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
