  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and an informational function for the 'wrapt_timeout_decorator' package, mainly for display or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sink operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables into the print_info() function, which outputs package information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata such as name, title, version, URL, author, and email. It includes a function that prints this information. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, no network operations, and no security-sensitive code. The structure is simple and intended for documentation or display purposes only. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected.",
