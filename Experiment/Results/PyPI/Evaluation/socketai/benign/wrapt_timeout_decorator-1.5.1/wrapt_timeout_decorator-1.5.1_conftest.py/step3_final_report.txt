{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest to load initial conftest files and optionally add extra command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'args' from pytest, which may include command-line inputs; 'early_config' and 'parser' are configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'args' list in-place, which could influence pytest's behavior if 'additional_pytest_args' were populated with untrusted data in future modifications.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'args', combines it with 'additional_pytest_args' (currently empty), and updates 'args' with the union, affecting pytest's startup arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The 'additional_pytest_args' list is initialized but remains empty; the 'collect_ignore' list is defined but unused. No external data or secrets are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest hook that modifies the argument list by union with an empty list, resulting in no change. It does not process external input, perform network or file I/O, or execute code based on untrusted data. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior is present. The logic is safe, standard, and static, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration snippet with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all of which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
