  "purpose": "Defines classes with methods decorated with timeout decorators that evaluate expressions involving class attributes to determine timeout durations.",
  "sources": "Class attribute references within the string expressions evaluated by the timeout decorator.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of string expressions involving 'instance.x' which could be exploited if 'instance.x' is influenced by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Class attribute 'x' is evaluated in the decorator's expression; if 'x' is manipulated externally, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'dec_allow_eval=True' with string expressions; no external input or data leaks; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes with methods decorated to evaluate simple expressions involving class attributes. The use of 'dec_allow_eval=True' permits eval of these expressions, which is safe here due to static attribute references. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. The primary risk lies in potential external manipulation of class attributes, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if 'x' is influenced by untrusted sources. However, in this static example, no such manipulation occurs. The code's behavior is benign, with no network activity or data leaks. The use of eval in this context is controlled and limited to attribute references, making it low risk in this scenario.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and contains no malware. The use of eval via 'dec_allow_eval=True' introduces a potential security risk if class attributes are externally influenced, but in this static example, it poses minimal danger. The scores are appropriately low: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a slight security risk (~0.2) due to eval usage. Overall, the code is benign with controlled eval, and no malicious intent is detected.",
