{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, without any intended functional behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string and tuple assignments for version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data flow to sensitive operations exists.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version strings are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code features are present; the code is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables, sets static version strings and tuples, and uses conditional imports for type checking. All code is static, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be auto-generated and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
