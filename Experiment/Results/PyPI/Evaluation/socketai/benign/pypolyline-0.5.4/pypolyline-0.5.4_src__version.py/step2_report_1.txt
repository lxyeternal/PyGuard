  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate the details:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a standard version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code uses static assignments, conditional import for type hints, and contains no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- No network operations, external data, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code.\n   - The code is benign, serving only as metadata for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reports:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in any report.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as standard version metadata.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Estimated scores based on the review:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Rationale:**\n  - The code is a typical, generated version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n  - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malware indications. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature as a standard, auto-generated version metadata snippet.",
