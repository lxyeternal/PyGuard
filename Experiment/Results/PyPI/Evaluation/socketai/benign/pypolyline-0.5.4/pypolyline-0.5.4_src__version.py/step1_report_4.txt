{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, primarily generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from hardcoded string and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or leads to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version data is static and assigned locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only assigns static version information. The TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains conditional import statements for type hints, which is a common pattern in Python packages. All version data is hardcoded and assigned directly to variables. No external input, no network operations, no sensitive data handling. The code is simple and standard, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. The presence of a generated comment indicates automated process, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version metadata assignment for a Python package with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
