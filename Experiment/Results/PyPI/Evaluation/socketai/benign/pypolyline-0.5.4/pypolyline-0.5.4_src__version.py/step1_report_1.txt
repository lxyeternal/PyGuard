  "purpose": "This code is generated by setuptools_scm to define version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, import statements under TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING import and conditional assignment is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables using static values. It employs standard typing constructs and conditional logic for type hints, which is typical in Python packages. No untrusted input, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
