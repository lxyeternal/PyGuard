  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is intended for version tracking and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version variables)",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The version string assignment flows from hardcoded string to module variables; no untrusted data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables for a package. It includes conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern for type hints without runtime impact. All assignments are static, hardcoded values. There are no external data reads, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard version metadata code with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
