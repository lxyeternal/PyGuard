  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, serving as metadata for versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string (__version__), static assignment of version tuple (__version_tuple__), conditional import for type checking (TYPE_CHECKING).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code involves static data assignments with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It employs static assignments for version strings and tuples, with a conditional import for type hints. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving only as version metadata. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The assigned scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
