  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static version declaration generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The code employs standard patterns (conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING) and static assignment of version info.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the benign assessment.\n\n**Confirmations and potential issues:**\n\n- The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; all reports correctly identify it as standard, auto-generated version info code.\n- The logic, reasoning, and conclusions in each report are sound and consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the straightforward, benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The malware score is 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, matching the overall benign assessment.\n\n**Any discrepancies or points to challenge?**\n\n- No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no security implications. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
