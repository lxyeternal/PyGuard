{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for polyline encoding and decoding functions from the pypolyline library",
  "sources": "Input data includes predefined coordinate lists and polyline byte strings; test functions read these variables and pass them to encoding/decoding functions",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; it only tests encoding/decoding internally",
  "flows": "Input coordinates and polyline strings flow into encoding and decoding functions; results are compared for correctness",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or malicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward test logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of polyline encoding and decoding functions, including round-trip tests and error handling. It defines test data, runs multiple iterations of encoding/decoding, and asserts correctness. No data leaks, external network actions, or malicious behaviors are observed. All operations are contained within the testing environment, focusing solely on verifying function correctness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for a polyline library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly tests functional correctness and error handling without external or harmful actions.",
