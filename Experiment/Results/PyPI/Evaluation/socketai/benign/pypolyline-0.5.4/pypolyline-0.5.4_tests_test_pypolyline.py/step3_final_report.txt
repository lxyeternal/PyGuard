  "purpose": "Unit tests for polyline encoding and decoding functions in the py_polyline library, verifying correctness, error handling, and robustness.",
  "sources": "Static test data within the test methods, including predefined polylines and coordinate lists.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks; all data flows are internal within the test functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (polylines and coordinates) into encoding/decoding functions; results are compared against expected values to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; extensive looping in 'testLongCoords' for performance testing is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite for polyline encoding/decoding functions. It uses static, hardcoded data with no external interactions or dynamic code execution. Error handling is properly tested with expected exceptions. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The extensive loop in 'testLongCoords' is typical for robustness testing, not malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing suite with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
