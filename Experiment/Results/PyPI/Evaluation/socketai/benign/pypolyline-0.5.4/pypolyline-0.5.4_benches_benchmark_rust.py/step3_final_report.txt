  "purpose": "Generate random geographic coordinates within London's bounding box and encode them repeatedly for testing or processing purposes.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform for coordinate generation, input coordinate list used in encode_coordinates",
  "sinks": "encode_coordinates function processes the coordinate list; no external data or network activity observed",
  "flows": "Generated coordinates are passed directly to encode_coordinates multiple times; no external data flow or output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with repeated encoding for testing, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code generates 1000 random coordinates within London's bounds using numpy, then encodes these coordinates 500 times in a loop. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious constructs are present. The libraries used are standard and benign. The repeated encoding appears to be for testing or benchmarking purposes. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code's behavior is consistent with benign data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing coordinate generation and encoding without malicious intent or suspicious activity. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1) are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
