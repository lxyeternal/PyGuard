  "purpose": "Generate random geographical coordinates within a specified bounding box and encode them repeatedly using a polyline encoding function.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform calls to generate latitude and longitude values",
  "sinks": "encode_coordinates function calls within the loop",
  "flows": "Random coordinate generation -> repeated encoding of coordinates",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No external network communication or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for generating random geographic coordinates within specified bounds (London area). It then encodes these coordinates 500 times using the encode_coordinates function from the pypolyline.cutil module. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious modifications. The repeated encoding seems to be for data processing or testing purposes. The dependencies are standard, and no suspicious behavior such as system access, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a coordinate generator and encoder without malicious intent. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
