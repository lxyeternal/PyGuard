  "purpose": "Generate random geographic coordinates within a specified bounding box and encode them using a polyline encoding function.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform for generating coordinates, input coordinates 'coords' passed to encode_coordinates function.",
  "sinks": "encode_coordinates function potentially processes the coordinates; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Random coordinate generation (source) -> encoding in loop (sink/function call).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code repeatedly encodes the same coordinate list without external influence or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script generates 1000 random geographic points within London's bounding box, then repeatedly encodes these coordinates 500 times using the 'encode_coordinates' function. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The function 'encode_coordinates' is imported from an external library and used solely for encoding purposes. There are no suspicious or malicious operations observed, nor any hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The loop repeats the encoding process but does not perform any other potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing random coordinate generation and encoding without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. No security risks or malware indications are evident based on this analysis.",
