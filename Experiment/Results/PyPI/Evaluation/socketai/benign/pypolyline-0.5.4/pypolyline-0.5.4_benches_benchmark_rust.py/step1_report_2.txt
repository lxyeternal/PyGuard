  "purpose": "Generate random geographic coordinates within a bounding box and encode them using a polyline encoding function.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables or external input (none explicitly); generating random coordinates internally.",
  "sinks": "Calling encode_coordinates() repeatedly with generated coordinates.",
  "flows": "Generated coords -> encode_coordinates() function call in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of random data generation is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and a utility function for encoding coordinates. It defines geographic bounds for London and generates 1000 random coordinate pairs within these bounds. It then encodes these coordinates 500 times in a loop, presumably for some form of encoding or processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoor functionalities. The repeated encoding appears to be for legitimate processing or testing purposes. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign script generating and encoding geographic data without any malicious intent or security risks. It is likely intended for testing or data processing related to map or route encoding.",
