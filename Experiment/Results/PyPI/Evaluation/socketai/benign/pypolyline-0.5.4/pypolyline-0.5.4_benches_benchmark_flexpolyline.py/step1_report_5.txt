  "purpose": "Generate encoded polyline strings from randomly generated geographic coordinates within London bounds for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform(S, N, [num_coords]) and np.random.uniform(W, E, [num_coords]) generate random coordinates within specified bounds.",
  "sinks": "fp.encode(coords, precision=5) encodes the coordinates; no data is sent externally or stored.",
  "flows": "Random coordinates are generated and then encoded repeatedly in a loop; no external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond random generation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs repetitive encoding without any user input or external data handling; no suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a polyline encoding library and numpy, then generates 1000 random coordinates within London bounding box. The main loop encodes these coordinates 500 times, possibly for testing or benchmarking. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be benign, focused solely on coordinate encoding. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code generates random geographic data and encodes it repeatedly, likely for testing purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
