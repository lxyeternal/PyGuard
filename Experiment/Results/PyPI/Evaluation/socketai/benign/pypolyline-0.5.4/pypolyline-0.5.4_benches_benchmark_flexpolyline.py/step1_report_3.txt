  "purpose": "Generate encoded polyline strings from random geographic coordinates within London bounding box.",
  "sources": "Reads randomly generated coordinate data stored in the 'coords' list.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'fp.encode' on the 'coords' data repeatedly; no data output or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Coordinates are generated and stored in 'coords' -> 'fp.encode' is called repeatedly with 'coords'. No data is sent externally or stored outside the script.",
  "anomalies": "Repeatedly encoding the same data without further processing; no apparent reason for multiple iterations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script generates 1000 random geographic coordinates within London's bounding box, then encodes this list into polyline strings 500 times in a loop. The 'flexpolyline' library is used, which is standard for polyline encoding. No external data transmission, no file I/O, no hidden code or obfuscation, and no suspicious operations are present. The repeated encoding may be inefficient but not malicious. No signs of malware such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system damage. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to geographic data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for generating encoded polylines from random London coordinates. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks identified.",
