  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate benchmarking utility with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is executing external code without validation, which could be risky if scripts are untrusted. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The overall security risk score should be set around 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of executing external scripts in an unvalidated environment."
