  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the current package or module using importlib.metadata",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs present",
  "flows": "The code reads the package name (__package__ or __name__) and retrieves its version via importlib.metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to fetch the package version dynamically using importlib.metadata. It handles the case where the package is not found by setting a default version '0.0.0'. The use of __package__ or __name__ is standard for package metadata retrieval, with exception handling for missing packages. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, standard operation to obtain package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
