  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flows or external effects",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version -> assigns to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library for version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the package version using importlib.metadata.version, which is a standard and safe approach. It handles the case where the package is not found, defaulting to '0.0.0'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. No external network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate snippet for obtaining package version information. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
