  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the current package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of __package__ or __name__ and attempts to get the package version using importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "The version string obtained could potentially be used elsewhere; however, there are no direct sinks for untrusted data or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input (__package__ or __name__) -> importlib.metadata.version() -> __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; standard pattern for obtaining package version.",
  "analysis": "The code safely attempts to get the version of the package using importlib.metadata, with a fallback to '0.0.0' if the package is not found. No untrusted input sources, no data leaks, and no malicious code behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and does not involve any dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, safe operation of retrieving package version information with proper exception handling. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
