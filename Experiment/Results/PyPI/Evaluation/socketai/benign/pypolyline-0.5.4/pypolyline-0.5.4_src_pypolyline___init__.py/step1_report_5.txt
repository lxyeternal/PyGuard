  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the current package using importlib.metadata",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version based on __package__ or __name__, fallback to '0.0.0' if package not found",
  "anomalies": "Standard pattern for version retrieval with fallback; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically fetch the package version using importlib.metadata. It correctly handles the case where the package is not found by assigning a default version '0.0.0'. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to typical Python package version retrieval patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval pattern with proper exception handling. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
