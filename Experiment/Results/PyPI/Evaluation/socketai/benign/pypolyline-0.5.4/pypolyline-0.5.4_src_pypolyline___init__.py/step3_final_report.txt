  "purpose": "Retrieve the current package or module version using importlib.metadata, with fallback to default version if not found.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "Source (importlib.metadata.version) to assignment of __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to obtain package version info, handling missing packages gracefully. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. It performs a benign operation, with proper exception handling, and does not leak data or perform external actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe, and standard implementation for obtaining package version information. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
