{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package or module",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version, __package__, __name__",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__) -> assigns to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the package version using importlib.metadata.version. It handles the case where __package__ might be None by falling back to __name__. If the package is not found, it assigns '0.0.0'. This is standard practice for retrieving package metadata and does not involve any malicious or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to obtain package version information, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
