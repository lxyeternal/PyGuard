  "purpose": "Generate and encode a large set of geographic coordinate data within a specified bounding box using polyline encoding.",
  "sources": "Random data generation using np.random.uniform for latitude and longitude within defined bounds.",
  "sinks": "polyline.encode function calls which process the generated coordinate data.",
  "flows": "Generated coordinate data (sources) are passed repeatedly into polyline.encode (sink) in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. The code simply generates random coordinates and encodes them multiple times.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes geographic bounds for London, creates 1000 random coordinate pairs within these bounds, and then repeatedly encodes these coordinates 500 times using the polyline library. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. The loop merely encodes the data repeatedly, which appears to be for performance testing or data processing, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate geographic data encoding without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be intended for generating or processing coordinate data, possibly for mapping purposes. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
