  "purpose": "Generate random geographical coordinate data within London bounds and encode it into polylines multiple times.",
  "sources": "Reading hardcoded geographic boundary coordinates, generating random coordinate data.",
  "sinks": "Calling polyline.encode() on the generated data repeatedly.",
  "flows": "Generation of coords from random functions -> encoding coords via polyline.encode() in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of untrusted input, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code or backdoors. The repeated encoding appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script defines London's bounding box and generates 1000 random coordinate points within this box using numpy. It then repeatedly encodes these points into polyline format 500 times inside the main block. There are no input sources outside of the fixed coordinates, no data leaks, and no network activity. The polyline library is standard for encoding geographic data. There are no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code flows. The code appears to be for data generation or processing rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign script for generating and encoding geographic coordinate data; it does not contain malware or security risks. It solely performs data processing with no suspicious or malicious actions.",
