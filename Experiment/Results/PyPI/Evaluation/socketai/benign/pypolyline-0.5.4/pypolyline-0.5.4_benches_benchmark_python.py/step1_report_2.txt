  "purpose": "Generate random geographical coordinate data within London bounds and encode them into polylines repeatedly.",
  "sources": "Reading fixed geographic boundary values; generating random coordinates using numpy's uniform function.",
  "sinks": "Calling polyline.encode on the generated coordinate list repeatedly.",
  "flows": "Random coordinate generation (sources) -> encoding via polyline.encode (sink) in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The code repeatedly encodes coordinates but does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines geographic bounds for London, generates 1000 random coordinate pairs within these bounds, and encodes these coordinates into polylines 500 times. The numpy library is used solely for uniform random number generation, and the polyline library is used for encoding the coordinate list. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, nor any system modifications. The repetitive encoding does not pose a security risk; it appears to be for data processing or testing purposes. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to generate and encode random geographic coordinates within London bounds for a likely benign purpose. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is observed.",
