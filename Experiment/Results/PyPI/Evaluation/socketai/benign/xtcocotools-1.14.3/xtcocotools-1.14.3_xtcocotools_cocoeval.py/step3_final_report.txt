{
  "purpose": "The code implements evaluation metrics for object detection and pose estimation on the COCO dataset, including IoU and OKS calculations, image-wise evaluation, and result summarization.",
  "sources": "Dataset annotations via COCO API, detection results, and internal data structures for ground truths and detections.",
  "sinks": "No external network or file operations; outputs are print statements and warnings for status updates.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset annotations and detection data; processes and matches detections to ground truths; computes IoU/OKS; aggregates results for summary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.stdout redirection in get_type_result() to suppress output during evaluation, which is benign and common for silent evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of COCO evaluation metrics, with clear data handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious code, and no external communication. The only unusual aspect is output suppression, which is a benign technique. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs dataset evaluation functions typical in computer vision benchmarks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured evaluation utility for COCO datasets, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor output suppression is a benign technique for silent evaluation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
