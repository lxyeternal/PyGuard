{
  "purpose": "This code implements the evaluation of object detection and pose estimation models using the COCO dataset metrics, including IoU and OKS computations, result aggregation, and reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset annotations, detection results, and detection scores; accesses image, category, and annotation data; processes detection and ground truth annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data leakage or insecure data handling; no network transmission, file writing, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Loads annotations -> prepares ground truth and detections -> computes IoU/OKS -> evaluates per image -> accumulates results -> summarizes metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses warnings and print statements for status updates. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of evaluation metrics for object detection, with methods to prepare data, compute IoU/OKS, evaluate images, accumulate results, and generate summaries. It relies on standard libraries and functions, with no indications of malicious intent. The 'split' method reads a JSON file and classifies image IDs; this is a normal operation for dataset management. No network operations or system modifications are present. The code's structure and comments suggest it is intended for benchmarking and performance analysis rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical evaluation script for object detection/pose estimation metrics with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs dataset loading, metric computation, and result reporting without insecure practices or harmful operations.",
