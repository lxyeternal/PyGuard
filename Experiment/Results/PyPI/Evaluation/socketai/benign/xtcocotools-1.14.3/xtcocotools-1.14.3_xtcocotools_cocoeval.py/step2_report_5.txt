  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard evaluation of detection/pose estimation models; reads dataset annotations, detection results, and scores.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of insecure data handling; flows are typical for evaluation pipelines.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Uses warnings and print statements for status updates, which are normal.  \n- **Analysis:** The code performs standard evaluation metrics, with functions for preparing data, computing IoU/OKS, evaluating images, and summarizing results. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate evaluation code, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (reasonable for a benign evaluation script, minimal risk)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (high confidence based on analysis)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar evaluation functions; reads annotations, detection results, and ground truths via COCO API.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks; standard processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; usage of warnings.warn and print statements are typical.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard evaluation procedures; no malicious behavior. The code's logic is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate evaluation utility, no malicious signs.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate, very low)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar evaluation code; reads dataset annotations, detection results, and performs IoU/OKS computations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data leakage.  \n- **Anomalies:** Uses sys.stdout redirection in `get_type_result()` to suppress output; benign, possibly for silent evaluation. No suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard evaluation process; no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe evaluation code.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements COCO evaluation; loads annotations, computes metrics, and summarizes.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; outputs are logs and internal metrics.  \n- **Anomalies:** Uses sys.stdout redirection during `get_type_result()` for silent evaluation; benign. No suspicious code detected.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard evaluation logic; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate evaluation framework.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; evaluation of detection results.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or insecure handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** Uses stdout redirection in `get_type_result()` to suppress output; benign.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard dataset evaluation code; no malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate evaluation code.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature as an evaluation utility, the risk is very low. The highest assigned is 0.2, which seems reasonable.  \n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree and the code is standard evaluation code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, as it is a benign evaluation script)  \n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured implementation of COCO evaluation metrics with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The minor use of stdout redirection is a common technique for silent evaluation and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable, and I agree with them. The code is safe, legitimate, and performs standard evaluation tasks without any malicious intent.",
