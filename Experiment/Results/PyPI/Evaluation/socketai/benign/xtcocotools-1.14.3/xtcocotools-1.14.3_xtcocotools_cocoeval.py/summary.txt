  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured evaluation utility for COCO datasets, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor output suppression is a benign technique for silent evaluation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate."
