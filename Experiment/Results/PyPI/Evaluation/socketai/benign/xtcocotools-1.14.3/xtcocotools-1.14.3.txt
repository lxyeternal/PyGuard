      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of 'version.py'. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is modest (around 0.2) due to the 'exec' pattern, which is common but slightly risky if the version file is compromised."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for mask processing functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (0.1) are appropriate, considering the external extension dependency. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use in production environments, assuming the external extension is sourced from a trusted provider."

The minor output suppression is a benign technique for silent evaluation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate."
