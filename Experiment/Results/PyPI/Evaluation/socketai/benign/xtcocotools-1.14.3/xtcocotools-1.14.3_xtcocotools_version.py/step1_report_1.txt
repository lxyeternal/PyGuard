  "purpose": "Define version information for the package or module.",
  "sources": "None, the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, there are no untrusted data sinks or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs. It only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the variable __version__ to '1.14.3' and assigns this value to short_version. It appears to be standard version declaration, common in Python packages to specify version info. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors. No data input, output, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
