  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data assignment.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static string to __version__, then copying to short_version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a fixed version string to __version__ and then assigns that value to short_version. There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
