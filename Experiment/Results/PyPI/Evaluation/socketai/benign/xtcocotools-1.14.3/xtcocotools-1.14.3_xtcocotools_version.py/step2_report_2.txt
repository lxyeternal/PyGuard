  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of version strings to variables (`__version__` and `short_version`). There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static assignment with no external interactions, dynamic code, or obfuscation, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified and should remain.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | 0            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            |\n| Security Risk     | 0            |\n\nThis code is entirely benign and poses no security threat.",
