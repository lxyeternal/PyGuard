  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code simply assigns a static string `'1.14.3'` to `__version__` and then assigns that value to `short_version`. This is a very common pattern for defining package version info in Python modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward variable assignment with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and without malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1, which seem appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or obfuscated behavior.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   All reports assign `obfuscated` = 0, which is correct. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**  \n   All reports assign `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Are any scores unreasonable?**  \n   No. The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n   No. The code is static and simple, with no assumptions needed.\n\n6. **Are there any inconsistencies?**  \n   No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, the scores could even be lowered from 1 to 0 in some reports, but as they are already 0 or 1, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
