  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script; no malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows. Uses 'exec' on version.py, which is typical.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a note that 'exec' on 'version.py' could be a minor security concern if the file is malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that 'exec' could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised, but overall the code is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reflects the minor concern about executing external code.\n\n**Note:** The reasoning is cautious and justified. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing that no malicious code is present.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that dynamic version reading is typical, with minimal risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup, with emphasis on 'exec' on 'version.py' as a minor risk.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately points out that executing external code can be risky if the file is malicious, but in normal circumstances, it's acceptable.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher, acknowledging the potential risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports agree that no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.2–0.3, primarily due to the use of 'exec' on external files, which is a common but sometimes risky pattern if the files are compromised.\n\n### My Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — executing external files with 'exec' can be a security concern if the files are malicious, but in controlled package environments, this is standard practice.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is tampered with, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- If security is a priority, consider replacing 'exec' with safer alternatives, such as importing the version module directly or reading version info as a string.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears safe and standard for a setup script, with only a minor, typical concern regarding 'exec'.",
