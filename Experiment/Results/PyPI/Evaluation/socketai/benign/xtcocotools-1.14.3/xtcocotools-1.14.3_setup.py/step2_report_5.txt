  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script with no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows. It uses `exec` to load version info, which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malware, no obfuscation, security risk is zero. The confidence is high (1). The reasoning is sound, and no issues are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the `exec` on `version.py` as a minor security concern. No network activity or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.8) due to the `exec` concern, but overall the code appears standard. The security risk is noted as 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup process. No suspicious activity, but notes the use of `exec` as a minor concern.\n\n- **Assessment:** Confidence is high (0.9), and the overall conclusion aligns with previous reports. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlights the `exec` on `version.py` as a potential risk but considers the script typical for package setup.\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.7) due to the `exec` concern. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script with no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and typical dependency parsing and extension compilation.\n\n- **Assessment:** High confidence (0.9). No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware. The use of `exec` is noted as a potential risk but not malicious. No network activity, no code injection, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected across all reports.\n\n- **Risk Score:** While the use of `exec` on an external version file is a known pattern, it can be exploited if the file is maliciously altered. However, in typical controlled environments, this is standard practice. The risk score should reflect this minor concern but not elevate to a high threat level.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (to account for the `exec` concern but recognizing that it’s a common pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious)\n\n**Overall, the code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the execution of external code via `exec`, which should be mitigated by ensuring the integrity of the `version.py` file.**",
