  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of 'version.py'. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is modest (around 0.2) due to the 'exec' pattern, which is common but slightly risky if the version file is compromised."
