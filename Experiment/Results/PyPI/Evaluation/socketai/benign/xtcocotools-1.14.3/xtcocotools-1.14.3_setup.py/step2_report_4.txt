  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The setup script reads version info via `exec`, parses dependencies, and compiles extensions. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external network operations, no data exfiltration. The use of `exec` is typical for dynamic versioning, not inherently malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- **Assessment:** The report is reasonable. No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the `exec` call on `version.py` as a minor security concern.\n- **Findings:** The `exec` could be risky if `version.py` is malicious, but otherwise, the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Security risk is 0.2, malware is 0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The cautious note about `exec` is valid. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware.\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; dependency parsing and extension compilation are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.2, malware 0, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup with `exec` on version file, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The use of `exec` is a potential risk but common in such scripts.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.3, malware 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—no malicious behavior, standard setup procedures.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.2, malware 0, fitting.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware. The code is typical for a Python setup script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.2-0.3) mainly due to the use of `exec` on external files (`version.py`). This is a common pattern but could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard package setup tasks.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The use of `exec` on `version.py` is a known pattern but carries a minor security risk if the file is compromised.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** (due to `exec` on external file, which is a common but slightly risky pattern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe setup script is a standard, legitimate package configuration file with minimal security concerns primarily related to executing external code for versioning. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                  | 0.2        |\n\nThis reflects a low-risk, non-malicious setup script with a minor caveat regarding the execution of external code.",
