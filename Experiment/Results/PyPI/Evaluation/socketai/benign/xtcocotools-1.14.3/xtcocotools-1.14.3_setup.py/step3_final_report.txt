  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'xtcocotools' Python package, handling dependency parsing, version management, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'xtcocotools/version.py' via 'exec'; parses requirements from 'requirements.txt'; sources for extension compilation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes external code ('exec') on version.py; dependency parsing could process untrusted input if requirements.txt is compromised.",
  "flows": "exec reads 'version.py' -> executes code to set version variables; parse_requirements reads and processes dependencies; extension sources are compiled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to load version info from an external file, which could be risky if the file is maliciously altered; no obfuscation or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with dependency parsing, version extraction, and extension compilation. The use of 'exec' on 'version.py' is a common pattern but introduces a minor security risk if the file is compromised. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The dependency parsing is straightforward, and the extension build process is typical. The overall code appears legitimate and safe for deployment, with a minor concern regarding executing external code for versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of 'version.py'. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is modest (around 0.2) due to the 'exec' pattern, which is common but slightly risky if the version file is compromised.",
