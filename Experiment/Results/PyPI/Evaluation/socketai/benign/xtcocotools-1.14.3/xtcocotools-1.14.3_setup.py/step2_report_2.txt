  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows. The use of `exec` on the version file is typical in setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligns with standard package setup practices. No issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, but notes that the use of `exec` to load version info could be a minor security concern if the version file is maliciously altered.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The use of `exec` is a known pattern but can be risky if the version file is compromised. The report correctly identifies this as a minor concern but does not consider it malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the potential for malicious modification, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard setup script, with no malicious behavior. The use of `exec` is noted but considered acceptable in controlled environments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analysis. The minor security risk due to `exec` is acknowledged but not deemed malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup script, with a focus on the `exec` call on `version.py`. It notes that executing external code can be risky if the file is maliciously modified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score reflects awareness of the potential vulnerability, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate; the code is typical, with a minor security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious flows. The `exec` call is standard but noted as a potential risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the pattern as standard with a minor security consideration.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight concerns about the use of `exec` on external files, but no actual malicious activity. The scores range from 0.2 to 0.3, which seem appropriate given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with dependency parsing, version management, and extension compilation.\n- The use of `exec` to load version info is a common pattern but can be a security concern if the version file is compromised. However, in controlled build environments, this is standard practice.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The security risk scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Recommended Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (due to the use of `exec` on external files, which is a known minor vulnerability if the file is compromised)\n\n**Final justification:** The setup script is legitimate, with a minor security consideration regarding executing external code for versioning. No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Recommended Score |\n|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2–0.3           |\n\nThe overall assessment confirms the code is safe and standard, with only a minimal, acceptable security concern related to dynamic code execution in version management.",
