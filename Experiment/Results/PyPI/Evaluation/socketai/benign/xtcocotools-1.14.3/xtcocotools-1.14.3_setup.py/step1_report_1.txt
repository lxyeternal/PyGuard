{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the xtcocotools package, including dependency parsing, versioning, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.py' for version info, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading source files for compilation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems, and no network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flow paths detected. The code reads files for configuration and executes setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code present. The use of 'exec' on version file is typical for dynamic versioning, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads version info dynamically via 'exec', parses dependencies from a requirements file, and configures extension modules for compilation. All operations are typical for package setup scripts. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks were detected. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the 'xtcocotools' package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to common practices for packaging Python extensions and managing dependencies.",
