{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for manipulating masks stored in RLE format, including encoding, decoding, merging, and calculating metrics such as IOU and area, primarily for image segmentation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from the external '_mask' module, which likely contains core functionalities; no other data input sources observed in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Functions like encode, decode, area, toBbox, and merge process data within the RLE format; no untrusted external sinks or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input masks through encoding or decoding functions, with conversions between different representations; no external data flows or network communications are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; the code appears to be a standard API wrapper around '_mask' functions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an internal module '_mask' and provides wrapper functions for encoding, decoding, area calculation, and other operations. It handles both list and single RLE objects properly, with conditional logic to ensure correct processing. The code comments describe typical usage and the purpose of each function, consistent with standard image processing tasks. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors is present. The functions operate solely within local data structures, with no external communications or security-sensitive operations. The purpose appears to be straightforward image mask manipulation for a computer vision pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for mask processing operations using RLE format, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe utility module intended for image segmentation tasks.",
