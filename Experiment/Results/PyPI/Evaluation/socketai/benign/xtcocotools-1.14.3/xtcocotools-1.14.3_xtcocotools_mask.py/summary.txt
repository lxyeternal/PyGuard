  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for mask processing functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (0.1) are appropriate, considering the external extension dependency. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use in production environments, assuming the external extension is sourced from a trusted provider."
