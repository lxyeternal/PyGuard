  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the 'snuggs' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading '__version__' from 'snuggs/__init__.py'.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted input sinks; standard setup.py build process.",
  "flows": "Reading files (source) to set package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a README file for long description, extracting version info from a package init file, and calling setup() with package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used during this process. No suspicious or malicious code elements such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The dependencies are standard ('numpy', 'pyparsing'), with no indication of malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a typical, safe package build script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It performs routine package configuration tasks without any security risks.",
