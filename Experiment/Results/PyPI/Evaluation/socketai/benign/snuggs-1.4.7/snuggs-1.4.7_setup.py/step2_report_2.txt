  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code reads static files for metadata and passes this data to `setuptools.setup()`.\n- Dependencies are explicitly specified.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- The extraction of the version from `__init__.py` is straightforward and static.\n- The long description is read from a static README file.\n- No untrusted data sources or external commands are used.\n- The setup process is standard and safe.\n\n### Issues or anomalies:\n- The report's analysis is accurate; there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The only minor point is that the `version` extraction could be more robust (e.g., using regex), but this does not impact security.\n\n### Scoring:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or negligible, which is appropriate.\n- The only report that assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 is likely overestimating, given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided setup script is standard, straightforward, and free from security issues. All reports are correct in their assessment, and no adjustments are needed.",
