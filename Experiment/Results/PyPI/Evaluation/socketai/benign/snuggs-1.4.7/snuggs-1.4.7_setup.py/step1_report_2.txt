  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the 'snuggs' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading '__version__' from 'snuggs/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external commands or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting package metadata -> calling setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the long description from a README file and extracts version info from the package's __init__.py. The setup() function is called with static, predefined package metadata. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard setup script for building and distributing a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
