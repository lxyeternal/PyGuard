{
  "purpose": "Build configuration for the 'snuggs' Python package, including reading metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; reading '__version__' from 'snuggs/__init__.py'; user-specified static package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "Reading description and version info from files, then passing static metadata to setuptools for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script for packaging. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the package long description from a README file, extracts version information from the package's __init__.py, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or suspicious code structures are present. The dependencies are explicitly specified, and there is no indication of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
