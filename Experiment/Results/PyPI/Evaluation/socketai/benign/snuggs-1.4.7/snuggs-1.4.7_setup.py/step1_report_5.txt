{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build and package the 'snuggs' Python library, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description; reads __init__.py to extract version number.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; setup() parameters are static or derived from safe file reads.",
  "flows": "Reads README for long description; extracts version from __init__.py; passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward package setup code with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a static README file for description, extracts version information from __init__.py, and uses setuptools.setup() to package the project. No untrusted input handling, no network communication, and no code execution based on external data. The version extraction method is simple and static, with no evidence of malicious manipulation or obfuscation. The package metadata appears legitimate and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup tasks without any malicious behavior or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is negligible.",
