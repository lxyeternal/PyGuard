{
  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the 'snuggs' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst for long description; reading __init__.py for version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files (README.rst and __init__.py) to variables used in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for file handling and package setup. It reads the long description from a static README file and extracts the package version from a __init__.py file in a straightforward manner. The setup() function is used with typical parameters, including dependencies and metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no external data inputs that could be manipulated maliciously, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
