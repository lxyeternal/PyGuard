  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python setup script.\n- No report indicates dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input.\n- The code reads static files ('README.rst' and '__init__.py') and passes data to setuptools.setup().\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is still very low.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears benign. No issues are present.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The method of extracting the version from `__init__.py` could be fragile if the line isn't formatted exactly as expected, but this is a common pattern and not inherently insecure.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is consistent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- The securityRisk scores are all 0, except one report giving 0.1, which seems overly cautious but not unreasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only minor point is the version extraction method:\n  ```python\n  version = line.split(\"=\")[1]\n  version = version.strip().strip('\"')\n  ```\n  If the `__version__` line is formatted differently, this could cause a bug, but not a security risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed to scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, safe setup script.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis setup script is standard, straightforward, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The scores provided are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate, and the code is safe for use.",
