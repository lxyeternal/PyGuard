  "purpose": "Build configuration for the 'snuggs' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; reading '__version__' from 'snuggs/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "Passing data to setuptools.setup() for package installation; no untrusted data handling or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> extracting version -> passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; standard static file reads and setup invocation. Version extraction assumes specific formatting but is not insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files for package metadata, extracts version info from a line starting with '__version__', and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Dependencies are explicitly specified. The version extraction method could be fragile if the format differs, but this does not impact security. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious code are detected. The code is a typical setup script for packaging, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
