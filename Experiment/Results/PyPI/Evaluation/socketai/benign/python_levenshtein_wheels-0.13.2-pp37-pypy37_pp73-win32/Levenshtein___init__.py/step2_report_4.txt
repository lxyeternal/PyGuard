  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a straightforward import of a local module `_levenshtein`, with conditional handling if the import fails, and setting package metadata (`__version__`, `__author__`, and possibly `__doc__`).\n- None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be standard package setup code, commonly used in Python modules to handle optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code performs a conditional import of `_levenshtein`, sets `__doc__` if successful, and defines static metadata. No issues, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws in the reports' reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as standard, non-malicious, and safe.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling.\n\n**Are any score adjustments needed?**  \nNo. The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is necessary. The code does not perform any risky operations, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is purely for package setup, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made, which is correct.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and typical for Python package initialization.",
