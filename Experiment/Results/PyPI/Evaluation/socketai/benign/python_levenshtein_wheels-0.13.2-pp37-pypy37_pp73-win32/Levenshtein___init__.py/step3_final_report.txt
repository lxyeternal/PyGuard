  "purpose": "Optional import of the local _levenshtein module and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package; reading __doc__, __version__, __author__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows from local module to internal variables; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata setup with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard optional import of a local module, assigns __doc__ if successful, and defines static metadata. It handles ImportError gracefully. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is typical for package setup, with no external data handling or network activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
