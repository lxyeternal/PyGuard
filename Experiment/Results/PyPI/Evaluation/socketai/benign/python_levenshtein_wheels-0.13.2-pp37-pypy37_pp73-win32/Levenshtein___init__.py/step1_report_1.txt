  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a local module '_levenshtein' and its contents, setting documentation based on the module if import succeeds, and defines version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads local module '_levenshtein' and its attributes, which are internal or part of the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import process is straightforward: source is the import statement, no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional import logic, but no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code handles conditional importing of a module, sets documentation from the module if successful, and defines package metadata. There are no suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security risks present in this fragment. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical import and metadata setup snippet for a Python package. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
