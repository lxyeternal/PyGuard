  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Malware**  \n   All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward import and metadata setup pattern, with no suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious behavior detected. The code simply attempts to import a local module `_levenshtein`, handles import failure gracefully, and sets some static metadata variables.  \n   **My assessment:** There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   The code is standard for optional local module imports, with proper exception handling and metadata assignment. No logical flaws or errors are apparent.  \n   **My assessment:** The code is correct and idiomatic for its purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are consistent with the analysis and seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.  \n   **My suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since all reports and my own review find no malicious activity or security risks, there is no justification for higher risk scores.  \n   **My assessment:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \n   The code does not perform any dynamic data handling, network activity, or processing of untrusted inputs. It only handles module import logic.  \n   **My assessment:** No vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and with my evaluation.\n\n7. **Overall Final Assessment**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n   - **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a typical pattern for optional local module import and metadata setup, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
