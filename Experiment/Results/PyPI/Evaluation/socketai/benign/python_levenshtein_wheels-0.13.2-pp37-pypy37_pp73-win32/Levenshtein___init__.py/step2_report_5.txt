  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code attempts to import a local module `_levenshtein`.\n   - If the import succeeds, it assigns the module's docstring to the current module's `__doc__`.\n   - It defines static metadata variables `__version__` and `__author__`.\n   - If the import fails, `_levenshtein` is set to `None`.\n   - The code is wrapped in a typical try-except block, with straightforward exception handling.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, such as executing untrusted data, network calls, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n   - The import logic is standard for optional dependencies.\n   - The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only manages internal module imports and static metadata.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is sound; the code is simple and typical for package setup.\n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty based on the code snippet.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the risk scores.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern might be if `_levenshtein` is malicious, but given the code, the import is local and optional; there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The code itself doesn't execute or process untrusted input, so the risk remains minimal.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical import and metadata setup pattern.\n   - No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0, given the absence of security issues.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is standard, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
