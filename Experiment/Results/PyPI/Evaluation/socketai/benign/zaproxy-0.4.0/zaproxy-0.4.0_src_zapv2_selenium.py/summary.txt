  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API wrapper for Selenium configuration in ZAP, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to its configuration nature. Overall, the code is safe and intended for legitimate use in security testing automation."
