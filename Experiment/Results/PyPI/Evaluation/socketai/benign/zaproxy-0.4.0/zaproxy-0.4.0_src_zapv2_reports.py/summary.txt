  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper for ZAP reporting functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The primary security consideration is proper management of the API key and endpoint security, not the code itself. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the analysis."
