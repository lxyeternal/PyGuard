The security risk is minimal and mainly hinges on external configuration, such as secure API key management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this analysis and are appropriate."

The low security risk score is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent danger but acknowledging potential misuse if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its intended purpose."

The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to its configuration nature. Overall, the code is safe and intended for legitimate use in security testing automation."

The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external input validation, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with unvalidated user inputs in API calls."
