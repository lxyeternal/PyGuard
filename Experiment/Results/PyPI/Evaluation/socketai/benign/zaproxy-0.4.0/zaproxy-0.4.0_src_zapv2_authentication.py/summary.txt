  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper for ZAP's authentication management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external input validation, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with unvalidated user inputs in API calls."
