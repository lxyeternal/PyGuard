  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated API wrapper for ZAP alert filter management, free of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and mainly hinges on external configuration, such as secure API key management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this analysis and are appropriate."
