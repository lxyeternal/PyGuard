  "purpose": "API client wrapper for ZAP's GraphQL interface, enabling configuration retrieval and schema import via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "API request functions that read parameters and send HTTP requests to ZAP endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests transmitting data from parameters to external ZAP API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data from function parameters flows into API request payloads, which are sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated, straightforward API client that interacts with ZAP's GraphQL API. It performs standard get/set operations and schema imports without any obfuscation or malicious logic. The data flows are typical for such wrappers, and there are no signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is that untrusted inputs are passed into API requests, but this is standard for API wrappers and does not constitute malicious activity. The code's structure and purpose are clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, generated API client for ZAP's GraphQL features. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given the context of untrusted input handling in API requests.",
