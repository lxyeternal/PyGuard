  "purpose": "Implementation of affine and boundary mappings for simplicial mesh elements, providing geometric transformations and their derivatives.",
  "sources": "Mesh data attributes such as mesh.p (node coordinates), mesh.t (element connectivity), mesh.facets (boundary facets).",
  "sinks": "Transformation functions (F, invF, G, etc.) that process input coordinate arrays; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate arrays (X, x) flow into transformation functions, which use internal mesh data to compute transformed coordinates; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; standard numpy-based geometric computations; lazy evaluation patterns are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard finite element affine and boundary mappings, with lazy evaluation for matrices and determinants. It reads mesh data, performs geometric transformations, and computes derivatives and normals. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The functions operate solely on internal mesh data and input arrays, with no external communication or system calls. The use of numpy for matrix operations is standard and transparent. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of affine and boundary mappings for finite element meshes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The data handling and computations are typical for such applications, and no external threats are evident.",
