  "purpose": "The code implements a class for affine mappings associated with finite element meshes, providing transformations between local and global coordinates, as well as geometric computations related to mesh elements.",
  "sources": "Reads include mesh properties such as mesh.p, mesh.t, and mesh.facets, which provide node coordinates, element connectivity, and facet data.",
  "sinks": "Uses data for geometric transformations and matrix calculations, with no evidence of writing or transmitting untrusted data or secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources (mesh data) flow into matrix and vector computations for mapping matrices, determinants, inverses, and geometric properties; outputs are transformation results, determinants, and normals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard finite element mesh computations. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns observed. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation code present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically computes affine and boundary mappings, their determinants, inverses, and geometric properties such as normals. It employs standard numpy operations and finite element concepts. No dynamic code execution, external data transmission, or suspicious behaviors identified. The lazy evaluation pattern for matrix computations is typical in numerical code for efficiency. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of finite element affine mappings without any signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The purpose is clear, and there are no anomalies suggesting security risks.",
