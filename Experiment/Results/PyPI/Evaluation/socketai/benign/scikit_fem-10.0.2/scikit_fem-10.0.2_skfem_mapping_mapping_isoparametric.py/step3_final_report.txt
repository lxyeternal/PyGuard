  "purpose": "A finite element mesh mapping class implementing isoparametric transformations, Jacobian calculations, and normals for 2D/3D meshes.",
  "sources": "Mesh data (doflocs, facets, edge_dofs, facet_dofs), basis functions (lbasis), input arrays (X, tind, find).",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions computing mappings, Jacobians, and normals; no external communication or file/network I/O.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input data (X, tind, find) flow through basis evaluations and matrix operations within local computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard finite element geometric transformations, including mapping, Jacobian, inverse Jacobian, and normals. It uses caching for efficiency and handles potential numerical issues with exceptions. No malicious patterns or external communications are present. The processing of untrusted data is typical for FEM routines and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard FEM utility class for mesh transformations. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity. The processing of untrusted input is expected and safe within this context.",
