{
  "purpose": "Defines reference finite element domains for use in finite element analysis or mesh generation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions and static data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions representing geometric reference domains, with static data arrays defining points, facets, normals, and connectivity. The methods are straightforward, mostly returning static or derived data. No input handling, no network operations, no code execution based on external data, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be well-structured for geometric modeling without any hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of geometric reference domain definitions for finite element methods. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on the provided content.",
