{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for various finite element reference domains used in mesh generation or finite element analysis.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, methods like init_refdom and on_facet, and numpy array assignments for coordinates, facets, and normals.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could be exploited to leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly within class attributes and method calls; no flow from external untrusted input to sensitive operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. All code appears to be straightforward data definitions and class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for geometric reference domains with associated mesh data such as points, facets, and normals. Methods are simple class methods that return class data or perform basic assertions. No external input handling, no network communication, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's purpose appears to be mathematical or geometrical data representation for finite element methods. There are no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously crafted code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as data containers for finite element reference geometries. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It is a standard data definition module with no hidden or harmful intent.",
