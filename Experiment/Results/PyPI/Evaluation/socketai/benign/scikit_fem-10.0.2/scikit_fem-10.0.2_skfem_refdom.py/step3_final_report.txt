  "purpose": "Defines static classes representing geometric reference domains for finite element analysis, providing points, facets, normals, and boundary checks.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes with numpy arrays for points, facets, normals, and boundary condition methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static data used for geometric definitions, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no external data handling, only geometric data and boundary checks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with static numpy arrays representing points, facets, edges, and normals for various geometric reference elements. Methods like 'on_facet' perform boundary checks based on coordinate constraints. There are no external inputs, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The data appears consistent with standard finite element geometric references. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is purely data definitions with straightforward boundary functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static geometric data module for finite element reference domains. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The scores are appropriately zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk metrics.",
