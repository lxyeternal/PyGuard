  "purpose": "Define utility functions and a custom ndarray subclass for handling oriented boundary data, with a deprecated warning mechanism.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to hash_args, ndarray data in OrientedBoundary, and arguments to functions decorated with @deprecated.",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions and warning messages; no data leaks or external effects are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data from input arguments to hashing or warning functions; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a hash function supporting numpy arrays, a subclass of ndarray with an additional attribute, and a deprecation decorator that issues warnings. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The hashing of numpy arrays is a common practice for cache keys or data integrity checks. The warning decorator correctly issues deprecation warnings. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving utility functions for data handling and deprecation warnings. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
