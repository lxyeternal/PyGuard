{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for hashing, a subclass for oriented boundary arrays, and a decorator for deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; the code defines functions and classes, with no input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data for malicious effects; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic. The classes and functions serve typical utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hashing function for numpy arrays, a subclass for arrays with additional orientation data, and a deprecation decorator that issues warnings. All components are standard utility patterns with no evidence of malicious intent. The hash_args function supports numpy arrays without executing external code. The OrientedBoundary class extends numpy.ndarray safely, adding an attribute, and the deprecated decorator issues warnings for deprecated functions. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe based on the current analysis.",
