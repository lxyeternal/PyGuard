  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing arguments supporting numpy arrays, a subclass of ndarray with an orientation attribute, and a decorator for issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Hashing function uses argument inputs; subclass accesses array data; decorator reads function name and issues warnings.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications; purely internal processing.",
  "flows": "Arguments are hashed; numpy array data is accessed for hashing; warnings are issued during function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard utility functions: hashing numpy arrays via tobytes(), subclassing ndarray with an extra attribute, and a deprecation warning decorator. All patterns are common and safe. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The hashing method is standard for numpy arrays, and the subclass correctly manages additional attributes. The warning decorator functions as intended. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation.",
