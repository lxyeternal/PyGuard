{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling numpy arrays, hashing arguments, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments such as numpy arrays, lists, or other hashable objects. The __new__ method and the deprecated decorator read data from parameters and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present. No functions write to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Arguments are hashed directly in hash_args; deprecated warnings are issued via warnings.warn, which could be seen as a notification but not a security sink.",
  "anomalies": "The class OrientedBoundary extends numpy.ndarray, which is unusual but not suspicious; no obfuscation or hidden behavior detected. The deprecated decorator is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hash function supporting numpy arrays, a subclass of ndarray with an extra attribute 'ori', and a decorator for issuing deprecation warnings. All parts are standard and do not exhibit malicious patterns. No external data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious behavior is observed. The code uses common patterns with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility code for handling numpy arrays and issuing warnings about deprecated functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
