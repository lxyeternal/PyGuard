{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for hashing numpy arrays, a subclass for handling oriented boundary arrays, and a decorator for deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include arguments passed to hash_args() and potentially objects passed to OrientedBoundary during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments in hash_args() or class instantiation in OrientedBoundary through internal processing, but no untrusted data is directed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard library features and numpy in typical ways; no unusual or suspicious code constructs are detected. The deprecation decorator simply issues warnings without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The hash_args() function hashes numpy arrays by converting them to bytes, which is a standard and safe operation. The OrientedBoundary class subclasses numpy.ndarray, adding an 'ori' attribute, with no hidden or malicious code. The deprecated() decorator issues deprecation warnings for functions, with no malicious side effects. There are no network, file, or system modifications, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be utility code for mathematical and API management purposes, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility implementation for hashing, numpy array subclassing, and deprecation warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this fragment.",
