  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions and a custom ndarray subclass for orientation data, plus deprecation warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: Only internal data handling; no external data leaks or malicious effects.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: The code is benign, with common patterns. Hashing numpy arrays and issuing warnings are typical practices.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions and classes for array handling, hashing, and warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: No external data or system effects.\n- Anomalies: None; standard utility code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Safe, typical utility code; no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Hashing, ndarray subclass, deprecation warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: No external malicious effects.\n- Anomalies: None; standard patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for numpy arrays, subclass, warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: No external communication or malicious effects.\n- Anomalies: None; standard code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious intent detected.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Hashing, ndarray subclass, deprecation warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: No external malicious effects.\n- Anomalies: None; typical utility code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Benign, standard patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior. The malware score should remain at **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Obfuscated should stay at **0.0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of external effects, data exfiltration, or malicious intent, the overall security risk remains very low, at **0.0**.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code's hashing functions are safe, leveraging numpy's tobytes() method, which is standard.\n- The ndarray subclass correctly manages additional attributes without security issues.\n- The deprecation decorator issues warnings but does not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with benign utility code. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns.",
