  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for array handling, hashing, and deprecation warnings in scientific computing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments (hash_args), array objects (ndarray), and class attributes (ori).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted input into system effects or data leaks; warnings are only issued locally.",
  "flows": "hash_args processes input arguments; deprecated decorator issues warnings; __new__ and __array_finalize__ handle array creation and attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Use of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and a subclass of numpy.ndarray with an additional attribute. hash_args provides a safe hashing method for numpy arrays and other types. OrientedBoundary extends ndarray to include orientation data, with proper handling of array creation and finalization. The deprecated decorator issues warnings about deprecated functions. No external data is read that could be malicious, and no external communication or system modification code is present. The code appears standard and benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It mainly provides safe array handling and deprecation warnings. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
