  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could be improved for clarity and security. The empty reports do not provide any evidence to suggest otherwise. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low (~0.1)."
