{
  "purpose": "The code consolidates multiple submodule exports from the skfem package into a single __all__ list for easier access and management.",
  "sources": "Wildcard imports from skfem.mesh, skfem.assembly, skfem.mapping, skfem.element, and skfem.utils modules; reading __all__ attributes from submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Imported modules' __all__ attributes are combined into the main __all__ list, with specific functions and variables included.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports which can lead to namespace pollution; presence of deprecated items marked for removal; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module aggregation using wildcard imports and explicit __all__ management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The reports are empty, providing no additional evidence or concerns. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but not inherently malicious. The deprecated items indicate ongoing maintenance. Overall, the code appears benign with minimal security concern, primarily related to coding style.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could be improved for clarity and security. The empty reports do not provide any evidence to suggest otherwise. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low (~0.1).",
