{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'scikit-fem' package using different import methods depending on Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Attempted imports of 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata' and the calls to 'metadata.version' or 'metadata_legacy.version' with the package name 'scikit-fem'.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns version strings to '__version__', which could be used later in the program; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and exception handling lead to calling 'metadata.version' or 'metadata_legacy.version' with a fixed package name; output stored in '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks to handle import errors is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version compatibility and imports the appropriate module to fetch package metadata. It gracefully handles missing modules and exceptions, defaulting to 'unknown' when necessary. The package name is hardcoded as 'scikit-fem'. There are no dynamic inputs, no network calls, or suspicious operations. The logic is straightforward and standard for version detection. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to determine the version of a specific package, implementing compatibility across different Python versions. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are present. The code is standard and safe.",
