  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code's purpose and behavior:**\n- The code attempts to import `importlib.metadata` (Python 3.8+) or falls back to `importlib_metadata` (legacy).\n- It sets a `legacy` flag based on import success.\n- It then retrieves the version of the `'scikit-fem'` package via `metadata.version()` or `metadata_legacy.version()`.\n- If any exception occurs, it defaults `__version__` to `\"unknown\"`.\n\n**Security and malicious activity assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, standard for package version detection.\n- No user input, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- The purpose is environment introspection, not exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues detected.** The code performs a standard, safe operation.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The code correctly handles missing modules and exceptions.\n- The use of `__version__` as a global variable is typical.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- The consistent use of exception handling and standard library functions aligns with best practices.\n- No report suggests any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility snippet for retrieving package version information, with no security concerns or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** All reports are accurate and consistent with my analysis. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and security posture.",
