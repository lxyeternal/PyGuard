{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'scikit-fem' package using importlib.metadata or its legacy fallback.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata via importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata depending on the Python version.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data or sensitive information; it only assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "flows": "The version string obtained from package metadata flows into the __version__ variable, but is not used further in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code gracefully handles missing modules and exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version compatibility to import package metadata modules. It assigns the package version to __version__ by querying the package metadata. Exception handling ensures fallback to 'unknown'. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code present. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on package metadata retrieval without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe method for obtaining package version information. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility snippet for version detection.",
