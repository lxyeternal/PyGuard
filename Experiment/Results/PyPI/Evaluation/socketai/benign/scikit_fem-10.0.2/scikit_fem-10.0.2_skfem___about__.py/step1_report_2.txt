  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'scikit-fem' package using importlib.metadata or its legacy alternative.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'scikit-fem' package metadata via importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or insecure operations; primarily reads package metadata",
  "flows": "The code reads package version info from the environment via package metadata functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code checks for Python version compatibility, importing the appropriate metadata module. It then attempts to retrieve the version of the 'scikit-fem' package, defaulting to 'unknown' if any errors occur. The logic is straightforward and focused on package metadata retrieval without any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign method for retrieving package version information with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
