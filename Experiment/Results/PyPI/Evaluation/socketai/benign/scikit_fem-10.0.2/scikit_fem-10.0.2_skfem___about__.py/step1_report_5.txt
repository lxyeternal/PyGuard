{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'scikit-fem' package in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata to get the version of 'scikit-fem'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; the code only reads package info.",
  "flows": "The code flows from trying to import metadata handling modules, then retrieves the version info based on the environment, and assigns it to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and intended for environment introspection.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the package version of 'scikit-fem' using importlib.metadata for Python 3.8+ or importlib_metadata for earlier versions. It includes fallback error handling, setting __version__ to 'unknown' if import or version retrieval fails. No suspicious or malicious activities are present; it solely performs environment introspection without external communication or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for version detection, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
