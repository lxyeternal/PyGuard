  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is designed to retrieve the version of the 'scikit-fem' package using standard Python package metadata modules.\n- The code includes compatibility handling for different Python versions and exception handling to default to \"unknown\" if retrieval fails.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is detected in the code.\n- The purpose is environment introspection, with no external network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded credentials.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: it retrieves package version info using standard methods, with proper exception handling. No issues or malicious activity are evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or security flaws?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, robust, and standard for such a task.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct. The code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct. No security risks are apparent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 because the code performs a benign, well-understood task with no side effects or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives. The code is a typical pattern for package version retrieval.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe utility snippet for retrieving package version information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns.",
