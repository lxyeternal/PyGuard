{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'importlib.metadata' module (Python 3.8+) or falls back to 'importlib_metadata' for earlier versions, then retrieves the version of the 'scikit-fem' package, assigning it to '__version__'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata', and the calls to 'metadata.version' or 'metadata_legacy.version' for 'scikit-fem'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to '__version__' variable; no other sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import success leads to calling 'metadata.version' or 'metadata_legacy.version' to set '__version__'. Exceptions lead to setting '__version__' to 'unknown'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Slight potential for a NameError if both imports fail, but exception handling covers this scenario.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is benign: environment introspection for package version detection. It handles import errors and exceptions properly, defaults to 'unknown' if retrieval fails, and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious payloads. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The exception handling ensures robustness, and the logic aligns with standard practices. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The potential minor flaw is the assumption that if both imports fail, 'metadata_legacy' may be undefined, but the exception handling prevents issues. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retrieving package version information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
