{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine the version of the 'scikit-fem' package using different import methods depending on the Python version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version information from the package metadata, specifically through importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "The source is the package metadata functions (metadata.version or metadata_legacy.version) used to retrieve the package version information.",
  "anomalies": "The code has a try-except structure to handle multiple import scenarios but does not contain suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version compatibility to import the appropriate package metadata module. It attempts to retrieve the version of 'scikit-fem' with fallbacks for compatibility, and assigns 'unknown' if retrieval fails. There are no external inputs, user data, or network interactions. The code appears standard and intended solely for version detection without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward, benign task of retrieving package version information with compatibility handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
