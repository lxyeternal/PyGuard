  "purpose": "Mathematical utility functions for derivatives, tensor operations, and matrix algebra used in finite element analysis.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed into functions such as DiscreteField attributes (grad, div, curl, hess, grad3, grad4) and numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O; functions operate solely on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (DiscreteField attributes or arrays) flows through mathematical functions, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard mathematical operations for tensor calculus, derivatives, and matrix algebra, with no external interactions or malicious patterns. It uses well-known numpy functions and operates on passed-in data structures. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and serve scientific computation purposes. No external data handling, network activity, or side effects are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility library for scientific tensor and matrix operations, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety for supply chain distribution.",
