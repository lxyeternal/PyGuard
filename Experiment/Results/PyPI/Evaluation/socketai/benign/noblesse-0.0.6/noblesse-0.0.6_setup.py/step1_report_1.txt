  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'noblesse' Python module/package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.md'; static configuration data for package setup (name, version, description, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks involving untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' as input, then passing static metadata and dependencies to setuptools.setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and supplies package metadata and dependencies. All code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. No data leaks or malicious activity are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
