{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'noblesse' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, defining package configuration, listing dependencies, and metadata fields such as URL, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "None observed that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious or unsafe behavior. The code primarily performs setup configuration without dynamic or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The 'package_dir' points to 'src', but no suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README.md file for a long description, specifies package modules, dependencies, classifiers, and metadata. All operations are typical for package distribution. No code injection, malicious behavior, or anomalous constructs are present. The setup script does not include any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted inputs. It is a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use.",
