  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata fields; dependency list 'requests'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' into 'long_description'; static data assignment to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration; no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It reads a local README file and supplies static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are justified given the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
