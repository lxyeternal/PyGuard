{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'noblesse', including reading a README file for long description and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to obtain the long description and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data is processed in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: reading a local file ('README.md') and passing static package metadata into the setup() function; no untrusted input processing or data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code behavior are present. The code appears to be standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic evaluations, no external inputs beyond reading a local file, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The dependencies are standard ('requests') and the metadata fields contain benign values.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without processing untrusted data or executing suspicious operations.",
