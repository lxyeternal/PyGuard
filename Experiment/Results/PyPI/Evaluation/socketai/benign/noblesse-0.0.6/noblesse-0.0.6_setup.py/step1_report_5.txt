  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'noblesse' Python module, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data output or external communication within this script.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content flows into the setup configuration; no other data flows or execution paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading a markdown file and calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters. All data sources are local files, and dependencies are explicitly listed. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. Usage of open-source libraries is normal. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves its purpose of packaging a Python module securely.",
