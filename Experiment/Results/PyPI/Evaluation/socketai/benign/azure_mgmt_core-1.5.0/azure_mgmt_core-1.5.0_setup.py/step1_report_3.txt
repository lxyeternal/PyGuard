  "purpose": "Setup script for the azure-mgmt-core Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, reads package configuration and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted external data; all data sources are static files within the package or configuration files.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> uses regex to extract version -> reads markdown files for descriptions -> passes metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code strictly manages package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines package parameters, reads version info from a local file using regex, reads markdown files for description content, and calls setup() with package metadata. No external data inputs are processed at runtime. The version extraction relies on reading a specific file, and the approach is standard for Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, does not process untrusted input, and performs expected package configuration tasks.",
