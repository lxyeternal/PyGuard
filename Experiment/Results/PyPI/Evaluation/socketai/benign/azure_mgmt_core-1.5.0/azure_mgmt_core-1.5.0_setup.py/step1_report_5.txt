  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the azure-mgmt-core Python library, including version extraction and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from _version.py, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and gathers dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None observed that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Version info is extracted from a file within the package; metadata files are read and used to configure setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The script follows standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, dynamically reads version info from a local file, and reads documentation files. The setup() function configures the package with this info and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or code execution beyond file reading is present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
