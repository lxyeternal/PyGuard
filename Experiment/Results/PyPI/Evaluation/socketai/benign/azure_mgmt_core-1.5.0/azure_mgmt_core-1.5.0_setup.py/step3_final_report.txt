{
  "purpose": "This script is a standard Python package setup script that reads version information from a local '_version.py' file, loads README and CHANGELOG documentation, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py' via regex, loads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data is processed; static data is passed to setup().",
  "flows": "Reads local files for version and documentation, then supplies static data to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or patterns; the only potential minor issue is that if '_version.py' lacks a 'VERSION' variable, a RuntimeError is raised, which is standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, performing static file reads and invoking setuptools.setup() with predefined metadata. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The regex extraction of version info is safe, and the overall structure is typical for package distribution. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script, reflecting minimal inherent risk in package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and confidence levels in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
