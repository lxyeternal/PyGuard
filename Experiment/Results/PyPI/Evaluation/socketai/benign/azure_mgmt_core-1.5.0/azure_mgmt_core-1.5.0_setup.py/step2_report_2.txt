  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a standard setup script.\n- Sources: Reads version from _version.py, no external data.\n- Sinks/Flows: No external data flow or execution.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies this as a typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a standard package setup script with no security issues. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 (low, just a package setup).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation files.\n- Sinks/Flows: No external or untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes the code performs standard package setup.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the malware score remains 0. Obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar package setup.\n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation.\n- Sinks/Flows: Static data, no external data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correctly states this is standard packaging code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads version, documentation.\n- Sinks/Flows: No external data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard setup script.\n- Conclusion: No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard package configuration.\n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation, dependencies.\n- Sinks/Flows: No external data or code execution.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Accurately describes the code as a typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign Python package setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external data handling that could lead to security risks.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the nature of package setup scripts, but generally safe)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, with no signs of security issues or malicious intent.",
