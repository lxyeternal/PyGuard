{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package for distribution, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a local file (_version.py), reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows directly lead to untrusted data execution or external system effects; mainly file reads and package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from a file, combines README and changelog for description, then supplies this data to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. All file paths and data are static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It securely reads version info from a local file, reads documentation files, and calls setup() with static and derived metadata. No external data is fetched or executed, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
