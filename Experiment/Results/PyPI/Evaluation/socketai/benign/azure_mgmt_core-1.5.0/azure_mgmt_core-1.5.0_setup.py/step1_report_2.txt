{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'azure-mgmt-core'.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py', reads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files, and imports data from 'setuptools' and 're'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup()' function from 'setuptools' to package the library with the specified metadata; no untrusted data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file -> reads README and CHANGELOG files -> passes collected data into setup() -> packages the library.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: it reads version info via regex from a local file, loads markdown documentation files, and invokes setup() with metadata and dependencies. All operations are static, local, and conventional for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration. The use of 're' for regex matching is safe in this context. No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads local files and configures package distribution without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
