{
  "purpose": "The code implements mock testing and polling logic for Azure SDK long-running operations (LROs), simulating responses and resource deserialization within a controlled test environment.",
  "sources": "Mock responses generated within test fixtures, including response bodies, headers, and request URLs.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization routines converting JSON response bodies into resource objects; no external data flows or untrusted input handling beyond test mocks.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from mock responses into deserialization functions and resource object creation; no external or network data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of 'pickle' and 'base64' is confined to test serialization/deserialization, not malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for Azure SDK's long-running operation handling, employing mocks, deserialization, and polling mechanisms. It contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of standard libraries and testing patterns indicates a benign purpose. The minimal security risk score reflects the controlled testing environment, with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard testing framework for Azure SDK LROs, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The low risk score is appropriate given its testing scope.",
