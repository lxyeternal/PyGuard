{
  "purpose": "This code provides pytest configuration, fixture setup for testing, and file handling to load user credentials from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'credentials.json' file from the current directory to extract user credentials.",
  "sinks": "The user credentials are stored in variables, but no sensitive data is transmitted externally or written to logs; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source reading occurs when the 'user_password' fixture is invoked, loading data from the JSON file into variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; no suspicious or unusual code constructs detected. Usage of standard libraries and well-known testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages pytest test configurations and loads credentials from a local JSON file. The credential loading occurs only if the file exists; otherwise, an exception is raised. No external network calls, no credential exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, nor obfuscation. The JSON file path is derived from the current directory. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard testing utility setup that loads credentials from a local file for testing purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The use of credentials is limited to local testing context only.",
