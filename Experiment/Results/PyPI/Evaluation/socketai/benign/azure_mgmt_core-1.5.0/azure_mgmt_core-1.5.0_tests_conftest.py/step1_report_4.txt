{
  "purpose": "Provide pytest configuration and a fixture to load user credentials from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "os.path, sys, open(file), json.load(fd)",
  "sinks": "open(file) reads potentially external credentials; json.load(fd) processes input data",
  "flows": "credentials.json read -> json.load -> extraction of 'user' and 'password'",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; uses standard library functions as intended",
  "analysis": "The code sets up pytest options and a fixture to load credentials from a file named credentials.json located in the same directory. It checks for the existence of the file, reads its contents, and extracts user and password data. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network communication are present. The code relies on local file system access and standard JSON parsing, which are typical and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard testing utility setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads user credentials from a local file and does not perform any harmful or suspicious actions.",
