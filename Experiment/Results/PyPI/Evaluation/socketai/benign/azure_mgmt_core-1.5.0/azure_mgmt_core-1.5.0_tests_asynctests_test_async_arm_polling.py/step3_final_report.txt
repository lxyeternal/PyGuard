{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests and mock implementations for Azure SDK's async long-running operation polling, deserialization, and request handling. It uses controlled mock responses to simulate server replies for testing SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "Mock responses generated within the test functions, including response bodies and headers, used as input for deserialization and polling logic.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization functions (`json.loads`) and response handling within the test environment; no external untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Mock response data flows into deserialization and assertion steps, with no external data influencing the flow outside the controlled test setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of `pickle` is limited to error handling, which is safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions with mock responses simulating Azure SDK polling scenarios. All data is internally generated, and no external input or network activity is involved. The use of `json.loads()` and `pickle` is confined to controlled test cases. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for Azure SDK's polling mechanisms. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified given the controlled testing context.",
