  "purpose": "This code tests the retrieval of Azure cloud endpoint configurations for different Azure cloud settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AzureClouds attributes and the get_arm_endpoints function, which likely accesses external or configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions check the returned endpoint URLs and credential scopes, but do not involve untrusted data manipulation or external output.",
  "flows": "Input: AzureClouds settings -> get_arm_endpoints function -> returned cloud metadata -> assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard SDK functions and assertions for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from Azure SDK, uses predefined AzureClouds enum/settings, and calls get_arm_endpoints to retrieve endpoint metadata for different Azure cloud environments. It then asserts expected URLs and credential scope values. No user input, no external data manipulation, no hidden or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard test function verifying known configurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test verifying Azure cloud endpoint configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The assertions are for expected values; no evidence of malware or security issues.",
