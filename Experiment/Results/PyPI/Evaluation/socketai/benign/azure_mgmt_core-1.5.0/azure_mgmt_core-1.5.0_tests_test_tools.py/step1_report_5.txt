{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing, validating, and generating Azure resource IDs, and includes unit tests to verify their correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string resource IDs in the test cases, and imports functions from the azure.mgmt.core.tools package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted external input or output untrusted data; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The test cases generate resource IDs using resource_id() and parse them with parse_resource_id(), then compare results for validation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses standard library functions, and test cases are static. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite validating resource ID parsing and generation functions from a reputable library. The functions are tested with multiple static resource ID examples to ensure correct parsing and validation. The resource ID functions themselves are utility functions for Azure resource management; they do not include any malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. No external data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is well-structured, and the test cases are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe and standard utility test suite for Azure resource ID handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The functions tested are purely for validation and parsing of resource IDs, with no suspicious activity detected.",
