{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and classes for testing and handling ARM (Azure Resource Manager) exceptions, including mocking responses and parsing error messages.",
  "sources": "json.dumps() function to encode JSON data, _build_response() function creating mock HTTP responses, response handling within test_arm_exception()",
  "sinks": "Error message processing and exception raising in ARMError, string conversions, and assertions on error details",
  "flows": "json.dumps() output → _build_response() response body → ARMError response parsing → error object attributes and string representations",
  "anomalies": "None evident; code appears to be for testing and error handling, with no suspicious data, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of functools.partial and the handling of exception data are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, defines a response builder class, and creates test cases for ARMError exceptions, including various structured error messages. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform network activity, file modifications, or hidden operations. The handling of error data is straightforward, focusing on testing error structures. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are observed. All operations relate to mock responses and exception validation, typical for testing error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for Azure SDK error handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be used for validating error parsing logic without any malicious intent.",
