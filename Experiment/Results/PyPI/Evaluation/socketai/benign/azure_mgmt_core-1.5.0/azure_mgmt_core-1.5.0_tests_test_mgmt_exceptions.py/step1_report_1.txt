{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to simulate and test the handling of ARM (Azure Resource Manager) errors by creating mock responses and raising exceptions with detailed error information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from JSON-encoded error messages and responses generated within the _build_response() function.",
  "sinks": "The code raises custom exceptions (ARMError) based on the constructed mock responses; no external data sinks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "The code constructs error message JSON, encodes it, builds mock response objects, and then raises exceptions that parse this data, creating source-to-sink flows within exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code primarily deals with error message simulation and exception handling. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to build mock HTTP responses containing JSON error data. It then raises ARMError exceptions with these responses, which internally parse the JSON to expose detailed error info. Multiple test cases simulate various error scenarios, including malformed JSON, nested details, and specific Azure error codes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as a testing or mocking utility for error handling in Azure SDKs. All operations are limited to in-memory processing and exception raising based on static data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test utility designed to simulate Azure error responses for testing exception handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate testing error parsing logic. No security concerns are evident.",
