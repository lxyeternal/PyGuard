{
  "purpose": "The code creates mock HTTP responses with JSON error payloads and raises custom exceptions to simulate Azure Resource Manager error handling for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Static JSON error strings embedded in the _build_response function, and the response object passed to ARMError.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code operates entirely in-memory for testing error parsing.",
  "flows": "JSON payloads are encoded and passed to _build_response, which constructs mock response objects; these are used to instantiate ARMError, which parses the response.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with static data and no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a testing utility that constructs mock HTTP responses containing JSON error messages, then raises ARMError exceptions that parse these responses to expose detailed error information. It uses static, hardcoded JSON data, operates solely in-memory, and includes assertions to verify error parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is clearly for testing error handling in SDK development. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The exception handling and JSON structures are standard and safe. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, testing nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility designed to simulate Azure error responses for validation purposes. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safe and non-malicious intent.",
