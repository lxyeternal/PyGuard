{
  "purpose": "The code provides a plugin for pytest to support parallel test execution by sharding tests across multiple machines.",
  "sources": "Reads test item identifiers (`item.nodeid`) for hashing and shard assignment, and configuration options (`shard_id`, `num_shards`).",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not perform data leakage or dangerous operations; it only filters test items based on hashes.",
  "flows": "Test item IDs are hashed using sha256, then modded by total shards to determine shard membership; data flows from input (`items`) through hashing and filtering to produce a subset of tests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The script adds pytest options for sharding, hashes test identifiers to evenly distribute tests across shards, and filters test items accordingly. It performs safe operations—hashing test IDs, filtering based on shard ID, and raising errors if configuration is invalid. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for sharding tests in pytest. It contains no malware or malicious behaviors. It correctly uses hashing for distribution without unsafe operations. Overall security risk is very low.",
