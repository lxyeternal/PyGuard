  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a version string; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing its purpose and a version string. No input/output, data processing, or suspicious logic is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module fragment with no evidence of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
