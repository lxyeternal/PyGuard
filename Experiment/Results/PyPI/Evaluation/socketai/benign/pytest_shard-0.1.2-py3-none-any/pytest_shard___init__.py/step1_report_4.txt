  "purpose": "Metadata declaration indicating the version of the module and a comment about test sharding for parallel execution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code contains only a comment and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment and a version variable; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of a descriptive comment and a version string assignment. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no potentially malicious code segments. The comment suggests testing support for parallel execution, which is typical in software development. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the snippet is benign and standard for open-source modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a harmless metadata and comment statement with no malicious or security concerns.",
