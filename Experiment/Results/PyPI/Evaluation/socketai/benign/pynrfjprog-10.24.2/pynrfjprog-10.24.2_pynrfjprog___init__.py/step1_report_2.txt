{
  "purpose": "The code sets executable permissions on specific worker binaries based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "Reads from the current script's directory using Path(__file__).parent, and retrieves OS info using platform.system().",
  "sinks": "Modifies file permissions via Path.chmod() which affects binary files in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "OS detection -> glob pattern to find worker binaries -> check and modify file mode to add execute permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code only modifies file permissions for specific binaries based on OS detection.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the OS type and then locates specific worker binaries within directories matching 'lib_*/'. It attempts to ensure these binaries are executable by setting the execute permission bits if not already set. The process involves checking current permissions and modifying them accordingly, with error handling to raise exceptions if permissions cannot be set. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The operations are standard for ensuring executable files are properly permissioned. No external network or suspicious data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely manages executable permissions for specific binaries based on OS type. It performs standard filesystem operations without any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified.",
