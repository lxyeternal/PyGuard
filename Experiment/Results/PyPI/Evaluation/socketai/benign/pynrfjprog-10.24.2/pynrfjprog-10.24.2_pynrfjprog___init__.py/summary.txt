  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup utility for setting executable permissions on platform-specific binaries. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The existing malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Slightly lowering the risk score to 0.1 could reflect minimal risk associated with permission modifications, but overall, the code is safe."
