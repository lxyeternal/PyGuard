  "purpose": "This code attempts to import modules and issues a deprecation warning for the module itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements and warnings.warn.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only performs imports and a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block for imports to handle different module paths is standard, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import local modules using relative imports, falling back to absolute imports if an exception occurs, which suggests compatibility with different environments. It issues a deprecation warning for the module. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities are present. No hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, and no unsafe operations are detected. The structure is typical for a module supporting multiple import styles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily handling imports with fallback and issuing a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
