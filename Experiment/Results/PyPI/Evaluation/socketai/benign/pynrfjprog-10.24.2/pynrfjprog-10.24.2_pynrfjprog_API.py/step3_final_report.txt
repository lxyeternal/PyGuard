  "purpose": "The code attempts to import modules with fallback options and issues a deprecation warning, ensuring compatibility across different environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative and absolute paths, and the warnings.warn call.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import attempts from relative paths, fallback to absolute imports, then issuing a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except Exception' for import fallback, which could mask errors but is a common compatibility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports with fallback, accompanied by a deprecation warning. No data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The broad exception handling is notable but not malicious; it may obscure import errors but does not introduce security risks. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be considered even lower (0) given the benign nature. Overall, the code is a standard compatibility pattern with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing module imports with fallback and issuing a deprecation warning. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 for maximum accuracy.",
