  "purpose": "Import dependencies and warn users about deprecation of the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various modules and submodules, including conditional imports based on exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, import statements do not create data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling which may mask underlying import issues; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import several submodules from the current package, with a fallback to alternative import paths if exceptions occur. The exception handling is generic, catching any Exception, which might hide import errors but does not indicate malicious intent. A deprecation warning is issued for the module, advising users to switch to 'LowLevel.py'. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is typical for managing package compatibility and deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package management with deprecation warnings, containing no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
