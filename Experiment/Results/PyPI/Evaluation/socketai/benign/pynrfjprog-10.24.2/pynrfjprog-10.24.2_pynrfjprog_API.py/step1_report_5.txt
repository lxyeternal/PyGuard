{
  "purpose": "This code handles module imports with a fallback mechanism and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly the import of modules and exception handling that affects module loading.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; the only sink is the warning issued.",
  "flows": "Import attempts (try block) leading to fallback imports (except block), followed by issuing a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling that suppresses all exceptions during import, which may hide import errors or malicious modifications. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import internal modules with relative paths. If that fails, it falls back to absolute imports, possibly for compatibility reasons. It issues a deprecation warning advising users to use a different module. The exception handling is generic, catching all exceptions during import, which can obscure issues or malicious interference. The overall logic is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated code, malicious actions, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily manages imports and issues a warning about deprecation. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident from this snippet. The broad exception handling could mask underlying issues but does not indicate malicious intent.",
