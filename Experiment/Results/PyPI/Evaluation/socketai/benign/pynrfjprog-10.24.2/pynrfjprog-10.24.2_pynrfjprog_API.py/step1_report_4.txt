  "purpose": "Import various modules and handle deprecation warning for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (LowLevel, APIError, Parameters, JLink).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly manages imports and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to switch between relative and absolute imports; deprecation warning issued without security concerns; no suspicious code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules from the current package, falling back to absolute imports if an exception occurs. It issues a deprecation warning to inform users. No user input, environment variables, network activity, or other data flows are involved. The import structure and warning are standard practices. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import and warning pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages module imports and a deprecation notice, posing no threat.",
