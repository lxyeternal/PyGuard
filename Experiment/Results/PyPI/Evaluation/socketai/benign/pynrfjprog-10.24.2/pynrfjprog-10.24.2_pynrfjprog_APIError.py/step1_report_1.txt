  "purpose": "Define error codes and a custom exception class for handling errors related to nrfjprogdll, a DLL for Nordic Semiconductor debugging tools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; error messages are generated internally and do not involve external data inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no source-to-sink data flows; error handling is internal and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard patterns for defining enums and exception classes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for error codes from the nrfjprogdll library, along with a custom exception class for handling these errors. The exception class formats error messages and optionally logs them, but does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage appears to be for structured error handling within a larger, presumably legitimate, application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining error codes and a custom exception; it shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions purely as an error handling utility for the nrfjprogdll library. No malware indicators or security risks identified.",
