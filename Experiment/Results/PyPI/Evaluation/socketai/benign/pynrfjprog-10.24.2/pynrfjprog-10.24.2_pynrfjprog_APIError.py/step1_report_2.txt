  "purpose": "Define error codes and a custom exception class for handling errors from the nrfjprog DLL related to Nordic Semiconductor device programming.",
  "sources": "Import statements, enum definitions, class definitions, and the __init__ method of APIError.",
  "sinks": "Logging function (log) which may output error strings, but does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Error code passed to APIError, which constructs an error message string, optionally logs it, and raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of enum definitions representing error codes and a custom exception class to handle these errors. It imports modules conditionally, defines an enum with static integer values, and constructs error messages in the exception class. There are no code injection points, no use of untrusted input beyond error codes, and no network or file operations that could be malicious. The logging function is optional and only logs error strings. Overall, the code is straightforward, typical for error handling in a hardware interface library, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured error handling module for a device programming library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The implementation is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.",
