{
  "purpose": "Define error codes and custom exception for handling errors related to NRFJPROG DLL interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and class/method definitions; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code logs error strings if a log function is provided, but does not process untrusted input or produce output to external systems beyond logging.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks that could cause security issues; error codes and messages are internally generated and formatted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward, defining constants and a custom exception.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration of error codes and a custom exception class that formats error messages based on error codes. It includes a fallback import pattern for Parameters. The exception class optionally logs error strings. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure and content are consistent with standard error handling implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of error code definitions and exception handling for a DLL interface. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for managing error reporting related to NRFJPROG DLL interactions.",
