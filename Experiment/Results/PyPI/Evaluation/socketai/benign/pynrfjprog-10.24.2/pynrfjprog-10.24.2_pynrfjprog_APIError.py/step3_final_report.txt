{
  "purpose": "Defines error codes for NRFJPROG DLL operations and provides a custom exception class for error handling and logging.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions and error message formatting within the exception class.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data inputs or outputs processed.",
  "flows": "Error code passed to the exception constructor, formatted into a message, optionally logged, then raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static utility module for error handling, with enum definitions for error codes and a custom exception class that formats and logs error messages. It does not process untrusted data, perform network or file operations, or execute dynamic code. The import fallback is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The logging is optional and only outputs error strings, posing no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static error handling utility for the NRFJPROG DLL. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
