{
  "purpose": "Define a MultiAPI class that extends LowLevel.API to support multiple instantiations and provide deprecated methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the fallback imports, and the class constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules and methods, but no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to module usage, class initialization flows through __init__, and deprecated methods modify internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of deprecated functions is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import dependencies, falling back if necessary, which is common. It issues a deprecation warning about a module. The MultiAPI class inherits from LowLevel.API, with an __init__ method that sets internal state and calls the superclass constructor. Deprecated methods are present for backward compatibility. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a wrapper class with deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
