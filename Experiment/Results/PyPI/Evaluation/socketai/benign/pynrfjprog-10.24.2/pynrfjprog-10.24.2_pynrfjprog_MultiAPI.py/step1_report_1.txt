{
  "purpose": "Define a MultiAPI class that inherits from LowLevel.API for handling multiple API instantiations, with deprecated warnings for old methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements (local or relative modules), warnings.warn call, class constructor, method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls within class (super().__init__), warnings.warn, self._terminated flag, method return values.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> class definition -> constructor -> method calls (is_alive, terminate).",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with try-except fallback; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports, warnings, and class method definitions. It uses a try-except block for import compatibility, which is common. The warning indicates deprecation of a module. The class manages an internal termination flag and inherits functionality from LowLevel.API. No user input handling, network access, or sensitive data manipulation is observed. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for API management with deprecated method warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, maintainable module.",
