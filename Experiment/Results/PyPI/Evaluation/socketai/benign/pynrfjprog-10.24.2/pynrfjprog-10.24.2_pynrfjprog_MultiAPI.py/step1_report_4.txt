{
  "purpose": "Define a MultiAPI class that extends LowLevel.API for managing multiple API instances with deprecation warnings for older methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules LowLevel, Parameters, APIError, JLink; class constructor; method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from imports to class constructor; method calls within class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for imports may indicate compatibility adjustments; deprecation warnings are present but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and defines a class extending a base API class. It issues a deprecation warning for future removal of the MultiAPI class. Methods are simple wrappers for internal flags and deprecated functions. No input/output handling, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. The import pattern with try-except is common for handling relative and absolute imports. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly provides deprecation notices and simple state management.",
