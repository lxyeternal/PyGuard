{
  "purpose": "Defines a MultiAPI class inheriting from LowLevel.API, managing deprecation warnings and internal termination state.",
  "sources": "Import statements with fallback handling for relative and absolute imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network access, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls that modify internal _terminated flag; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for imports is standard but could be exploited if source files are compromised; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class with deprecation warning and internal state management. It performs no malicious activity, no data leaks, and contains no obfuscation. The import fallback pattern is common but could be a minor risk if the source is compromised. Overall, the code is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, maintainable API wrapper with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
