The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 for maximum accuracy."

The existing malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Slightly lowering the risk score to 0.1 could reflect minimal risk associated with permission modifications, but overall, the code is safe."
