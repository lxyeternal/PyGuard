  "purpose": "A parser for Intel HEX files that reads lines, interprets record types, and organizes data into memory segments for further use.",
  "sources": "File input line reading, record data extraction from each line.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading lines -> parsing record type and data -> updating segments and addresses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements an Intel HEX parser, handling different record types and address calculations. It manages segments efficiently and maintains compatibility with Python 2 and 3. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The parsing logic appears correct, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose as a file parser.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented Intel HEX parser with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
