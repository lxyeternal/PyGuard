{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to locate the SEGGER JLINK DLL, mainly for internal use and third-party support.",
  "sources": "Imports LowLevel module (either relative or absolute import), and uses LowLevel.API().find_jlink_path() function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is transmitted or leaked, nor are there any sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "The function find_latest_dll() calls LowLevel.API().find_jlink_path(), which likely performs system-level file path searches.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecated warning about future removal, but no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a warning about deprecation, and a simple function that delegates to a potentially system-dependent method for locating a DLL. No malicious logic, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning, indicating ongoing maintenance or transition.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility wrapper for locating a DLL with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It relies on the LowLevel module's internal functions, which are not included here. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
