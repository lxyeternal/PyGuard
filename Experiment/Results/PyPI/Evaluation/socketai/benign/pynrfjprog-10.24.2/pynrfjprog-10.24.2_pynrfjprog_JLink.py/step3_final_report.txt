  "purpose": "Utility functions to locate the SEGGER JLINK DLL, primarily used for system-dependent DLL search.",
  "sources": "Importing LowLevel module; calling LowLevel.API().find_jlink_path() to locate DLL.",
  "sinks": "The function calls an external method to find DLL path; no untrusted data or external communication involved.",
  "flows": "Input: System environment; Output: DLL path returned by find_jlink_path() via find_latest_dll().",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Use of fallback import is standard; deprecation warning is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that imports a module, issues a deprecation warning, and defines a function delegating to an external DLL search method. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reliance on an external method is standard for system DLL searches and does not indicate malicious intent. The deprecation warning is a maintenance note, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
