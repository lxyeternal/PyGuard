  "purpose": "Implementation of an asyncio-based RTT bidirectional transport class, managing data flow, exceptions, and resource cleanup for communication over RTT channels.",
  "sources": "External API calls such as rtt_async_write, rtt_async_callback_stop, and data received callbacks; reading connected SNR; data passed to callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Data written via rtt_async_write; exception propagation to event loop; callback functions invoked with received data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API callbacks into asyncio protocol methods; write data via rtt_async_write; errors propagated through _fatal_error; cleanup via ThreadPoolExecutor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of ThreadPoolExecutor for cleanup is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asyncio transport implementation for RTT communication, with proper exception handling, callback wrapping, and resource cleanup. It relies on external API calls presumed to be from a trusted library. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The callback wrappers handle exceptions gracefully, and resource cleanup is managed via thread pools. No hardcoded secrets or network anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured asyncio RTT transport class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores should reflect a safe implementation: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
