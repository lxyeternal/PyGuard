  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code and the reasoning, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The code handles exceptions properly, uses thread pools for cleanup, and interacts with external APIs in a standard manner.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard asyncio patterns, exception handling, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard implementation, exception handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score reflects minimal concern; no malicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on proper data flow, exception handling, and cleanup routines. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores and conclusion are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** The analysis highlights standard asyncio patterns, exception handling, and notes the use of ThreadPoolExecutor for cleanup, which is unconventional but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected; the low security risk is justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a typical asyncio transport implementation for RTT communication, with proper exception handling, callback wrapping, and resource cleanup. It relies on external API calls presumed to be from a trusted library.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily due to the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal security concerns, mostly about standard exception handling and resource management.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears legitimate and secure. No further action needed based on this analysis.",
