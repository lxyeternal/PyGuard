  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It reads README, imports 'mando' to get version, and calls setuptools.setup().\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the unusual try-except import pattern. No malicious code or network activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.1, but justified as the import pattern is somewhat unconventional.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, just a different approach to obtaining version info.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup with try-except for import. No suspicious code or data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, straightforward setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor anomaly is the unconventional try-except pattern for importing 'mando' to get the version, but this is not harmful.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports appropriately assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risks are minimal or zero.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious activity, network calls, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Assumptions challenged:** All claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on standard, well-understood patterns; no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the absence of actual risks) — the slight elevation is due to the unconventional import handling, but it's not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1, but likely 0)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature.",
