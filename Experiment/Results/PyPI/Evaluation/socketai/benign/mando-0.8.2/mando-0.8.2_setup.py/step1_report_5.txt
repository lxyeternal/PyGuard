  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mando' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file, importing 'mando', attempting to get 'mando' version, defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> setting package info -> dependency import and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import handling of 'mando' with exception capture, but no malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading README content, handling import errors, and configuring setup parameters. The 'try-except' block retrieves 'mando' version if available, or captures the exception object, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected. All dependencies and metadata are typical for a setup script. No signs of malicious or malicious intent activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
