{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mando' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file, importing 'mando' module, importing 'os' and 'setuptools' modules.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function, which could execute the package installation process.",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst -> importing 'mando' -> setting dependencies -> executing setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "Attempt to import 'mando' and fallback on exception to get version; no use of untrusted input, no suspicious code patterns or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup procedures for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, attempts to import the 'mando' package to retrieve its version, and then calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No user input is processed, no dynamic code execution based on untrusted data, and no obfuscated or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The try-except block only handles ImportError for the 'mando' import, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
