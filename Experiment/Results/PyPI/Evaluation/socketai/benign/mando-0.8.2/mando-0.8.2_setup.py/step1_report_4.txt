{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'mando' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file; importing 'os', 'setuptools', and optionally 'mando'; accessing 'mando.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or environment variable sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from README; attempts to import 'mando' to retrieve version; passes static metadata to setuptools.setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The 'try-except' around 'import mando' is standard; no unusual data flows or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup, importing modules, and reading a README file. The optional import of 'mando' and usage of its version is standard for dynamic versioning. No data is read from untrusted sources; no dangerous code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code structure is straightforward, and all operations are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious behaviors or supply chain threats.",
