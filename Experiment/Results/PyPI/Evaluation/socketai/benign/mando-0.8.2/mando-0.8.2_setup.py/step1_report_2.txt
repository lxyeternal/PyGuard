{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'mando' Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing 'os', 'setuptools', and conditionally 'mando'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Read README file -> import 'mando' -> assign version -> setup package with provided metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'mando' with fallback to exception version, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious commands, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package. It reads a README file, tries to import 'mando' to get its version, and then calls setuptools.setup() with metadata and dependencies. The import of 'mando' inside a try-except block is somewhat unusual but not malicious; it may be intended to ensure the version is obtained if the package is installed. There are no network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
