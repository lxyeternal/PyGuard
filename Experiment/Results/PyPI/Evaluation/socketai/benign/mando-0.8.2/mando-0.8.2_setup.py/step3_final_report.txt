  "sources": "Reading README file, importing 'mando' to retrieve version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> importing 'mando' -> accessing '__version__' -> passing data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual try-except import pattern for 'mando', but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with a try-except block to import 'mando' and retrieve its version. It reads the README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The import pattern is slightly unconventional but common for optional dependencies or version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score reflects the unusual import pattern but does not indicate any threat. Overall, the code is safe and well-formed.",
