  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and reasoning.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script. It notes the try-except block for importing 'mando' and fetching the version, which is typical. No suspicious behavior or malware is found.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the unusual but benign try-except for importing 'mando'. No malicious activity or suspicious code is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The slight risk might be due to the unusual import handling, but it's not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, though the risk score could be lowered to 0, given no actual security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The handling of 'mando' import and version retrieval is standard. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's confidence is high.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is typical for a setup script. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the logic is straightforward. The 'try-except' block for 'mando' import is standard, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, code injection, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor point is the unusual import handling, but it is standard practice in setup scripts to handle missing dependencies gracefully. There are no security risks, secrets, or backdoors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- Obfuscated scores should stay at **0**.\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to **0**, given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature, which is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package.",
