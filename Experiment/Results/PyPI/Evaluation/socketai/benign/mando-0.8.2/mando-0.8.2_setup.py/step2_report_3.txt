  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It reads README, imports 'mando' to get version, and calls `setuptools.setup()`.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence, given the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with acknowledgment that the 'try-except' import of 'mando' is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, possibly due to the unusual import handling, but not significant.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also a standard setup script, with the exception handling for 'import mando' noted as unconventional but benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard setup process, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code indicate any malicious activity. The 'try-except' import pattern, while somewhat unusual, is a common pattern to handle optional dependencies or to retrieve version info if the package is installed.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted data sources.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** The setup script is standard, with no embedded secrets, network calls, or code injection points.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Note:** The slightly elevated 'securityRisk' in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is not justified given the code's simplicity and lack of any risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, all reports are consistent in concluding that this is a typical, benign setup script. The scores assigned are appropriate, with no need for adjustments.\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat or malicious intent, and the reports accurately reflect that.",
