{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mando' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file, importing 'mando' module to get version, reading environment variables via os, importing setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into critical system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> setting up package metadata. Importing 'mando' -> accessing __version__.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import handling with exception capturing 'e.version', which is unconventional. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. The import error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging Python modules. It reads the README file, attempts to import 'mando' to determine its version, and then calls setuptools.setup() with package details. No user input is read, no network activity, no code injection, or malicious logic is present. The exception handling for ImportError is standard, and the version assignment is straightforward. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for the 'mando' package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-formed setup script.",
