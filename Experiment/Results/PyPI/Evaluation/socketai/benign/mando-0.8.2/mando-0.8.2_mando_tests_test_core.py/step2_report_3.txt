  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward CLI setup using 'mando' with multiple commands and options, primarily for demonstration/testing. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are present.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the benign nature)\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard CLI setup with no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected. The score is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a CLI with multiple commands and options, used for testing. No malicious or obfuscated code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, but acceptable given the context)\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—standard CLI setup, no external or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—benign CLI code for testing, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports consistently show no malicious activity. The code is static, purely for CLI setup and testing.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk scores:** The scores are very low (0.1) across the board, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not perform any external network operations, file manipulations, or execute untrusted code.\n- The use of 'pytest' for testing is standard and does not introduce malicious behavior.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and designed for demonstration/testing purposes.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate for a benign CLI setup with testing code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign CLI application for demonstration and testing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that no external dependencies or runtime behaviors introduce vulnerabilities, but based on the static code provided, the risk remains negligible.",
