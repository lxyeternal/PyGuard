  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, hardcoded strings, dynamic eval/exec calls, encoded strings, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, or embedded payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as encoded strings or eval/exec leading to execution of code or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials or URLs, suspicious control flow, inconsistent or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, low obfuscation, and low security risk. Report 2 shows high obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec, justified by suspicious patterns and high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 are consistent with their benign or cautious assessments. The scores align with the described code characteristics, with only Report 2 warranting high suspicion. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with isolated concerns about obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits mostly benign behavior with some reports indicating suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code features. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk remains low, but further review of suspicious patterns in Report 2 is recommended if involved in critical systems.",
