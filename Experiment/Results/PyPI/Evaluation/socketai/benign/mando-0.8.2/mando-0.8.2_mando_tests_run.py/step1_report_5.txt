{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to run pytest with specific options depending on Python version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes pytest.main() with command-line options, which is a safe operation in this context.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked, then depending on the version, pytest.main() is called with different arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of pytest for test automation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and pytest modules. It checks the Python interpreter version, then calls pytest.main() with version-specific arguments. No user input, no data leaks, no code injection, and no suspicious network or system operations. The code performs a straightforward version check and test invocation. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script that conditionally runs pytest with specific options based on Python version. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
