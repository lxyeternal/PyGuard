{
  "purpose": "The script runs pytest with specific command-line arguments based on the Python version, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version information via sys.version_info, and the command-line arguments are predefined within the code.",
  "sinks": "The pytest.main() function is invoked with static arguments; no untrusted data is used in sink functions.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine which pytest command-line argument to pass, then pytest.main() is called accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of pytest in a script is common for test runners.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and pytest modules. It checks the Python version and calls pytest.main() with different arguments based on that. No user input or untrusted data influences the command arguments. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The script functions as a version-dependent test runner trigger.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script designed to invoke pytest with version-specific options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intentional for test automation purposes.",
