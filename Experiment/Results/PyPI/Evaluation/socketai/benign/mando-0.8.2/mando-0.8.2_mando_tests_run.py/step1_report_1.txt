  "purpose": "To run pytest with specific options based on Python version, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "sys module (reading sys.version_info), pytest module (importing and invoking pytest.main())",
  "sinks": "pytest.main() invocation (executes test framework commands)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info read -> conditional check -> pytest.main() call with arguments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation. No external data input or output observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and pytest modules. It then checks the Python version. If Python version is 3.10 or higher, it runs pytest with '--strict-markers'; otherwise, it runs pytest with '--strict'. Both are valid pytest options for strict test marker handling. The code is straightforward and only invokes pytest based on version condition. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code serves as a test runner wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version-dependent pytest launcher with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be used for testing purposes with no suspicious behavior.",
