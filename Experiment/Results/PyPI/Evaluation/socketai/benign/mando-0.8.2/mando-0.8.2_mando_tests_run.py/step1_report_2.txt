{
  "purpose": "This script executes pytest with specific command-line options depending on the Python version.",
  "sources": "The script reads the Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The script calls pytest.main, which executes pytest commands that could run tests or scripts, but as is, it does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script checks Python version and then calls pytest.main with specific arguments based on the version, without involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of pytest is standard for testing, with no suspicious modifications or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and pytest, then checks the Python version. Based on the version, it calls pytest.main with different arguments ('--strict-markers' or '--strict'). There are no user inputs or external data sources; the code's purpose appears to be controlling pytest execution. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The script simply executes pytest with predefined options based on the environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward script for running pytest with different options depending on Python version. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, functioning as a simple test runner launcher.",
