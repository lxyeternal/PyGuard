{
  "purpose": "This script runs pytest with different options based on the Python version, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys module to check Python version and imports pytest to run tests.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code reads system information (Python version) and then calls pytest.main() with specific arguments based on the version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the code appears standard for running tests with pytest under different Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by checking if it is run as the main module. It imports sys and pytest, then determines the Python version. Depending on whether the version is 3.10 or higher, it runs pytest with different command-line arguments. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed. The code's purpose is straightforward, aimed at running tests with specific settings based on Python version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test runner script for pytest, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a version check and runs pytest accordingly. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
