  "purpose": "A version-dependent pytest launcher that runs pytest with specific strictness options based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version check",
  "sinks": "pytest.main() invocation with static arguments",
  "flows": "version check -> pytest.main() with arguments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and test invocation",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and pytest, checks Python version, and runs pytest with different options accordingly. No external input, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The logic is correct and standard for environment-specific test execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, environment-aware pytest launcher with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
