  "purpose": "Define a command-line program structure using the 'mando' library's core components.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'mando.core', assignment of 'main.command', 'main.arg', 'main.parse', 'main.execute'",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks evident",
  "flows": "Imports -> Object creation -> Attribute assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed; code appears straightforward and typical for CLI applications",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Program' from 'mando.core', creates an instance 'main', and assigns its attributes to variables. It does not process user input, handle data, or perform operations beyond setup. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple setup for a CLI application using the 'mando' library without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
