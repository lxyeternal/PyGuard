  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup for a command-line interface using the 'mando' library.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or code execution is observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The version string is standard.\n- The code simply imports, instantiates, and assigns attributes from 'Program'.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches all reports; the attributes `command`, `arg`, `parse`, and `execute` are assigned from a `Program` instance.\n- No issues are present in the code snippet regarding malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; they all correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **confidence:** mostly 1, with one at 0.9 — reasonable given the simplicity.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0, appropriate.\n  - **malware:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0, justified.\n\n- **Potential concern:** Since all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is very simple, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Malware and risk justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk (0):** No evident vulnerabilities or dangerous constructs.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard CLI setup with no malicious or risky elements.\n- The malware score should remain **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay **0**.\n- The overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
