  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup for a command-line interface using the 'mando' library.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, file operations, or code execution are mentioned.\n- The version string is a typical semantic version, with no suspicious content.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed.\n- The code simply imports, instantiates, and assigns attributes from a known library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears benign. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only involves setting up a CLI framework, the risk of malware or vulnerabilities is negligible.\n- There is no evidence to justify raising the scores above zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at 0.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup for a command-line application using the 'mando' library. No security issues or malicious behaviors are present or implied.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.",
