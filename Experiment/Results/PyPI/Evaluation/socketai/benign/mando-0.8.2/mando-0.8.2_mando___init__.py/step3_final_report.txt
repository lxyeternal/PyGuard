  "purpose": "Setup for a command-line interface using the 'mando' library.",
  "sources": "Import from 'mando.core', instantiation of 'Program', attribute assignments from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate Program -> assign command, arg, parse, execute attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup for a CLI application, importing 'Program' from 'mando.core', creating an instance, and assigning its attributes to variables. There are no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores as 0, and a security risk score as 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
