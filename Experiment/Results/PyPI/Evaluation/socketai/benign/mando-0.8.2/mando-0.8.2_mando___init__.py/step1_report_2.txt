{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string and imports and initializes a command-line interface program from the 'mando' library.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment '__version__' and import of 'Program' from 'mando.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data or untrusted sources are processed or used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely sets up a command-line program object and assigns its methods to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, imports a 'Program' class from 'mando.core', instantiates it, and creates aliases for its methods. It lacks any user input handling, external data processing, or system modifications. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet for setting up a command-line interface using the 'mando' library. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
