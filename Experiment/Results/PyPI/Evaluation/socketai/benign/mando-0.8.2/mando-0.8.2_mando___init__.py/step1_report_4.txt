  "purpose": "Define version and import core command-line interface functionality from the 'mando' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mando.core' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data or user input handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes and assigns objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, imports 'Program' from the 'mando.core' package, and initializes a 'Program' instance. It then creates references to the command, argument parsing, parsing, and execution methods of the 'Program' object. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard setup for a command-line interface using the 'mando' library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for a CLI application using the 'mando' package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
