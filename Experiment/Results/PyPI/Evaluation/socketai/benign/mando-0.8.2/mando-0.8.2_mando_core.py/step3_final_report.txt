  "purpose": "A CLI framework that converts Python functions into command-line commands using argparse, with support for docstring parsing and subcommands.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, inspects function signatures and docstrings for command configuration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or system modifications; internal command execution.",
  "flows": "Command-line input flows into argument parsing, which maps to function calls without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard modules (argparse, inspect) to build a command-line interface that dynamically creates commands from functions. It parses docstrings for help messages and parameter info, and supports subcommands via a decorator pattern. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The optional 'argcomplete' dependency is benign if dependencies are trusted. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious code. Security considerations are minimal; the main risk could be if functions invoked are untrusted, but the code itself does not process untrusted data beyond argument parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard CLI utility framework with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
