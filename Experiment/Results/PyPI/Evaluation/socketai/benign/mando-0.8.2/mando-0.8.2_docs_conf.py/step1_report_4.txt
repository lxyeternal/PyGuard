  "flows": "None detected; configuration variables are static, no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code is a standard Sphinx config file with no embedded or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, sets configuration parameters for documentation generation, and defines paths, themes, and project info. No user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be boilerplate configuration for Sphinx with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
