  "purpose": "Configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation for the 'mando' project.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and os modules; no other data input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network operations, file modifications, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward configuration with no dynamic execution, eval, exec, or similar functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file, setting up project metadata, themes, extensions, and output options. There are no imports or code that execute external commands, handle user input, or perform any operations beyond static configuration. No malicious patterns such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for documentation setup and contains no malicious behavior.",
