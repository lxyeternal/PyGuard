  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, setting up project-specific parameters and options.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard modules 'sys' and 'os', static variable assignments for configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, network communication, or untrusted input processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard modules and defines static configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. There are no dynamic operations, external communications, or handling of untrusted data. The structure is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All configuration options are standard and serve documentation purposes. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
