  "purpose": "A unit test verifying Unicode docstring handling in a CLI framework using 'mando'.",
  "sources": "The test function 'some_command' with a Unicode docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The command registration flow does not involve untrusted input; the assertion checks the type of the docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'unittest' and 'Program' from 'mando', creates a 'Program' instance, and defines a test class with a single test method. Inside, it defines a command with a Unicode docstring and asserts that the docstring is not of type 'bytes'. The code is straightforward, with no external data, network activity, or secrets. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. The code's purpose is to ensure Unicode support, a common and safe pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for Unicode docstring handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
