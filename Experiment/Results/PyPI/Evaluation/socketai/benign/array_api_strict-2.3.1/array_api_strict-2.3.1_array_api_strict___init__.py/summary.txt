  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a minimal array API testing environment. Its dynamic extension loading mechanism is controlled and typical for such use cases. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected, and the security risk is very low. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) due to the dynamic extension pattern, which is safe under proper internal control."
