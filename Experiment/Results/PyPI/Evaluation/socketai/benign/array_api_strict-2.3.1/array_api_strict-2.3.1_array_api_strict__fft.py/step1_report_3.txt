{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions for various FFT operations, enabling compatibility with Array API standards and integrating with a custom Array class and extension requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameter 'x' (Array objects), and in functions like fftfreq and rfftfreq, it reads parameters 'n', 'd', 'dtype', and 'device'. It also reads extension requirements via the requires_extension decorator.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the conversion of numpy arrays to Array objects via Array._new, and dtype conversions via astype. These are used to process data but do not directly leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input Array objects through numpy FFT functions, then is wrapped into custom Array objects, with potential dtype conversions based on input types. No external or untrusted data sources, network operations, or code execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are observed. The code only performs data processing and type conversions. The use of numpy's FFT functions appears straightforward and safe. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple FFT-related functions that serve as wrappers around numpy's FFT functions, adding type and device checks. The use of type annotations, extension requirements, and data processing appears standard. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is structured and clear, with no suspicious anomalies. The overall design aims to extend numpy FFT functionality within a custom framework securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, well-structured wrapper functions around numpy FFT functions, intended for array manipulation within a larger framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns are detected.",
