{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around numpy's FFT functions providing type and extension validation within a custom Array framework.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'x._array', parameters like 'n', 'axis', 'norm', 's', 'axes', 'dtype', 'device'.",
  "sinks": "Data processed through numpy FFT functions, results wrapped into Array objects; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'x._array' into numpy functions, then into Array._new, with dtype conversions via 'astype'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard dtype and device validation, no dynamic code or external system access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of wrapper functions around numpy's FFT routines, performing input validation, dtype enforcement, and device support checks. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The data flow is controlled, with no external or network interactions. The use of 'astype' for dtype conversions is standard practice. Overall, the code's purpose is purely computational, serving as a safe extension within the framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a secure, type-safe wrapper around numpy FFT functions, suitable for use without concern.",
