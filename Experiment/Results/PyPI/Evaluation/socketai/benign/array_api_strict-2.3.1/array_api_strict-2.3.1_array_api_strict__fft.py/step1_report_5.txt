{
  "purpose": "Provides FFT and related frequency transform functions wrapped for Array objects, ensuring compatibility with Array API standards and numpy's FFT implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Array._array, device attribute, and function parameters such as n, axis, s, axes, and dtype.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data through Array._new; performs type casting via astype; raises errors on invalid dtype or device.",
  "flows": "Source: input array and parameters -> np.fft functions -> Array._new -> optional astype -> return Array",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external network connections; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no unusual code patterns or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a wrapper around numpy's FFT functions, adding input validation, dtype conversions, and device handling. It checks for allowed dtypes, validates device support, and performs type casting when needed. No external or untrusted data sources, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no code that performs malicious system actions are present. The code appears to be intended for mathematical computations with no malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for FFT operations with proper input validation and dtype management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
