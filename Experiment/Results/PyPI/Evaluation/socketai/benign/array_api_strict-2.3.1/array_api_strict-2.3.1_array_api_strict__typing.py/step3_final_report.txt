  "purpose": "Type annotations and protocol definitions for array support, device, dtype, and related interfaces in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_array_object, _dtypes, _info), standard library (sys, typing), and future annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external system calls, or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and protocol method signatures; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' for SupportsBufferProtocol and PyCapsule, which is typical in stub files but reduces type safety; version-dependent import for SupportsBufferProtocol.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type annotation module defining types, protocols, and TypedDicts for a Python array library. It employs standard practices like future annotations, version checks, and internal module imports. No dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation is present. The use of 'Any' is common in type stubs and not malicious. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores across reports are consistent with benign, purely static code. The high security risk score in some reports (e.g., 0.9) is unjustified; a score of around 0.1 would be more appropriate, reflecting minimal risk associated with type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type definition module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'Any' is standard in stub files and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are generally accurate, though the high risk score in the first report should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
