{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and protocols for a Python module, including device types, data types, and support interfaces.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys, typing), local modules (_array_object, _dtypes, _info), and future annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external data handling, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Any type for SupportsBufferProtocol and PyCapsule, which is common for compatibility but can be a concern if misused; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type definitions, protocols, and typed dictionaries for internal use within a package. It conditionally imports Buffer based on Python version, uses standard typing constructs, and defines interfaces such as SupportsDLPack. No suspicious logic, data handling, or external communications are present. The use of Any types for certain protocols is standard for compatibility but does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward type annotation module, setting up internal type protocols and data structures with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
