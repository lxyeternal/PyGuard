  "purpose": "Define type annotations and protocol interfaces for a Python library related to array operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, and relative module imports (__array_namespace_info__, _array_object, _dtypes, _info).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling evident; no network, file, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' for SupportsBufferProtocol and PyCapsule could be considered flexible but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Version-dependent import with sys, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases, protocol definitions, and TypedDicts for use in a larger codebase. It imports modules and types safely, and conditionally imports collections.abc.Buffer based on Python version. No execution of untrusted input, no network activity, and no suspicious dynamic code. The presence of 'Any' types in SupportsBufferProtocol and PyCapsule is typical in type stubs where full typing isn't available or necessary. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign type definition module for a Python array library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The only potential concern is the use of 'Any', which is common in type annotations but does not indicate malicious intent.",
