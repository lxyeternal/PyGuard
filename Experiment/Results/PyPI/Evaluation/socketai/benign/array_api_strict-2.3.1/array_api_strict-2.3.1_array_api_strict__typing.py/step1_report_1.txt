{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and related type protocols for a Python module, including device, dtype, and buffer support types.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, and internal modules (_array_object, _dtypes, _info). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows detected. No network, file, or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly declares types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Any for SupportsBufferProtocol and PyCapsule is generic; no explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. Version-dependent import for SupportsBufferProtocol is normal. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic code execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines types, protocols, and TypedDicts for a larger library, with no input handling, no system calls, or data transformations. Use of __future__ import and version checks is standard for compatibility. The use of Any indicates flexibility rather than suspicion. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code does not interact with external systems or perform any operations beyond type annotations and definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for type annotations and protocols, with no suspicious behaviors.",
