{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and protocol interfaces for a Python array library, primarily for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (sys, typing), internal modules (_array_object, _dtypes, _info), and system information (sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. The code does not perform I/O, network operations, or data processing that could lead to leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily defines type aliases and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. Conditional import of SupportsBufferProtocol based on sys.version_info is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines type annotations, protocols, and TypedDicts for an array library, with no dynamic execution or data handling. Usage of __future__ import and conditional imports is standard. No malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation module for a Python array library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily serves as a static type definitions file.",
