{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and assigns mathematical constants and an array axis from the numpy library.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy library and accesses numpy's constants (e, inf, nan, pi) and the newaxis attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the numpy library to local variables but no untrusted data input or external data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and assigns commonly used constants and attributes to local variables. All operations are straightforward and involve no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The constants are standard mathematical values, and the newaxis attribute is used for array manipulation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup of numpy constants and attributes, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
