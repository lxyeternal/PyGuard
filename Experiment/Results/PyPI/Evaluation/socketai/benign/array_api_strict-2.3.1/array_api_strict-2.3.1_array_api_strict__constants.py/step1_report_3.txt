{
  "purpose": "The code imports the NumPy library and defines several mathematical constants from it for potential use in calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data indirectly from the NumPy library when importing 'numpy as np' and accesses constants like np.e, np.inf, np.nan, and np.pi.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform output; it only defines variables from imported constants.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the imported numpy constants to local variables (e, inf, nan, pi, newaxis), but there are no further data manipulations or transfers to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard for numerical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the numpy library and assigns several of its constants to local variables. These constants are commonly used in mathematical computations. There is no input handling, no data processing, no network activity, and no potential malicious operations. The code appears to be standard setup code for numerical calculations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and benign setup script that imports mathematical constants from numpy. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present. It is safe to use.",
