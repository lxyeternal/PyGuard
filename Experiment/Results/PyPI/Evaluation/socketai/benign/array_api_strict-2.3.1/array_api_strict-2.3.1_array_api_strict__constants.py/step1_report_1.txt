  "purpose": "Define common mathematical constants and array property from the numpy library for use in scientific computations.",
  "sources": "Importing the numpy library, accessing attributes np.e, np.inf, np.nan, np.pi, and np.newaxis.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leak, no output, no external communication.",
  "flows": "Import numpy -> assign constants from numpy attributes to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the numpy library and assigns several of its constants and properties to local variables. All operations are straightforward and standard, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be setting up for mathematical computations and uses no malicious patterns or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup of mathematical constants and an array property from numpy, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
