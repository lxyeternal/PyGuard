{
  "purpose": "Defines mathematical constants and an alias for numpy's newaxis for use in numerical computations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; constants are assigned from numpy module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward assignments of numpy constants to variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and assigns several of its constants (e, inf, nan, pi, newaxis) to local variables. There are no functions, data input/output, or complex operations. All usage appears standard and intended for mathematical or numerical processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility module for constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
