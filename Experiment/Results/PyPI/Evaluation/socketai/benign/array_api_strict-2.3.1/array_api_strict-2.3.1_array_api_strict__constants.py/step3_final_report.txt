  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and assigns several of its constants and attributes to local variables. It involves no data input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The operations are standard and benign. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is a simple setup for mathematical constants, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All assessments correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
