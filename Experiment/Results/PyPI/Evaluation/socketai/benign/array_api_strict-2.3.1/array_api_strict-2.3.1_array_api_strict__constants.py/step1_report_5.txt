  "purpose": "Define constants and aliases for numpy mathematical constants and array manipulations",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present",
  "sinks": "No data output, data leak, or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of numpy constants and aliasing without context; no suspicious code or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, assigns several numpy constants (e, inf, nan, pi) to variables, and creates an alias for np.newaxis. All operations are straightforward assignments of known, safe constants. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to serve as a utility or setup for numerical computations, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving to set up constants for numerical calculations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
