  "purpose": "This code provides wrappers and utility functions for linear algebra operations, adhering to the Array API standard, primarily using numpy functions with added checks and extensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays (e.g., in functions like cholesky, cross, det, eigh, eigvalsh, inv, matrix_norm, matrix_power, matrix_rank, outer, pinv, qr, slogdet, solve, svd, svdvals, trace, vector_norm, matmul, tensordot, matrix_transpose, vecdot). It accesses array data via x._array, device attributes, and possibly input parameters like axes or offsets.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from input arrays, which may be used in calculations or returned in Array objects. Functions like np.linalg.* are called with these arrays, and the results are wrapped in Array objects. No direct data leakage or system command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input Array objects to numpy functions (e.g., np.linalg.*), then wrapped into new Array objects for output. Checks on dtype and device prevent cross-device or invalid data usage. No untrusted input is directly executed or written to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. All operations are standard numerical computations. The code does not include hardcoded credentials, network connections, or file manipulations. The use of try-except for numpy imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple wrapper functions for numpy linear algebra routines, with additional type and dtype checks, device consistency enforcement, and optional parameter handling. It employs standard patterns for API compatibility, such as returning namedtuples or wrapped Array objects. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or hidden system access is present. All data is processed within numpy and array wrappers. The imports and function definitions are standard and do not exhibit malicious obfuscation or behavior. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or system tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, standard library wrapper for numpy linear algebra functions. It includes safety checks on data types and devices but no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or hidden data leaks. Overall, it is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
