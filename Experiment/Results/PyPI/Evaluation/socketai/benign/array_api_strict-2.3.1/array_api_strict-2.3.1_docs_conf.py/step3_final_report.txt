  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, themes, and static assets.",
  "sources": "Static imports (sys, os), path modifications, configuration variables, and commented-out code.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network communication, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Static configuration assignment with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out import of 'array_api_strict' but no active malicious or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, static and straightforward. No dynamic code execution, external communication, or data handling involving untrusted sources. Commented-out code is benign. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate a benign setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores all at 0.",
