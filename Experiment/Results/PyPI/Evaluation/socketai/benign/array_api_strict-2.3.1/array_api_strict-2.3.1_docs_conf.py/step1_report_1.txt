  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'array-api-strict' project.",
  "sources": "sys.path.insert, imports, static file references, and HTML theme options.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external communication points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; mainly static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and standard configuration elements; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Sphinx configuration tasks: setting project info, extensions, paths, themes, and options. It imports standard modules (sys, os), modifies sys.path, and sets static paths and HTML options. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external communication is present. All code is standard, well-structured, and lacks obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no code that performs harmful actions, data leaks, or communicates externally beyond referencing static assets. The code appears safe and solely serves configuration purposes.",
