  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, data flows, and potential security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a configuration script for Sphinx, with standard imports, environment variables, URL fetches for version info, and template rendering.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Fetches version info via URL, reads local files, renders templates, and writes files. No untrusted input is executed directly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** URL fetches are for version info, with optional authorization tokens handled securely via environment variables. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a legitimate build configuration, with low security risk. No malware or backdoors.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code performs standard documentation build tasks, with no malicious activity. The security risk is very low (score ~0.2). The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, involving environment variables (NO_MATHJAX, GITHUB_TOKEN), template reading, URL fetching, and code injection into notebooks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL fetches for version info, rendering templates, injecting code snippets based on string detection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of environment variables is standard; GITHUB_TOKEN is optional and handled securely. The injection of code snippets into notebooks based on string detection is a common practice for setting up environments.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. The code is a configuration script for documentation, with safe URL fetches and template rendering.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern could be the injection of code snippets into notebooks, but this is controlled and based on string detection, not untrusted input. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—configuration for Sphinx, fetching version info, environment variables, file I/O.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL fetch for version info, rendering templates, no untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard setup; no suspicious network activity or code injection. Environment variables are used for configuration, not secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code is a typical build script.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is safe. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 (due to external URL fetch, but this is standard).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, involving URL fetches, environment variables, and template rendering.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Fetches version info, reads/writes files, no code execution from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** External URL fetch for version info is standard; environment variables are used for configuration. No malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or backdoors. Standard documentation build code.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—configuration, URL fetches, template rendering.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Fetches version info, renders templates, no untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Only network activity is fetching version info, which is benign. No suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard Sphinx configuration scripts.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected; no network communication to malicious domains, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low; the highest risk is due to external URL fetches, which are standard in build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the external URL fetches but overall very low.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis code is a typical, well-structured build configuration for documentation with no malicious intent.",
