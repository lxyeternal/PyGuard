{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Sphinx autodocumenter that displays only the first line (short summary) of an object's docstring, overriding default behaviors to suppress member listing and directive headers.",
  "sources": "Standard Sphinx API methods: get_doc(), get_sourcename(), process_doc(), and get_docstrings()",
  "sinks": "add_line() method used to output the short summary; no external sinks or data leaks involved",
  "flows": "Retrieval of docstring -> processing to extract first non-empty line -> adding line to documentation output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; code is straightforward and solely for documentation formatting",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign subclass of ModuleLevelDocumenter, overriding methods to show only the first line of docstrings. It uses standard Sphinx methods without external data, network calls, or unsafe operations. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The flow is simple and controlled, with no external sinks or data flows. The code's purpose is purely for presentation, and it does not perform any security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for customizing documentation output. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
