{
  "purpose": "Custom Sphinx autodocumenter that renders only the short summary of an object for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources; standard method calls within the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that output untrusted data to external systems or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code mainly modifies documentation rendering behavior without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom autodocumenter class inheriting from Sphinx's ModuleLevelDocumenter. It overrides methods to suppress certain outputs and only include the short summary line from docstrings. It avoids executing any untrusted code, network operations, or system modifications. The setup function registers this class with Sphinx. All code appears safe, standard, and focused solely on documentation rendering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate customization of Sphinx documentation behavior, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
