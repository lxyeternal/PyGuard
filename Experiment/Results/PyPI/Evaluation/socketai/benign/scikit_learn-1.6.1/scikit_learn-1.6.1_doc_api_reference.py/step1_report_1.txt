{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration data structures and helper functions for generating API documentation for scikit-learn modules, including section definitions, module hooks, and deprecated API listings.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures (dictionaries and lists), and constructs strings via functions (_get_guide, _get_submodule). No external input or untrusted data is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute any commands based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions generate static strings for documentation purposes without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code solely manages documentation configuration data and helper functions for string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data definitions and simple string formatting functions. The functions _get_guide and _get_submodule generate strings based on fixed input parameters, with no dynamic evaluation or external input handling. The API_REFERENCE and DEPRECATED_API_REFERENCE are large static dictionaries holding documentation metadata. There is no code that executes untrusted data, interacts with external systems, or performs any malicious activity. The purpose is purely to facilitate documentation generation for scikit-learn modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration and helper module for API documentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely constructs documentation strings and manages static configuration data. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
