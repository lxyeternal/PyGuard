  "purpose": "Provides functions to resolve URLs linking to source code files in repositories, primarily used for documentation purposes with Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, executes subprocess commands to retrieve Git revision, imports modules, and inspects objects for source file information.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess to get Git revision; imports modules based on user input; accesses object source files and line numbers via introspection; formats URLs for source code links.",
  "flows": "Subprocess call to get revision → module import based on user input → object introspection for source file and line number → URL formatting with source file info.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to execute 'git' commands which can potentially be manipulated if inputs are not controlled; relies heavily on dynamic import and introspection which could be exploited if the module or info inputs are maliciously crafted. No explicit validation of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules and inspects objects to generate source code links, which is typical for documentation tools. The subprocess call to retrieve the git revision could be manipulated if the environment or repository is compromised, but as it executes a fixed command, risk is minimal. The dynamic import and attribute access do not seem to involve user-supplied untrusted data directly, assuming the info parameter is controlled. No external network calls or suspicious data exfiltration is present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Overall, the code functions as intended for source linking with low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for source code linking in documentation workflows. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The primary security consideration is ensuring that input parameters for module and attribute names are sanitized if they originate from untrusted sources, but the code itself does not perform such validation. Overall, the risk is low.",
