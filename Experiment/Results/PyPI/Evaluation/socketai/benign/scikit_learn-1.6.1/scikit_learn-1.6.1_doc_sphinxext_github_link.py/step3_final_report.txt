  "purpose": "Utility for generating source code links for documentation, using git revision info and reflection.",
  "sources": "Reads git revision via subprocess; dynamically imports modules; inspects source files and line numbers.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; subprocess output is controlled and static.",
  "flows": "Subprocess call to get revision -> dynamic import and inspection -> URL formatting with source file info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; standard practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled subprocess calls to retrieve git revision, uses standard reflection to locate source files and line numbers, and formats URLs for source code referencing. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present. The subprocess call is static and unlikely to be exploited. Dynamic import and inspection are typical for documentation tools. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for source linking in documentation workflows. It poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting standard practices and low threat level.",
