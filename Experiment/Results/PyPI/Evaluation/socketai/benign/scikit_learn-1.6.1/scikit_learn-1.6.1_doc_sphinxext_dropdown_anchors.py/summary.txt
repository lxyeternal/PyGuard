  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx extension for enhancing documentation navigation. It performs controlled internal document modifications without malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern—raw HTML insertion—is mitigated by the trusted source of data. Overall, the code poses no security threat, with a malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) due to raw HTML handling, which is acceptable here."
