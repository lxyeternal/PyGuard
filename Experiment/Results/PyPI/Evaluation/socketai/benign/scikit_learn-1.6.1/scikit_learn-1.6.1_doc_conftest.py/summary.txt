  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard test setup script used in open-source projects to manage conditional test execution based on environment and dependency status. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
