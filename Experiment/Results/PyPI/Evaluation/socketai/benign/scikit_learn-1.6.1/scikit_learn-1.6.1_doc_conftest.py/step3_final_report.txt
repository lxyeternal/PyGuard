{
  "purpose": "The code manages test setup, dependency checks, environment variable controls, and dataset existence verification to facilitate conditional test execution within the testing framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., SKLEARN_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS), import statements, dataset file existence checks, version variables for pandas and scipy, and module imports for dependencies like pandas, scikit-image, matplotlib, and cupy.",
  "sinks": "Raises 'SkipTest' exceptions to skip tests based on environment conditions, dependency availability, or dataset presence; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source inputs such as environment variables and import success/failure influence control flow leading to 'SkipTest' exceptions, which determine whether certain tests are executed or skipped.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs detected; code follows standard testing setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks, dependency verification, version comparisons, and dataset existence checks to conditionally skip tests. It employs standard practices such as import error handling and environment variable reading. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage is evident. The use of 'raise SkipTest' is typical for test management. Version checks for pandas and scipy are straightforward. The code's structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard test setup script used in open-source projects to manage conditional test execution based on environment and dependency status. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
