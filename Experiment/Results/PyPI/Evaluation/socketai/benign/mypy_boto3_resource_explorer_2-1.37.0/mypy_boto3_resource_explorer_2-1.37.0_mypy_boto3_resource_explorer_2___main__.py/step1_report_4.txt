  "purpose": "Provides CLI interface to display package information and version details for boto3 ResourceExplorer stub package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs information), potential for command-line argument influence.",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv -> main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code simply outputs static information; no external data fetching or execution of untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print static package information and version to standard output. It checks command-line arguments for '--version' to determine which info to print. No data is fetched from external sources, and no untrusted input is processed in a manner that could cause harm. The logic is straightforward and consistent with CLI tools that display static info. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously-injected code. Overall, it functions as a simple informational CLI script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
