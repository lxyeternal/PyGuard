  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version, controlled by a command-line argument '--version'. It does not process user input beyond checking for this argument, nor does it perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle sensitive data.\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external dependencies.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or logical mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, which aligns with the code content.\n\n- The analysis in each report is accurate: static output, no external data, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns.\n\n- The reasoning is sound, and no flawed assumptions are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n\n  - `malware`: 0\n\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n\n  - `confidence`: 1.0\n\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- The overall assessment of no malicious activity and no security risk is justified.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely informational, static, and has no malicious features, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n\n- All reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0 and `malware` of 0.\n\n**Step 5: Cross-check for any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report content**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward CLI utility for static info display.\n\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, correctly identifying the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
