  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports sys.\n- It defines `print_info()` to output static package info.\n- It defines `print_version()` to output the version.\n- In `main()`, if `--version` is in `sys.argv`, it calls `print_version()`, otherwise `print_info()`.\n- No external data, no user input processing beyond command-line args, no network, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is straightforward and static.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  None. The logic is correct, and the code functions as intended for an informational CLI utility.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **confidence:** 1.0\n\nThese seem appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Risk and Malware Justification:\n- **Why is malware score 0?**  \n  Because there are no malicious actions, no code injection, no network activity, no suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Why is security risk 0?**  \n  The script does not handle untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, does not process sensitive data, and does not interact with external systems.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely informational.\n- No obfuscation or hidden behavior is present.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the code and reports, I agree with their assessments.\n\n**However, considering the simplicity and static nature, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious intent or behavior.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden code.  \n- No security risk from the code as it only outputs static info.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The reports correctly identify no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
