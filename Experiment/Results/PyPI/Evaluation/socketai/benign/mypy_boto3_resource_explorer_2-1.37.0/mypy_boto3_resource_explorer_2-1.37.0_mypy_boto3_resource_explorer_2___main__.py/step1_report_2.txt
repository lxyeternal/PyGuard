  "purpose": "This code serves as a CLI entry point for a Python package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes package info and version info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write(). No untrusted data inputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check -> print_version or print_info -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info; otherwise, it prints package details. It does not include any data processing, network communication, or external resource access. The structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs static package information and version details without interacting with external systems or handling untrusted input.",
