  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument '--version'",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info and version",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() outputs static info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static output, no external data, no obfuscation, no secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and outputs static package info or version. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
