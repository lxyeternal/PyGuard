{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, writing package info and version data to stdout.",
  "sinks": "stdout.write() for outputting information; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) -> conditional logic -> stdout.write() outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code strictly outputs static package info and version details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for handling command-line arguments and output. The print_info() and print_version() functions output static package-related information to stdout. The main() function processes '--version' argument to display version info; otherwise, it displays package info. The logic is straightforward, with no input sanitization concerns, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard CLI script for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI entry point that outputs static package and version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely by printing predefined strings based on command-line input.",
