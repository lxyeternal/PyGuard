{
  "purpose": "Provides CLI entrypoint to display package info and version information for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; reads from sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers print_version or print_info functions, which write static text to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code. No external network requests, file access, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing a CLI tool that displays static package information or version number based on user input. It only interacts with stdout and command-line arguments. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscation or unusual coding patterns detected. The purpose appears solely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk.",
