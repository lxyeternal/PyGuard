  "purpose": "Provide CLI output with package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments -> print functions -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple functions for printing static package info and version to stdout, controlled by command-line argument '--version'. The main function directs flow based on argument presence. No external data sources, no user input processing beyond sys.argv, and no sensitive information handling or network operations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI entry point with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
