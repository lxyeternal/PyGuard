  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Simple CLI script\n- Prints static package info or version\n- Checks for '--version' argument\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  All reports assign malware score 0, which is accurate given the code's content.\n\n- **Obfuscated?**  \n  All reports assign obfuscated 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Security risk?**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- **Reports' reasoning?**  \n  They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behaviors. This is correct.\n\n- **Any overestimations?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, security risk?**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score?**  \n  All are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume static output and command-line argument handling pose no security risk, which is correct.\n\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that isn't present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications needed. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.",
