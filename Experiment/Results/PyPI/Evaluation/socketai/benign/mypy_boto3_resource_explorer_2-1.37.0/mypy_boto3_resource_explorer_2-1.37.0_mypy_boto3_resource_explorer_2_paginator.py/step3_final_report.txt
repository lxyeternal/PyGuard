  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 resource-explorer-2 paginators, facilitating static type checking and SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, method parameters (**kwargs), imported type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, network calls, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Method 'paginate' accepts typed kwargs, which are used solely within class methods without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class inheritance and method definitions for boto3 paginators, primarily serving as static type annotations. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and imports detailed type definitions. There is no runtime logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for SDK stub files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for static type checking, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores reflecting the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
