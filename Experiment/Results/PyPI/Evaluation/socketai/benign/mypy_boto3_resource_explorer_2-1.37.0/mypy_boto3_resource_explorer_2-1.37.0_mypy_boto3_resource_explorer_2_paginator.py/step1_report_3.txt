  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the resource-explorer-2 service client, enabling type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods for pagination; no external or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data is processed or outputted directly, and no network or file I/O appears to be triggered.",
  "flows": "The paginator classes define flow control for iterating over paginated API responses but do not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward, focusing on type annotations and class inheritance. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations for a boto3 service client. It imports necessary modules, defines classes with paginate methods, and uses conditional type imports for compatibility. No runtime code execution, external input processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper code for type safety, with no malicious or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of type-annotated paginator classes for boto3 resource-explorer-2. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It solely provides type definitions and pagination interface enhancements.",
