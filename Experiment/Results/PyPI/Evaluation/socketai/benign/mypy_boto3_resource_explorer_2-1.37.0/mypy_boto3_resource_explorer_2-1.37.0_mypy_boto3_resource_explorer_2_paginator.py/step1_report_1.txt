{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the resource-explorer-2 service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (**kwargs) in the paginate methods, imported type definitions, and system version checks.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input within this code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling paginate methods with parameters, which utilize type definitions and system version info; no external data processing or transfer is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily type annotations with class definitions; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a type definition module for boto3 paginator classes with no runtime data processing, external data handling, or suspicious operations. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, and defines classes with paginate methods annotated for type checking. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a well-structured, benign type annotation and class inheritance setup for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 resource-explorer-2 paginators, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
