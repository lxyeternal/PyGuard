  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS Resource Explorer 2 service, facilitating type-checked interactions with the AWS API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and method implementations including paginators and API operations.",
  "sinks": "Methods that potentially send or receive data: generate_presigned_url, associate_default_view, batch_get_view, create_index, create_view, delete_index, delete_view, disassociate_default_view, get_account_level_service_configuration, get_default_view, get_index, get_managed_view, get_view, list_indexes, list_indexes_for_members, list_managed_views, list_resources, list_supported_resource_types, list_tags_for_resource, list_views, search, tag_resource, untag_resource, update_index_type, update_view, get_paginator.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into methods; some methods, such as generate_presigned_url, may generate URLs for untrusted data; tag and untag resource methods modify resource tags; get methods retrieve data; list and search methods retrieve resource info; paginator methods handle paginated data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and client class definition with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports are evident. The code relies on standard AWS SDK conventions and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Resource Explorer 2, including properties, method signatures with detailed type annotations, and overloads for paginator creation. It imports standard libraries, AWS SDK modules, and internal type definitions. The methods are consistent with AWS SDK patterns, with no dynamic code execution, hidden logic, or suspicious behaviors. The presence of docstrings with URLs suggests documentation adherence rather than malicious intent. No malicious code or supply chain attack vectors are apparent. The structure is typical for a generated or hand-written SDK stub file meant for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious type annotation and client class definition for AWS Resource Explorer 2 SDK. It serves as a type-safe interface to AWS API calls without any signs of malware or security risks.",
