  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 resource-explorer-2 service, enabling type-checked interactions with the AWS Resource Explorer API.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters, especially **kwargs unpacked from type definitions, which are used in API calls; no direct untrusted input handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Unpacking of input type definitions into method parameters for API requests; no external or untrusted data flow detected outside API invocation contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. Usage of dynamic typing with Unpack and overloads is standard for boto3 stubs. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations, class definitions, property, and method signatures for AWS Resource Explorer client, utilizing boto3 and botocore libraries. No actual data processing, external data handling, or network operations are present within this module. All method implementations are placeholders or documentation references, with no malicious payload or behavior. The unpacking of type definitions for API calls is standard practice. No anomalous behavior, malicious patterns, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-stub module for the AWS Resource Explorer boto3 client, providing type hints for IDE support and static analysis. It contains no executable or malicious code, no suspicious data flows, and adheres to expected patterns for AWS SDK stubs. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
