  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a type stub module for the boto3 Resource Explorer client, mainly imports and class/method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows outside API calls; no untrusted input handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is a standard stub for static analysis.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware and obfuscated scores are 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining a client class with detailed type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods involve API calls, URL generation, resource tagging—standard SDK patterns.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation; standard SDK stub code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (1), malware and obfuscated scores are 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK stub with detailed method signatures and type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** API invocation methods, URL generation, resource tagging—standard SDK functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code; use of generate_presigned_url is typical for SDKs.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, small security risk (0.1) possibly due to URL generation, but still standard.  \n**Assessment:** No malicious issues, just a minor security concern typical for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK stub with detailed method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, URL generation, resource modifications—standard patterns.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, small security risk (0.1).  \n**Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK stub, similar pattern.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** API methods, resource tagging, URL generation—normal SDK functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (1), malware and obfuscated scores are 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports describe legitimate, standard SDK stub code for AWS Resource Explorer.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Minor security risk scores (0.1) are due to URL generation, which is typical for SDKs, not malicious.\n- All code is purely type annotations and method signatures, with no executable or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (SDK stubs), the risk is minimal; I would set it at 0 or very close to it.\n\n### Overall:\nThe code is a standard, safe SDK stub module for AWS Resource Explorer, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
