{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS Resource Explorer v2 SDK, providing structured interfaces for API operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party modules (botocore), and local modules for type definitions and paginators.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate URLs, perform API calls, or modify resources, such as generate_presigned_url, associate_default_view, create_index, delete_view, tag_resource, untag_resource, update_index_type, update_view.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to methods (e.g., via **kwargs unpacked from type defs) flow into API calls or URL generation; methods like generate_presigned_url and tag_resource send data over the network or modify resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK interface with no hidden behavior or obfuscated code. The use of generate_presigned_url with user-supplied parameters could be a minor concern but is standard for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Resource Explorer v2 with comprehensive type annotations and method definitions. It uses standard AWS SDK patterns, including paginators, exception handling, URL generation, and resource tagging. The class methods accept parameters unpacked from type definitions, and there are overloads for paginators. No malicious code, such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or system modification routines, is present. The code is purely interface and type annotation, serving as a structured SDK wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a type-safe SDK interface for AWS Resource Explorer v2 with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard patterns, and all network-related functions are typical for SDKs. No malware or security risks are detected.",
