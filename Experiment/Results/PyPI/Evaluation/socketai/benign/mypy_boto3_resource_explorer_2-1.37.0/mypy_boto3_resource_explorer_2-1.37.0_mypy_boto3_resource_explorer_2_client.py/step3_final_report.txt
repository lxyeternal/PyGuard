{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 resource-explorer-2 client, serving as static type hints for IDEs and type checkers.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type definitions, and property declarations within the SDK stub module; no untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "API call signatures, URL generation, resource tagging, and resource retrieval functions; standard SDK operations.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpack type definitions for API calls; no data flows outside standard SDK patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; the code is a straightforward SDK stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type stub module providing method signatures and type annotations for the AWS Resource Explorer 2 client. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network operations beyond standard SDK patterns. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The use of methods like generate_presigned_url and resource modification functions is typical for SDK interfaces and does not indicate malicious intent. The high confidence score (0.95) reflects the clarity and standard nature of the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.0 to 0.1), justified by the inherent capabilities of SDK functions but not indicative of actual threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK stub module for AWS Resource Explorer 2, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, interface-only nature.",
