{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS Resource Explorer v2 service, enabling type checking and IDE support for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class definitions; method signatures with type annotations; property definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling AWS APIs via boto3, with parameters and return types; no apparent sinks handling untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (unpacked kwargs) flow into AWS API calls; no explicit data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual logic; code primarily consists of type annotations and method signatures aligned with boto3 patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-safe client wrapper for AWS Resource Explorer, including exception types, client properties, and methods corresponding to AWS API operations. It uses type annotations and overloads to improve type checking. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data handling is present. The structure adheres to standard boto3 stub generation practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured AWS SDK stub definition with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain threats. It is purely for type annotations and documentation support.",
