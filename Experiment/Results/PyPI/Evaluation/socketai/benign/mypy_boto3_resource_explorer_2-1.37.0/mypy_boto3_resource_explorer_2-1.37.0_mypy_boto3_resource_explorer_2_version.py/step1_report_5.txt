  "purpose": "Define and store the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) which is inconsistent or potentially placeholder; no malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string for the module/package and includes a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The future copyright year might be an inconsistency, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual copyright year is likely an oversight or placeholder, not malicious.",
