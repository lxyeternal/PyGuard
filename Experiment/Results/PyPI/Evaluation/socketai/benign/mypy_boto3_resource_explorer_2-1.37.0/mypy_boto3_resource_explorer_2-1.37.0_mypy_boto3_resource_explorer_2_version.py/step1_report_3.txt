  "purpose": "Defines the version of a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow beyond assigning a static string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) might be suspicious if code is from the past, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string to __version__ and contains a copyright comment. No input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The license comment and version string are typical for package metadata. The future copyright year does not affect security but is unusual for a code file from a past date.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with a copyright comment; it contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
