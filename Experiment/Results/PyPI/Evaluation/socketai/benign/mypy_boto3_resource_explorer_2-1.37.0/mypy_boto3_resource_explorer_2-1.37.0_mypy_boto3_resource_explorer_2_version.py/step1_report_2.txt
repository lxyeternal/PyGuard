  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "The static assignment of __version__ does not involve data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward version declaration with a copyright comment",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment block indicating the source of truth for versioning and a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious code. It appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
