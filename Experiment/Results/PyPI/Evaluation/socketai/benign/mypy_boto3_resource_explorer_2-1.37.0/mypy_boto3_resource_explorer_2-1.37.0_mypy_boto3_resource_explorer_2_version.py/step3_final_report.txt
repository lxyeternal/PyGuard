  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"; the comment block with copyright info.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment is self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which may be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a copyright comment. No dynamic code, input, external dependencies, or suspicious behavior are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code is typical for package versioning and contains no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor future year comment is likely a placeholder. The existing reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
