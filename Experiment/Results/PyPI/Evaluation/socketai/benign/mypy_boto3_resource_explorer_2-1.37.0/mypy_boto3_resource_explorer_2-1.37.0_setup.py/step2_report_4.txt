  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, external commands, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code reads a local README file for the long description, uses static metadata, and calls `setup()` from setuptools.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, a confidence of 1, and a security risk of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware risk:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n- **Logic or reasoning flaws:** None; the reports correctly identify the script as a standard setup configuration.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- The overall risk scores are 0.5 or below, which is appropriate for non-malicious, static configuration scripts.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code present.  \n- No external or untrusted data sources involved.  \n- Static, well-understood package configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current static code, there is no security concern.",
