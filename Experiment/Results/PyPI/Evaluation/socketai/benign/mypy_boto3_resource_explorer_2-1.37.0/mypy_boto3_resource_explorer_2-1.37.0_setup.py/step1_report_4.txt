  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-resource-explorer-2 package with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable usage beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for file reading, loads the README content, and calls setup() with static parameters. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The dependencies and metadata are standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code insertion. The structure and content follow typical Python package setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs static package configuration and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
