{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the Python library 'mypy-boto3-resource-explorer-2'.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description, imports 'setuptools' for packaging, and defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted input, external commands, or outputs sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> processes static package metadata -> calls setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' and 'setuptools', reads a local README file, and invokes 'setup()' with static metadata. No user input or external data is processed or output. The install_requires field includes a version-specific dependency, which is standard. No malicious patterns such as code execution, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it is safe and standard.",
