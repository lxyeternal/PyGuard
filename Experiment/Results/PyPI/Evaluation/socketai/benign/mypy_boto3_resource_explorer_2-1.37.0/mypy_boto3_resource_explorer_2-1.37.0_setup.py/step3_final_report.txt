{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and reading a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the local README.md file, static strings for package metadata, and calling setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used throughout, no external or user input involved.",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static data to setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. No external data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code follows best practices for package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, and confidence is high. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
