  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS resource and service identifiers used in boto3 stubs for type hinting.",
  "sources": "Read-only definitions of string literals assigned to variables, imported modules sys and typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly contains type annotations, conditional imports, and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS resource identifiers using Python's Literal type, with conditional import based on Python version. No input handling, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution observed. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code; the structure and content are straightforward type alias definitions for static use. The only conditional import adapts to Python versions, which is standard practice. The module is designed purely for type safety and documentation support, with no runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS resource and service identifiers, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is intended for static type checking and documentation purposes only.",
