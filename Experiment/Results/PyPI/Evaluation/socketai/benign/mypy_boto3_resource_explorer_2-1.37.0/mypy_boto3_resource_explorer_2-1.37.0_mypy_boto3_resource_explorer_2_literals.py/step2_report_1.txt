  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or potential security concerns.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static, declarative module defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers.\n- No dynamic data handling, user input, network activity, or runtime code execution is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, purely defining types, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Static definitions, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, static type definitions, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Static type annotations, no runtime logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type definitions, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static and safe.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.\n- The use of conditional import for `Literal` is standard practice for compatibility, not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. No obfuscation or suspicious complexity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\nGiven the consistent findings, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a safe, standard type definition module for AWS SDKs.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- No changes needed.\n- No further security concerns are warranted based on this code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a straightforward static type annotation utility for AWS resource identifiers.",
