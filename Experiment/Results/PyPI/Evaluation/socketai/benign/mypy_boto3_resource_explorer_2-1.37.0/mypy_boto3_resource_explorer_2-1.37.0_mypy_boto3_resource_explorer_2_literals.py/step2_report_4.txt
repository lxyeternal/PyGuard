  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the consistency of scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward type annotation module defining string literals for AWS resource types, with no dynamic or executable code. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious behavior. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate. Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static definitions, conditional import for compatibility, and no data flow or external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious or malicious patterns. The scores are reasonable, and the conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code consists of static string literals, conditional import, and type aliases for AWS resource identifiers. No runtime logic or external interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and purely for static type annotations. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static definitions, conditional import, no data flow, no external data, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. The code is a standard type definition module, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Identical to previous reports—type annotations, static literals, conditional import, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or executable logic. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:** Since the code is just static type annotations and constants, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n\n- **Potential for Malicious Activity:** None detected. The code contains no network activity, file I/O, dynamic execution, or secret data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (benign, purely static type definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately assess the code as safe and non-malicious. No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe module defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers. It serves static type checking purposes only, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
