  "purpose": "Define type annotations for resource-explorer-2 service literal definitions to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, and the assignment of various Literal types to constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code is purely defining constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; no dynamic data handling or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. The code strictly defines constants and type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of string literal types for type annotations, with a conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It includes comprehensive definitions of various string literal types, constants, and a descriptive comment block. There are no functions, input handling, external data processing, or executable code that could pose security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely declarative, serving as type annotations for AWS resource types. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It is a standard, safe type definition module.",
