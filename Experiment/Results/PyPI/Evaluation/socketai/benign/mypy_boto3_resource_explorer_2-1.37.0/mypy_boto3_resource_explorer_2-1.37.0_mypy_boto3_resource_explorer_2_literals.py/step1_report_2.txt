  "purpose": "Define type annotations and string literal types for resource explorer service literals and related identifiers for AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No user input, network data, or untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "None, as all definitions are static and no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type definitions and conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured for type annotations and documentation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The license comment and documentation link are informational and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type definitions module for AWS resource and service identifiers. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security risks detected. It serves its purpose as a type annotation helper with no evident security concerns.",
