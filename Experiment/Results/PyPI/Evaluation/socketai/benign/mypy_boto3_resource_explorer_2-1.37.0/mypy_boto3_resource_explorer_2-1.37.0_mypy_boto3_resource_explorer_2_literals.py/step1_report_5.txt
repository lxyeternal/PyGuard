  "purpose": "Define type annotations for resource-explorer-2 service literal definitions and related string literals for AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module for Python version check, and string literal definitions assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns string literals to variables; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. Use of conditional import for typing.Literal is standard for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS resource and service names, with conditional import for compatibility. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communication. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic detected. The code serves as a static typing aid, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign type annotation module for AWS resource identifiers, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility module for static type checking.",
