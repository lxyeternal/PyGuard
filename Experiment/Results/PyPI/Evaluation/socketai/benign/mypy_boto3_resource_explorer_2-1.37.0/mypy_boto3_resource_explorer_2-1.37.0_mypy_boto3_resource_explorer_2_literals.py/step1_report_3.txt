  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS resource explorer service literals and related string constants.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, and literal string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external network interaction present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as all data are static string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of static type definitions and imports with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing sys and conditionally importing Literal based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern. It then declares a series of Literal type aliases representing AWS resource types, service names, region names, and paginator names. The literals are static strings, used for type annotations, documentation, or validation. There are no functions, data inputs, or outputs, nor any dynamic or executable code. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated logic are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard type definition files for AWS SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type aliases for AWS resource identifiers, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to serve documentation and type safety purposes without any embedded malicious logic.",
