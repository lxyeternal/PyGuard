  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS resource and service literal definitions, serving as documentation and type safety aids.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals defining AWS resource, service, region, and paginator identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or runtime data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static definitions without data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS resources, services, regions, and paginator names. It includes conditional imports for Python version compatibility. No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or executable logic exists. The code serves as a static type annotation utility, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as a type annotation module for AWS SDKs. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
