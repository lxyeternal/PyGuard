  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, overestimations, or overlooked risks.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely defining string literal types and constants for type annotations.\n- No dynamic data handling, input/output, or external network activity.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard compatibility practice.\n- The content is static, well-structured, and serves documentation and type safety purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code is benign, purely declarative, with no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & malware scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Also correctly notes the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as static type annotations with no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code's nature—static, declarative, and documentation-oriented.\n\n**Are there any overlooked issues?**  \nNo. The code does not execute any logic, handle external data, or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with all the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: a straightforward, safe type definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
