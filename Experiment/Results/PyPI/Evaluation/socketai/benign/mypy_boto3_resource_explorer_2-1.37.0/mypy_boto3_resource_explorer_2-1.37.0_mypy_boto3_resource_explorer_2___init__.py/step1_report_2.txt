{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for resource-explorer-2 service, defining imports and exposing classes and types for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator), reading documentation string, module-level variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data handling, input/output, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments do not process untrusted data or pass data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly serves as an interface module, importing classes and functions, setting an alias, and defining exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The documentation string provides usage instructions but does not include any code that could execute or exfiltrate data. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for Python package interface modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical interface setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not read untrusted input, perform dangerous operations, or communicate externally. Overall, it appears safe.",
