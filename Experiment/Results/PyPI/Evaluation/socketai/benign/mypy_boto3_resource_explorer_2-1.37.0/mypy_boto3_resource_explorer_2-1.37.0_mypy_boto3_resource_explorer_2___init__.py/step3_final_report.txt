{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python interface module for AWS resource-explorer-2 service, exposing classes and paginators for resource management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), documentation strings with usage examples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definitions, with documentation serving as usage guidance; no runtime data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, sets an alias, and defines __all__ for exports. The documentation provides usage examples but contains no executable code beyond documentation. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing involving untrusted inputs. The structure is standard for an API wrapper, with no obfuscation or secrets. All security signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module for AWS resource exploration, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk are appropriately zero, aligning with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
