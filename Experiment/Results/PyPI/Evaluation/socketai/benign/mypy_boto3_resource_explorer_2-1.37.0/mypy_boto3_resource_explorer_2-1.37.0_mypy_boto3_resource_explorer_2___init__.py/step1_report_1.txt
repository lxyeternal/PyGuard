{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface and imports for resource-explorer-2 service, primarily to facilitate interaction with AWS resource explorer features.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), and the embedded documentation string that includes sample usage and description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines imports, class alias, and module exports without processing or executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class references and imports that would be used elsewhere; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code. The documentation string contains sample code but no indications of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level import statements, documentation, and alias assignments. It imports classes from internal modules and assigns a class to a variable for external use. The documentation includes sample usage code for interacting with AWS resources. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling that could introduce security concerns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward interface layer for the resource-explorer-2 service, with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe and intended for use as a library or API wrapper.",
