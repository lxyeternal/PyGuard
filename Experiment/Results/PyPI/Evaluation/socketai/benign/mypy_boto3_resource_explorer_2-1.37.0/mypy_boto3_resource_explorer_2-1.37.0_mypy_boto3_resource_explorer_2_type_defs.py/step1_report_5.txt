{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for resource-explorer-2 service interactions in boto3, aiding static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party typing extensions, and module-internal literals; no external input sources or dynamic data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines types and does not perform data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; the code is purely type definitions without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises type annotations using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes no runtime logic, external data handling, or network interactions. All imports are standard or from well-known type libraries, with no dynamic execution or string evaluations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code's purpose is purely to define data structures for a boto3 service client, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for a boto3 service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static typing aid for development and does not process or transmit data at runtime.",
