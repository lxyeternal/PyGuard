  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the validity of their claims, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is for type annotations and data structures for resource-explorer-2, with no runtime logic or untrusted data sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The code is static, with conditional imports for Python compatibility, no dynamic execution, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The reviewer concludes benign intent with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is accurate. The code is a straightforward static type definition file, with no malicious behavior or security issues.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes static type definitions, no external data, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected. The code remains purely static type annotations.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, static definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a benign static type definition file.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type annotations, no external data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; static, safe code.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, no runtime logic or external data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll five reports agree that the code is benign static type definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for a Python SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided. No further action needed.",
