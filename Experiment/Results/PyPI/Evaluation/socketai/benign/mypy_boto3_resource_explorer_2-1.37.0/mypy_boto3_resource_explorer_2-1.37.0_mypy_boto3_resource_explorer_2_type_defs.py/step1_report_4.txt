  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for resource-explorer-2 service interactions, enabling static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reading of imported modules, system version info, and static type annotations within class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely static type definitions with no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python type annotations, class definitions, and structured data schemas using TypedDict. It imports standard libraries and conditional imports for compatibility. No code executes logic or handles external data; all data structures are static and well-defined. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The licensing and documentation comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of static type definitions for a Python SDK or interface, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is purely for type safety and code clarity in client interactions with the resource-explorer-2 service.",
