  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the nature of static type definitions, and the provided evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of Python `TypedDict` and class definitions for the resource-explorer-2 service.\n- It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The license, author info, and documentation links are benign and typical for open-source SDKs.\n- The purpose is solely to define data structures for type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines type annotations for SDK interactions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; purely static type definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, static data structure definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime or external data handling; purely declarative.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard static typing code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; purely static type annotations.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Benign and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Static type definitions for SDK.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for type safety.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for boto3 SDK.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None identified; no external data handling, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor note is the use of conditional imports for compatibility, which is a common practice and not suspicious.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is an open-source SDK type definition module, with no runtime or external data processing.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' assessments are aligned with the actual content.\n\n---\n\n### **My Own Final Scores & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for a Python SDK. It does not perform any operations, handle external data at runtime, or include any suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The static nature and purpose of the code confirm its safety.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
