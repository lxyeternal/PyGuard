{
  "purpose": "Defines static Python type annotations and data schemas for resource-explorer-2 SDK, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, type definitions, class and TypedDict declarations, no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static data structure definitions with no runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; static type annotations without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; conditional imports are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict and classes, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There is no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for SDK type annotations, and no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static type annotations for the resource-explorer-2 SDK. All evidence indicates it is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
