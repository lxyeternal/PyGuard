{
  "purpose": "Defines Python type annotations and data structures for resource-explorer-2 service interactions, mainly for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads are primarily from imported modules, the __future__ import, and standard library modules (sys, datetime, typing). No user input or untrusted data sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, execute code, or perform network operations are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code strictly defines type structures without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes some unused imports and conditional type imports based on Python version, which are standard practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are observed. The license and author info are benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of TypedDict definitions for a Python SDK. It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks. The structure is typical for API type definitions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are detected. The only potential concern is the use of deprecated typing extension imports, which is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
