  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the resource-explorer-2 service, used for data validation and type safety in boto3 SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, class and variable declarations, imported modules, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; code mostly consists of data type definitions and annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present; the code defines static types and data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is purely type definition and documentation. The presence of a copyright statement and documentation links does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of Python type annotations using TypedDict and related constructs for defining data structures used in the resource-explorer-2 service. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version and does not include any executable logic, network operations, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external data handling are present. The only noteworthy aspect is a copyright notice and a link to documentation, which are standard for open-source SDK or API client libraries. There is no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior in the static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions and documentation for the resource-explorer-2 service. It contains no executable code, no data transmission, or any suspicious activity. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The code appears to be safe and standard for SDK type hinting and data validation.",
