{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and data structures for resource-explorer-2 service interactions in Python, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, imports, and constants; no runtime input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or execution points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; this is purely type annotation code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides TypedDict and class definitions to facilitate static type checking of the resource explorer service's data structures. It imports standard libraries and type extension modules for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or external inputs are present. The code appears to be purely declarative, defining data schemas without any side effects or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python SDK or library. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely intended for type checking.",
