  "purpose": "XML serialization of Python data structures for Django REST Framework",
  "sources": "Data structures (dicts, lists, primitives) processed in _to_xml method",
  "sinks": "Characters output via xml.characters, start/endElement calls",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data through _to_xml to xml.characters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard XML renderer that serializes data into XML format. It uses safe, well-known libraries without external resource access or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The data flow is simple and contained within the method, with no external interactions. The code handles data safely, with no signs of injection or malicious payloads. The use of force_str ensures proper string conversion, and the overall structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions as intended for data serialization without exposing security risks.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
