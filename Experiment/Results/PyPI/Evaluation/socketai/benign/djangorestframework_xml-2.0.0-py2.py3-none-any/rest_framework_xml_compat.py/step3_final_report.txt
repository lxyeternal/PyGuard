  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import defusedxml.ElementTree for secure XML parsing, falling back to None if unavailable. It is a straightforward, standard pattern for optional dependencies, with no data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The use of defusedxml indicates security awareness, not malicious intent. The code is simple, clear, and serves a compatibility purpose. No anomalies or malicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for compatibility, and employs secure practices. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and should remain at 0. There are no indications of malicious activity or security issues.",
