  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic involved. The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity. Since all reports agree, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any potential security risk, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The code is a straightforward version string assignment, which inherently carries no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All assessments are based on the actual code snippet, which is just a static assignment. No assumptions are made beyond what is visible.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this code snippet, I concur with the provided assessments. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**",
