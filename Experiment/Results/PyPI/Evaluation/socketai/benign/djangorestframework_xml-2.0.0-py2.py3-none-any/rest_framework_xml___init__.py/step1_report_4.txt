  "anomalies": "Code only sets a version string without any additional logic or suspicious constructs; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code merely assigns a string to a variable __version__, which is a common practice for versioning in Python packages. There are no input sources, no processing, and no data sinks. The simplicity suggests it is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
