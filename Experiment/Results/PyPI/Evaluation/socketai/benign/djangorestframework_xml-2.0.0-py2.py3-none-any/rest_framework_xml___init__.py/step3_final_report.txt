  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no threat and is typical in Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the harmless nature of the code.",
