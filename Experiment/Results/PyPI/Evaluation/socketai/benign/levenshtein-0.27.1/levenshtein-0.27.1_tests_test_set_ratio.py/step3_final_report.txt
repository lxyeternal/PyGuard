  "purpose": "A simple test script demonstrating the use of Levenshtein.setratio() with static string lists and asserting the expected similarity ratio.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string lists within the test_documented() function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external inputs",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed internally by Levenshtein.setratio(), with no external data flow or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Levenshtein library, defines a floating-point comparison function, and runs a test asserting the similarity ratio between two static string lists. No external input, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The use of the library and the test pattern are standard. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test case with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
