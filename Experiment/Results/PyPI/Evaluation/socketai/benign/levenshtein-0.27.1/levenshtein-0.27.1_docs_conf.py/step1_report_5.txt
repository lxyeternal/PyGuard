  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, extensions, themes, and paths.",
  "sources": "Import statements, extension list, path configurations, theme settings, and static file paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure path insertions or modifications, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are not evident here.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard configuration with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file with imports, project info, extension settings, and static paths. It imports 'annotations' from '__future__' but does not execute any dynamic code or handle untrusted input. No sensitive data, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The structure and content are consistent with standard documentation setup, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
