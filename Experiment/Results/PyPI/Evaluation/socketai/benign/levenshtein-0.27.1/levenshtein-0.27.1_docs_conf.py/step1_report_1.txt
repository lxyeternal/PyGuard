  "sources": "Import statements, extension list, project metadata, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of standard configuration options with no suspicious code or dynamic execution; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with standard Python syntax. It imports future annotations, defines project info, sets up extensions, paths, and theme options, and configures some extensions. All elements are consistent with standard documentation setup scripts. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
