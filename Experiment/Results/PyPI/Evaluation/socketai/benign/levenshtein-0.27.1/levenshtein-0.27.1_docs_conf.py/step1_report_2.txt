  "purpose": "Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, extensions, themes, and paths.",
  "sources": "Imports (__future__.annotations), configuration variables, and list assignments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration setup is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file with standard syntax. It includes an import statement for __future__.annotations, which is normal for future-proofing type annotations, and sets project details, extensions, paths, and theme options. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or data handling that could suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical, well-formed setup script without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and safe setup file.",
