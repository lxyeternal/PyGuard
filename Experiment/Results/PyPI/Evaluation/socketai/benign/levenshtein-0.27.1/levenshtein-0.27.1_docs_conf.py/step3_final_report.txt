  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, extensions, paths, and theme.",
  "sources": "Import statement (__future__.annotations), project metadata, extension list, path configurations, theme settings, extension options.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard, straightforward configuration code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, containing only import statements, project info, extension lists, path settings, and theme options. No dynamic execution, external network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The import of __future__.annotations is a common practice for forward compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with typical configuration practices. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
