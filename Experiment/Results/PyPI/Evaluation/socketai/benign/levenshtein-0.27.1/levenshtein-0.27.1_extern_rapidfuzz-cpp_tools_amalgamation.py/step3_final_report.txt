{
  "purpose": "This script concatenates multiple C++ header files into a single header, avoiding duplicate includes and skipping license comments, to facilitate easier distribution or integration.",
  "sources": "Reads header files from specified paths, parses include directives, and skips license/copyright lines.",
  "sinks": "External call to 'clang-format' for formatting the output header file.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> processes lines (skipping certain lines, handling includes) -> writes to output file -> invokes 'clang-format' on the output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file concatenation with include management, license skipping, and formatting. It uses regex for include parsing, manages included headers to prevent duplication, and calls an external formatting tool. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The subprocess call to 'clang-format' is standard and safe. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for C++ header amalgamation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
