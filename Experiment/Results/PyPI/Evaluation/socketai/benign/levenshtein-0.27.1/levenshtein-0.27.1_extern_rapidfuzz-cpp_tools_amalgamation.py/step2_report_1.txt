  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a script that concatenates C++ header files into a single header file, avoiding duplicate includes and handling copyright/license lines.\n- It invokes 'clang-format' via subprocess to format the output.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose in build automation.\n- The only external operation is formatting, which is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The script is straightforward, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms the script's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis notes that invoking 'clang-format' is benign, and no malicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; the script is a build utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is transparent, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) due to external subprocess call, but this is standard for formatting tools.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to external process invocation, which is common in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a legitimate build utility with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-understood, and the scores are justified.
