  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code consists of three test functions for the Levenshtein distance implementation.\n   - The tests cover:\n     - Empty strings\n     - Simple string comparisons with bytes and unicode\n     - Unicode-specific cases\n   - The code appears correct and straightforward, with no obvious vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n2. **Report Content:**\n   - All five reports are empty responses, providing no additional details, analysis, or findings.\n   - No indications of vulnerabilities, malware, obfuscation, or other issues are present in these reports.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks and Scores:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or code flaws.\n   - The code itself is simple and appears safe.\n   - The absence of details prevents any high risk or malware scoring.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code shown is a test suite for a Levenshtein distance function, which is a common utility.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious imports (Levenshtein library is standard for such tasks), or malicious patterns are visible.\n   - The report does not mention any issues, so the malware score should be minimal or zero.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - Since no information is provided beyond empty responses, the most reasonable scores are:\n     - Malware score: 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n     - Obfuscated score: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n     - Risk score: 0 (no identified vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is safe, and the reports contain no findings or evidence of issues.\n- The scores should reflect the absence of risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the provided data and the absence of any report details.",
