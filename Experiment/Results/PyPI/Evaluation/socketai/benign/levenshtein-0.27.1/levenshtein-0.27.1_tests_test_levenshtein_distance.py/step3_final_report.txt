{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for the Levenshtein distance implementation, verifying behavior with empty strings, simple strings, and unicode characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from string and byte literals within test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The data flows are limited to internal function calls within the test functions; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, well-structured test functions for the Levenshtein library, covering empty, simple, and unicode strings. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The reports provided are empty, containing no analysis or findings, which suggests either a reporting failure or no issues detected. Given the code's benign nature and the lack of any suspicious signals, the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard test code for a string distance library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
