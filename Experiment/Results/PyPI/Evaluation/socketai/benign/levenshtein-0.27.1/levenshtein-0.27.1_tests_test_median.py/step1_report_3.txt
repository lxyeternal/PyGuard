{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for the Levenshtein module, focusing on string similarity and median calculations.",
  "sources": "Code reads string lists and function parameters for median and quickmedian calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external connections; tests operate on predefined data.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through Levenshtein functions, but only within the scope of the module; no external data flow or output transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard test assertions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for the Levenshtein module, invoking functions to verify string median calculations. It uses fixed input data and does not include any network calls, file I/O, or environment variable use. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The structure and content are typical for unit tests, with no obfuscated or hidden code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script for the Levenshtein module, with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard unit testing functions on string similarity algorithms.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
