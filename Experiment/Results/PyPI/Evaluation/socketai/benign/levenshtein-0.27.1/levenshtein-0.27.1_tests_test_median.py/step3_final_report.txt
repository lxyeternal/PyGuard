{
  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying the behavior of the Levenshtein library functions for string median calculations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string lists within test functions, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static test assertions without data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions asserting expected outputs for the Levenshtein library. It uses static, hardcoded data with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions are standard and clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No issues or risks are evident, and the code appears to be a safe, typical test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test code for the Levenshtein library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
