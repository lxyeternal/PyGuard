{
  "purpose": "The code provides test functions for the Levenshtein module, specifically testing string median calculations and related functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads string inputs from predefined test cases within the functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not process external or user inputs or write data to untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; all data is static within the test functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward test code with no obfuscated elements, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. No unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'Levenshtein' and runs a series of assertions to verify its functions. The test functions contain only static strings and lists, with no dynamic or external data sources. There are no network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling. The structure is standard for test scripts, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of unit tests for the Levenshtein string matching library. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any harmful actions.",
