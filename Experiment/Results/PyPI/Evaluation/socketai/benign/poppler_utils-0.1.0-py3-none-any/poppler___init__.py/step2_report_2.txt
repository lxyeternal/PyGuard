  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .__version__ import __version__`.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this minimal import.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input, or data processing.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as minimal, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1.0`\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - Since the code is a simple import statement with no suspicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - The malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the import statement as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, harmless import statement for version management. All reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:** Maintain the current scores and conclusions.",
