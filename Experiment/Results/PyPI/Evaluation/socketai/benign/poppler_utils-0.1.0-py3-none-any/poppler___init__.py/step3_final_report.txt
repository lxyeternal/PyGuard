{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module, serving to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from .__version__ import __version__` reads from a local module file `__version__`.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement for version management, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. It is a common pattern in Python packages. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and transparency support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
