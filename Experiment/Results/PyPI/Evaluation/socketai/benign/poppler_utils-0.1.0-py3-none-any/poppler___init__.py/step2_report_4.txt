  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple import statement for a `__version__` attribute from a local module.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical in Python packages.\n- No inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or data flows involving untrusted sources are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- The code snippets in all reports are consistent with the original code provided.\n- The code is a standard pattern for managing package versioning.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning; they all correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The conclusion that the code is safe and contains no malicious behavior is justified.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable given the code.\n- Since the code is just an import statement with no suspicious activity, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent based solely on this import statement.\n- There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the uniformity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the provided scores.\n\n**However, to be thorough, if I were to assign scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the code's harmlessness and lack of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign import statement with no security issues. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
