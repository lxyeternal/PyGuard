{
  "purpose": "A numerical root-finding framework utilizing iterative solvers, designed to find zeros of user-defined functions within a scientific computing context.",
  "sources": "Inputs from user-provided function 'fn', initial guess 'y0', and solver attributes; data flows through solver steps and function evaluations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'fn', which could be malicious if user-supplied; no system calls, network operations, or file manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initial guess and arguments into 'fn', then through solver iterations, with results checked against convergence criteria.",
  "anomalies": "Environment-dependent adjustment of '_rewrite_fn' based on module name, which is a benign workaround; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard numerical root-finding routines with well-defined data flows and no embedded malicious logic. The primary security concern is executing user-supplied 'fn', which is inherent to such frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent within the code itself. External dependencies are standard, and no network or file operations are performed. The workaround for '_rewrite_fn' is environment-specific and benign. The code's clarity and structure do not suggest obfuscation or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent root-finding utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only potential security risk stems from the execution of untrusted user functions, which is expected in such APIs. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of executing user-defined functions. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
