  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code functionality, potential malicious behavior, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a root-finding framework with no malicious intent. It relies on external libraries, performs standard numerical operations, and does not execute untrusted data or system commands.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — a slight concern due to potential execution of user-supplied `fn`.  \n- **Justification:** Since `fn` is user-defined and could be malicious, the risk is inherent but not due to code itself.  \n- **Overall:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard numerical solver with no malicious code, but with a minor workaround for `_rewrite_fn`.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external or system operations.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; the environment-dependent code is benign.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights that `fn` is user-defined, which could be malicious, but the framework itself is standard.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — same reasoning as above, the risk stems from user code, not the framework.  \n- **Justification:** The code executes user-provided functions; potential for malicious `fn`, but the code itself is safe.  \n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on the same points—standard root-finding framework, potential risk from `fn`, no malicious code embedded.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns well.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Justification:** The main security concern is executing untrusted `fn`, which is inherent to such APIs.  \n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar, noting the environment-dependent adjustment of `_rewrite_fn`, but no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external or system operations.  \n- **Justification:** The environment check is benign; no malicious intent.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment\n\n- **Code presence of malicious code:** No.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Mainly the execution of user-supplied `fn`, which is standard in scientific libraries but can be exploited if `fn` is malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.  \n- **Security risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to reliance on user-provided functions, which is standard but should be noted.\n\n### My Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reflects the inherent risk of executing untrusted user functions, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate numerical root-finding framework with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of the `fn` callback by an attacker, which is a common and accepted risk in such APIs.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
