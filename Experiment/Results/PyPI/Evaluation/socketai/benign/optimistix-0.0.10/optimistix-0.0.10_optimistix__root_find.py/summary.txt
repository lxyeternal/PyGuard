  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent root-finding utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only potential security risk stems from the execution of untrusted user functions, which is expected in such APIs. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of executing user-defined functions. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured for its intended purpose."
