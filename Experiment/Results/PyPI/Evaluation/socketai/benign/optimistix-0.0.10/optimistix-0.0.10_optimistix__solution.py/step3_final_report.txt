{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for representing the results of a nonlinear solver, including extending error messages.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, static strings, type annotations, inheritance from external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from solver computations into class attributes; no external untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; extension of RESULTS with static messages is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions extending existing error message classes and a data container class for solver results. It relies on external libraries but does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The extension of RESULTS with static strings is a common pattern for error reporting. The Solution class is a straightforward data holder with no logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data structure for solver results with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
