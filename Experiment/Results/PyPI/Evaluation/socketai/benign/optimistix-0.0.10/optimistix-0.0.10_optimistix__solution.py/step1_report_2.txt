{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and extend error messages for a nonlinear solver solution representation.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`equinox`, `lineax`, `jaxtyping`) and the class definition that does not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. The extension of `RESULTS` class with additional messages is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several libraries, extending a `RESULTS` class with additional error messages and defining a `Solution` data class with attributes related to the solution of a nonlinear problem. The class attributes include data storage for solution values, results, auxiliary info, statistics, and internal state. There are no input parsing, network calls, or system modifications. The code structure is straightforward, mainly for data modeling. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure definition used in a scientific or mathematical context for nonlinear solving. It extends error messaging but does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and purely focused on data representation.",
