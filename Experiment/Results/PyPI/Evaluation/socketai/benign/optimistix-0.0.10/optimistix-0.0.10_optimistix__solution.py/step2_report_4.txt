  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code defines data structures related to nonlinear solver results, extending error messages, and encapsulating solution attributes.\n- No external input, network activity, or system commands are present.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`equinox`, `lineax`, `jaxtyping`) but only for data modeling and message extension.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily involving class inheritance, static strings, and data attribute definitions.\n\n**Assessment of Potential Risks:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, confirming code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Logical and Reasoning Checks:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign data container with no external data processing or security concerns.\n- The extension of `RESULTS` with additional messages is a common pattern for improving error reporting.\n- The class `Solution` is a typical pattern for encapsulating solver outputs, with no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- Given the absence of any suspicious activity, malicious behavior, or security flaws, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 (high) across all reports is justified due to the clear and consistent analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- No changes are necessary to the reported scores.\n- The code is safe, with no indications of supply chain security issues.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, transparent data structure definition for a nonlinear solver's output, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues. All scores are appropriate, and no further action is required.",
