  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any security concerns are warranted.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is primarily class definitions, extending error messages, and data containers for solver results.\n- No external input, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`equinox`, `lineax`, `jaxtyping`) but does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The extension of `RESULTS` with custom messages is benign.\n- The `Solution` class is a straightforward data container.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The extension of `RESULTS` with static strings is harmless.\n- The class definitions are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a benign, standard data structure setup for a nonlinear solver.\n- No malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present.\n- The extension of error messages is a common practice and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scoring. No further action needed.",
