{
  "purpose": "Define classes and extend existing results for a nonlinear solver solution representation, including custom result messages and data attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports of external libraries (equinox, lineax, jaxtyping), local module imports, class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network, file system, or environment variable access present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data appears to be used internally within class attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Class extensions and attribute annotations are standard. No suspicious or obfuscated code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an extension of an existing results class and a data container class representing a solution to a nonlinear problem. The extension of 'lx.RESULTS' adds descriptive error messages, which are static strings. The 'Solution' class contains attributes with type annotations, including user-defined types and generic parameters. There are no code execution, input handling, or network operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured data model with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure setup for representing solutions to nonlinear problems. It involves class inheritance, type annotations, and static string definitions, all standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks.",
