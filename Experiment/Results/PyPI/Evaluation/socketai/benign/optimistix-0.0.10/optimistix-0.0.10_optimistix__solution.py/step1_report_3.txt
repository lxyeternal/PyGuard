{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing solutions to nonlinear problems, including results, auxiliary data, and solver state.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or outputs; no output or external system interaction is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class definitions are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code uses external libraries (`equinox`, `lineax`) and defines error messages for solver results, which appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes and constants related to nonlinear solver results and solutions, with no dynamic input, network communication, or sensitive operations. The only notable aspect is the extension of an existing results class to include custom error messages, which is typical for error handling. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data classes for a solver, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger numerical library setup, with no suspicious elements.",
