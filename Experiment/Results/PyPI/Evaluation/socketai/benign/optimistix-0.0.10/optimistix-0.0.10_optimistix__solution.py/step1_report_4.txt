{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing the solution to a nonlinear solver, including result status, auxiliary data, statistics, and internal state.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (`typing`, `equinox`, `lineax`, `jaxtyping`, and local types from `._custom_types`).",
  "sinks": "None observed—no untrusted input, external data, or sensitive data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class simply defines data attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard class definition with descriptive docstring. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, defines a subclass of `lineax.RESULTS` to extend error messages, and declares a generic data class `Solution` with descriptive attributes for a nonlinear solver. The structure, naming, and content suggest typical, legitimate code for managing solver solutions. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific, with no external or untrusted data handling, insecure code practices, or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data structure definition for solver results. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
