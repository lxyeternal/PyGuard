{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing the solution to a nonlinear solver, including attributes for the solution value, result status, auxiliary data, statistics, and internal state.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`equinox`, `lineax`, `jaxtyping`) and the class attributes which include user-defined types and result messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or exported. No external I/O, network connections, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not process external input or output data; it mainly defines data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The class is a straightforward data container.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external libraries and defines a subclass of `lineax.RESULTS` with customized message strings. The main class `Solution` extends `eqx.Module` and is used to encapsulate the output of a solver, including attributes like `value`, `result`, `aux`, `stats`, and `state`. All attributes are data containers without any dynamic execution, input/output handling, or embedded code that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data structure definition for a nonlinear solver's output, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
