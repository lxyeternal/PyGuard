  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines data structures for representing the results of a nonlinear solver.\n- It extends an existing `RESULTS` class with additional error messages.\n- The main class `Solution` is a generic data container with attributes for solution value, result status, auxiliary data, statistics, and internal state.\n- All code elements are static, primarily involving class definitions, constants, and type annotations.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n- The extension of `RESULTS` with custom messages is benign.\n- The `Solution` class is a data container, with no logic that could be exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code appears to be well-structured and consistent with its purpose.\n- The only minor point is that the class `RESULTS` is extended with additional messages, but this is a common pattern and not problematic.\n\n**Verdict:** No errors or flaws detected.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The malware score is correctly at **0** because there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is **0**; the code is clear and readable.\n- The overall security risk is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that extending error messages or defining data classes is benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified here, as the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a standard, safe data structure definition with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured data container for nonlinear solver results, with no malicious or security risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
