The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0.1) due to the use of an internal module, which is acceptable given the context."

The only potential security risk stems from the execution of untrusted user functions, which is expected in such APIs. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of executing user-defined functions. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured for its intended purpose."
