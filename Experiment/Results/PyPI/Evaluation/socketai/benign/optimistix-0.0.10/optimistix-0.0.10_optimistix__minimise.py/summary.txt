  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a JAX-based minimization framework with no malicious intent or security concerns. The minor obfuscation in _rewrite_fn handling is justified as a compatibility measure. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.2, and security risk is low (~0.2)."
