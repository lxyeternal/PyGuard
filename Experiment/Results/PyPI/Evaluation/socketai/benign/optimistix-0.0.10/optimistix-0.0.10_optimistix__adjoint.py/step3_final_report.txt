{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for adjoint methods, checkpointing, and implicit function theorem-based backpropagation in scientific autodiff frameworks.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (`primal_fn`, `rewrite_fn`, `inputs`), class attributes, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially user-defined functions (`primal_fn`, `rewrite_fn`) and external solvers, but no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows through function calls within the autodiff and checkpointing logic; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard autodiff techniques (checkpointing, implicit differentiation) using well-known scientific libraries. It does not perform system modifications, network calls, or contain obfuscated code. The reliance on user-provided functions is typical in scientific workflows and does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of advanced autodiff methods with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given its scientific computing purpose.",
