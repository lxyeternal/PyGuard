  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility setup for type annotations and internal markers. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0.1) due to the use of an internal module, which is acceptable given the context."
