  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of fixed point solving routines with no malicious or security concerns. The internal adjustments are benign and standard for scientific libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the purely computational nature."
