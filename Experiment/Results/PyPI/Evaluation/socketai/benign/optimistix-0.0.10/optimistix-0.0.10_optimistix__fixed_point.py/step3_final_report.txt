{
  "purpose": "A fixed point solver framework utilizing JAX and Equinox, supporting multiple solver types with internal shape validation and compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`fn`), initial guesses (`y0`), and solver options; data flows into iterative routines and function calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing within solver routines; no external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O detected.",
  "flows": "User-defined `fn` called repeatedly during iteration; data flows from inputs through solver steps to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional reassignment of `_rewrite_fn` based on module globals and use of `del inputs` are internal compatibility measures, not malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of fixed point solvers with shape validation, mathematical transformations, and solver orchestration. No suspicious obfuscation, external data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The internal handling of `_rewrite_fn` is a known pattern for compatibility, not malicious intent. The mathematical operations are typical for numerical algorithms. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of fixed point solving routines with no malicious or security concerns. The internal adjustments are benign and standard for scientific libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the purely computational nature.",
