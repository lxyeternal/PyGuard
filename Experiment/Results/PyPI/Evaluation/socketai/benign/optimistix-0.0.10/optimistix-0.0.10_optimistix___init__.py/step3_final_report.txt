{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer or module export script, organizing internal components and retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and the call to importlib.metadata.version for package version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static imports and version retrieval only.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version retrieval are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard internal import module, exposing various classes and functions for a Python package. It uses static import statements and retrieves package version info via importlib.metadata, which is a common practice. No external data handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup or __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use in production.",
