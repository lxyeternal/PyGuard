  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is a straightforward import script with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It correctly identifies that the code only imports internal modules and retrieves the package version.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard package initializer with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, confirms that the code is a typical library setup, with no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is a straightforward API export with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, identifying the code as a standard import aggregator for optimization solvers, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a simple import script, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- **Malware Concerns:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity. The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's function.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code—importing internal modules and retrieving package version—there's no justification for a risk score above 0.1, and certainly not above 0.5.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0** or very close to it, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**In conclusion**, based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments that this is a benign, standard package initialization script with no security issues.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's purpose.",
