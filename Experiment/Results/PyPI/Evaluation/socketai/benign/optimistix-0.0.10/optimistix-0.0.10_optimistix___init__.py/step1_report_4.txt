{
  "purpose": "The code is a module that imports various functions, classes, and constants from its own package submodules, likely to expose a public API for mathematical and optimization routines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal submodules, package metadata via importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "No evident sink where untrusted data is processed or exported; package version is retrieved but not used maliciously",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow indicating malicious data manipulation; data flows are limited to internal module imports and version retrieval",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors; all imports are from local modules, and no dynamic code execution is present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from various internal submodules, indicating modular design. It retrieves the package version through importlib.metadata.version, which is standard for package metadata. No external inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clean, structured, and serves as an API interface for optimization routines without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API export module for an optimization library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The package appears safe based on this snippet.",
