  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security issues, or logical flaws.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for the DevOps Guru client, referencing external API documentation. No executable logic, only type hints and structure.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity. The code is purely declarative, serving as a type stub.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Risk score is 0, appropriate for a type stub.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS SDK. No runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Standard SDK interface.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, legitimate SDK stub code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0. Risk score is 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS DevOps Guru SDK.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No malicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Standard SDK interface. No security concerns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Risk score is 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type annotations and method signatures for the SDK client.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation. Methods are standard API wrappers.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK stub code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Risk score is 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to previous reports—SDK interface definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly a standard, safe SDK stub.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Risk score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Code presence:** All reports contain only static type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and documentation links.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; these are SDK interface stubs meant for type safety and IDE support.\n- **Scores:** All malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistency across all reports, the code is a benign, well-structured SDK stub with no security risks. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the content.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**This code is safe, legitimate, and purely for type annotations.**",
