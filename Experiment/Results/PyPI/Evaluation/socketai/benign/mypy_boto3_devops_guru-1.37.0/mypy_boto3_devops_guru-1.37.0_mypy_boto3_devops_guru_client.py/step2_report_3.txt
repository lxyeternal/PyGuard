  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking for potential security issues, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code provides type annotations and client class definitions for boto3 DevOps Guru, sourced from imports and class/method definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods generate URLs, perform API calls, or handle untrusted data, but within a standard SDK context.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is purely an SDK interface with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, benign, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on type annotations and SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External inputs via kwargs, but no data manipulation or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. The code is a typical SDK interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also legitimate, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations, class definitions, API endpoint descriptions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leakage or malicious data flow observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, with full confidence (1.0). No malware or risks.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Clearly a standard SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on type annotations, method signatures, and properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept kwargs, return URLs or dicts—standard for SDK wrappers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious elements, high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—type annotations, class, method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods generate URLs, perform API calls—standard SDK behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe SDK stub, high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS DevOps Guru, with no executable logic, no dynamic code, no network activity embedded in the code itself.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Ranging from 0.95 to 1.0, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely declarative, consisting of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.\n- No suspicious data flows, code execution, or network activity is embedded.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is to serve as a type stub/interface for AWS SDK, which is a common, legitimate pattern.\n\n### **Estimated Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface stub with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe and appropriate for static analysis, IDE support, and type checking.",
