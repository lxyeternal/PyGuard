  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 DevOps Guru service, providing structured access to AWS DevOps Guru API functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings defining API endpoints and behaviors.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leakage points or execution of untrusted code observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls are straightforward API wrappers; no dynamic code execution or data flow to malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or backdoors detected. The code is primarily type annotations, documentation links, and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings describing API endpoints for the AWS DevOps Guru client. No code performs data manipulation, network operations, or system commands. It uses standard AWS SDK patterns and includes overloads for paginators. The initial imports and class structures follow normal patterns for SDK type stubs. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are present. All functionalities are consistent with a type stub or SDK interface definition, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a type annotation and client interface for AWS DevOps Guru, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK stub implementation intended for type checking and documentation support.",
