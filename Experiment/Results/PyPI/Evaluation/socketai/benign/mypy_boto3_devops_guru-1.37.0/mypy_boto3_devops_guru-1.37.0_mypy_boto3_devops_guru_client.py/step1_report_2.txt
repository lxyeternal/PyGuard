  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS DevOps Guru service, facilitating typed access to the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class property and method definitions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that accept parameters unpacked from external input (kwargs) and return typed responses; potential for untrusted data processing in these method parameters.",
  "flows": "External inputs passed via **kwargs to various API methods, with no direct data processing within this code fragment; methods returning typed responses, no data manipulation shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code patterns. The code primarily consists of interface definitions and type annotations, which are standard for SDK wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK interface wrapper with type annotations, properties, and method signatures for the AWS DevOps Guru client. It uses overloads for paginator methods, type hints for request and response types, and structured documentation links. There is no data processing, external data handling, or network activity within this code snippet. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It contains type annotations and method signatures for AWS SDK operations, serving as a type-safe wrapper. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
