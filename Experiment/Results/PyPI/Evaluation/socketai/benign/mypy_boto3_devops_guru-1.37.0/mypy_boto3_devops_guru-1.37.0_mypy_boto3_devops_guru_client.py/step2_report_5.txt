  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 DevOps Guru client.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no network activity, no embedded secrets. The code is purely type annotations and SDK interface setup.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, legitimate SDK stub.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and client class for AWS DevOps Guru.  \n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious logic, no data leaks, no obfuscation. It’s a standard SDK interface.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious SDK stub.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and client interface for AWS DevOps Guru.  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above, standard SDK interface, no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe SDK stub.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and client interface for boto3 DevOps Guru.  \n- **Analysis:** Again, purely SDK interface with no dynamic code, no network, no secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK stub.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and class stub for boto3 DevOps Guru.  \n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—no malicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK stub, benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports describe static SDK interface code, primarily type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links.\n- No code performs dynamic execution, network activity, data manipulation, or any suspicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose across all reports is to facilitate type safety and IDE support for the boto3 AWS SDK, specifically for the DevOps Guru service.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a collection of type annotations and SDK interface definitions for AWS DevOps Guru, serving as static type stubs. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code's structure aligns with standard SDK stub generation for static analysis and IDE support.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**These reflect the benign, non-executable, purely declarative nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with benign SDK stub code, and no further action is necessary.",
