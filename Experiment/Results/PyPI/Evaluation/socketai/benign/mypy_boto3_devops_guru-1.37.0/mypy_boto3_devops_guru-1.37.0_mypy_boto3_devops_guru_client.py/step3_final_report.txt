  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 DevOps Guru client, serving as static SDK interface stubs for type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of SDK modules, class and method signatures, type definitions, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters accepting kwargs, URL generation, and response return types; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs leading to API responses or URL generation; no dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for the AWS DevOps Guru SDK. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation. The code is standard for SDK type stubs, with documentation links for reference. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub intended for static type checking and IDE support. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
