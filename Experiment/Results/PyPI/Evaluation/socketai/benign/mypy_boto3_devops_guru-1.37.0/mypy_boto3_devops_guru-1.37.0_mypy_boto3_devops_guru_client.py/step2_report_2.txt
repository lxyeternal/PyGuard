  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, logical consistency, and the presence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** It correctly states that this is a type annotation and client class for boto3 DevOps Guru, with sources being imports and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods involve URL generation and API calls, typical for SDK wrappers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is standard SDK interface code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that this is benign and the confidence level (0.95) are appropriate.\n\n**Security Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on SDK interface definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept kwargs and return typed responses; no data manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly identified as a legitimate SDK interface, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Security Assessment:** No malware or malicious activity. Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and API endpoint definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leakage or malicious code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK stub, high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Security Assessment:** No security issues. Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, class signatures, and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods like `generate_presigned_url`, `add_notification_channel`, etc., are standard SDK methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly a standard SDK interface. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Security Assessment:** No malware or malicious activity. Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK stub definitions, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods involve URL generation and API calls, typical for SDK interfaces.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe SDK stub code, high confidence (1).\n\n**Security Assessment:** No malicious activity. Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign SDK interface/type stub code.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity or vulnerabilities, the risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, well-structured SDK interface code with no security concerns.",
