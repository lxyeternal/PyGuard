  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 DevOps Guru service, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Generate presigned URL method, various API methods accepting kwargs unpacked from type definitions, and paginator creation methods.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (kwargs) from user inputs flow into API calls; generate_presigned_url and other methods produce URLs or dicts based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code; usage of type hints and method signatures are standard; no code that indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations, class structures, method signatures, and property definitions for a boto3 client. There are no executable code blocks, dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or data leaks. The class 'DevOpsGuruClient' and 'Exceptions' are structured as type-safe wrappers around API operations, with no embedded logic or data manipulations. All imports and code patterns align with typical SDK stub implementations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of type annotations and client interface definitions for the boto3 DevOps Guru SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It serves purely to enable type checking and IDE support for the SDK.",
