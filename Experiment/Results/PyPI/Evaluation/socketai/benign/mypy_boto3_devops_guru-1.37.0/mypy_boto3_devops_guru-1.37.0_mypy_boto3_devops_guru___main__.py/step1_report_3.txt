  "purpose": "Provide CLI information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 DevOpsGuru stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input argument parsing, sys.stdout.write for output display",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout, which could potentially be captured or redirected",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) triggers version info or package info output via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and solely outputs static informational text.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple functions to output static package info and version details. It processes command-line arguments to determine whether to output version info or package info. There are no data flows involving untrusted input beyond argument check, and all outputs are static strings. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure is simple and adheres to standard CLI patterns. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a CLI informational script. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activities. It functions solely to display static package information based on user input.",
