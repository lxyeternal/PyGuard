{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes output directly to stdout, which is generally safe. No untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is present, calls print_version() which outputs version info. Otherwise, calls print_info() which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple input handling by checking for a specific command-line argument '--version'. It then prints static information about the package and its documentation links. The functions are straightforward, with no external dependencies beyond the standard library, and no data leaks or malicious behavior observed. The output is static and safe. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that provides package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
