  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the boto3 DevOpsGuru package, including version info and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version details)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), potential command-line argument '--version' affects program flow",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward informational output.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that outputs package information and version details. It reads command-line arguments to determine output. No external data sources, no user input, no data leaks or malicious code. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. No network activity, no file operations, no secret handling, and no code injection mechanisms. The logic is clear, and all outputs are static informational strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended for displaying package info and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility with no security concerns.",
