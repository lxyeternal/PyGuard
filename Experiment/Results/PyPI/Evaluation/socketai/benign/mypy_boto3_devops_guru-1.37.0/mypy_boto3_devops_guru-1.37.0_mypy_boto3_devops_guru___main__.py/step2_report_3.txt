  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version info based on a command-line argument.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data processing beyond argument checking.\n   - No obfuscation, no hidden behaviors, no credentials, or secret handling.\n   - All output is static and safe.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They uniformly describe the code as a simple informational CLI utility.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent, emphasizing the static nature and safety of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0` — correct, no malware present.\n     - `obfuscated: 0` — correct, code is straightforward.\n     - `securityRisk: 0` — correct, no security risks detected.\n     - `confidence: 1` — justified, the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n   - No report suggests any reason to alter these scores.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they are cautious and conclude benign nature.\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, there are no suspicious behaviors to challenge.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code is purely static, with no dynamic or external dependencies.\n   - No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The outputs are static strings, and the argument handling is minimal.\n\n6. **My Final Estimation:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n   - **Justification:** The code is a benign CLI utility with no suspicious features.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple, safe CLI script providing static informational output. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Maintain high confidence (1) due to thorough and consistent analysis.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores: 0.**",
