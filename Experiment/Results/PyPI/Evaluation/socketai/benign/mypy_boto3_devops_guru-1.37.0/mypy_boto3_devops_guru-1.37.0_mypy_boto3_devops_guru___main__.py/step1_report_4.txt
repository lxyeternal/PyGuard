  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for printing output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info and version details.",
  "flows": "User runs the script with or without --version argument, which triggers printing of version info or package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external data fetching, or hidden behaviors. The script performs straightforward I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information about the package and its version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs text via sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or any suspicious logic. It functions solely to display static data, with clear and straightforward code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving as a CLI interface for informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
