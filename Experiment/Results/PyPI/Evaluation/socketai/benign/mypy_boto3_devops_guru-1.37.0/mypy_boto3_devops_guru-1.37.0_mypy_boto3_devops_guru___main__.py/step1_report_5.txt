  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational outputs about boto3 DevOpsGuru and related packages.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output, standard library functions",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; sys.argv input is only used for a simple version check; no untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic CLI operations: checking arguments and printing predefined static information. It does not process or transmit untrusted data, and there are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code segments. The logic is simple, and the code relies solely on standard library functions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple informational CLI tool. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
