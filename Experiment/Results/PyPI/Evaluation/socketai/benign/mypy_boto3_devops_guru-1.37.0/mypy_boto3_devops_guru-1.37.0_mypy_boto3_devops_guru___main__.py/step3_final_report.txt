{
  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and outputs static strings via `sys.stdout.write`.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are static; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to printing version; otherwise, prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on argument input. It uses only standard library functions with no dynamic code execution, external dependencies, or data leaks. No obfuscation, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is correct and minimal, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The static nature and simplicity strongly indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.",
