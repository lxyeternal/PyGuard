{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for devops-guru service API responses and requests, primarily used for SDK and API client implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module. Type definitions and class declarations utilizing TypedDict and unions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No untrusted data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to static type definitions used for API request/response schemas, with no dynamic or runtime data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data. No suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or runtime execution constructs. Usage of standard typing and data structure patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines Python data types and schemas using TypedDict and Union for a large SDK module related to devops-guru. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice. No network, file, or external data handling, and no code execution logic, is present. The code is purely declarative for type hinting and API schema modeling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The structure and imports appear legitimate and consistent with SDK type definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK type definitions file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only provides static type annotations for API request/response schemas, with no runtime or external interactions.",
