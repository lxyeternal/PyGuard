  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for devops-guru service API responses and requests.",
  "sources": "Imported modules, type definitions, and data structure declarations",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing or serialization points, but none indicate untrusted data handling or external data flow",
  "flows": "Data definitions are used for API request/response serialization; no runtime data flow or external input handling is present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code consists solely of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines typed dictionaries for API request and response structures, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic execution, network operations, or security-sensitive logic is present. The structure appears consistent with SDK type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code is static and purely declarative, focusing on type annotations for a SDK or API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type definitions for a SDK, with no malicious intent, no dynamic or runtime data handling that could be exploited. It appears to be a standard, benign, type annotation module for devops-guru SDK bindings.",
