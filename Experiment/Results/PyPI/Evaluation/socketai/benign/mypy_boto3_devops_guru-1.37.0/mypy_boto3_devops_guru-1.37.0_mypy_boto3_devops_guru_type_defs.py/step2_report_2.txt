  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n- The code is a set of type annotations, TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.  \n- No runtime logic, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution is present.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.  \n- The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas for API requests and responses.\n\n**2. Logical or Reasoning Flaws in the Reports:**  \n- The reports consistently state that the code is solely for type annotations and data schemas, with no malicious intent or security risks.  \n- They correctly identify that the code uses standard practices like conditional imports for compatibility, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.  \n- No overreaching assumptions or flawed reasoning are evident; the conclusions are supported by the code's static and declarative nature.\n\n**3. Score Justifications and Recommendations:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the fact that the code is only type definitions with no security implications.\n\n**4. Critical Evaluation of the Scores:**  \n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.  \n- No adjustments needed; the code is benign and purely for static type checking.\n\n**5. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is not executing any logic, handling untrusted data, or performing external operations.  \n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond the code's static analysis, which is appropriate.\n\n**6. Overall Security Assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard type definition module for an SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks identified)  \n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a comprehensive set of static type annotations for API data schemas. It employs standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports for compatibility, and contains no runtime logic, external calls, or sensitive data. The consistent reports and their reasoning align with this assessment.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and solely intended for type safety and validation within an SDK. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
