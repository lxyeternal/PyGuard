{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the devops-guru service, providing type safety and clarity for API data models.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local type definition modules; class and variable definitions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data inputs via dictionaries, type annotations, and optional fields, which are mainly for data modeling and validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (e.g., API responses or user-provided data) into typed dictionaries and unions, serving as schema definitions; no execution or data manipulation flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily a set of type definitions and data models with no executable logic or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. The import of sys and version-based conditional imports is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and NotRequired, along with imports conditioned on Python version for compatibility. All classes and variables are for static type checking and data validation, with no runtime or malicious code. The structure aligns with typical API schema definitions. No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns identified. The presence of import statements, type annotations, and data class definitions is consistent with a security-conscious approach to API modeling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard type definition file for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious activity. It is purely for type safety and data validation. No security risks or malware detected.",
