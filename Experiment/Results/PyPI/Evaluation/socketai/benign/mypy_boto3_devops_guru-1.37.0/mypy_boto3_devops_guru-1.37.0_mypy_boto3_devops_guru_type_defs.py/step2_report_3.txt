  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a large collection of type annotations and data schemas for the AWS devops-guru SDK.\n- It uses TypedDict, Union, NotRequired, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external system interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for type safety, validation, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** No runtime issues, no security flaws, no malicious code, no obfuscation. The code strictly defines data schemas.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes detected. The code is consistent with standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n  - Risk: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0, as there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** Also 0, which is justified because the code is purely type annotations and data schemas.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not process untrusted data at runtime; it only declares data structures.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's purpose.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is static, schema-defining code with no security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis and the nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK type definition module with no security concerns.",
