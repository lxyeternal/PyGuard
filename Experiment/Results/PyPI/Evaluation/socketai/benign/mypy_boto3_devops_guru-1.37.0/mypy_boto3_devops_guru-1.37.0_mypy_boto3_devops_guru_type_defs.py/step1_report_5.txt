{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for devops-guru service type definitions, primarily for documentation, type checking, and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; type definitions and data structures throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; code mostly defines data structures without executing external or untrusted operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code only defines type structures and constants; no runtime logic or data processing is included.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code is a large set of type definitions and interface schemas. No dynamically executed code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of TypedDict and Union type definitions used for AWS DevOps Guru SDK typings. It imports standard and third-party typing modules, with conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime logic, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. All parts serve as data structure definitions for API request/response modeling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified. The content is consistent with typical SDK type definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code strictly consists of type definitions for SDK data models, with no malicious, maliciously obfuscated, or harmful components detected. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations intended for static type checking and documentation purposes only.",
