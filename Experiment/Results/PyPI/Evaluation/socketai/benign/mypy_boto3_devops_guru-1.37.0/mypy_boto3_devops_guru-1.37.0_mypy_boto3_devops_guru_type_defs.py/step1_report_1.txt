{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the devops-guru service, facilitating type checking and validation of API data exchanges.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from '.literals', standard library modules (sys, datetime), and type annotations used for defining TypedDicts and Unions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data flow to external systems or insecure handling identified within this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines data schemas without runtime data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is solely type annotations and schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining typed dictionaries and union types for the devops-guru service. It imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version, which is standard practice. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code does not include any suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. It strictly declares data structures for API communication, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and solely for type safety and validation purposes.",
