{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data schemas for the devops-guru SDK, defining request and response data structures for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static type definitions, including TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain executable logic; it only defines data schemas used by other runtime components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, and conditional imports for compatibility. It lacks runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscated constructs. The code's purpose is to define data schemas for API requests and responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK type definition module with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. It is purely declarative and safe.",
