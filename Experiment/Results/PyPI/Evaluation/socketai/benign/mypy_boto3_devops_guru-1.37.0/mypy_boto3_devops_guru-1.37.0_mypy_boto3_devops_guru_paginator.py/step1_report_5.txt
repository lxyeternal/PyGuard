  "purpose": "Define strongly typed paginator classes for the AWS DevOps Guru service client, enabling type-safe pagination over various API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Import statements, including type definitions, system version checks, and boto3 paginator classes.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to 'client.get_paginator' with string arguments specifying the API operation; use of 'paginate' methods with unpacked kwargs.",
  "flows": "Client methods produce paginator instances; 'paginate' methods pass kwargs to underlying paginator, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Usage of standard boto3 and typing patterns. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for various AWS DevOps Guru API operations with proper type annotations and documentation links. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for 'Unpack'. The classes extend generic Paginator types with specific response and request types. The 'paginate' methods are overridden with precise type hints. The code adheres to typical boto3-stubs patterns and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external data leaks, code injections, or hidden behaviors are present. The focus is on type safety and documentation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for AWS SDK paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
