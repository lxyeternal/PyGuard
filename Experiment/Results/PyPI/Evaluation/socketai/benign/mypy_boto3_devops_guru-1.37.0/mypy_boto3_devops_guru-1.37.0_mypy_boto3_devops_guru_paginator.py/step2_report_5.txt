  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, potential security implications, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type-annotated paginator classes for boto3 devops-guru, with no data processing or external calls. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the benign nature. The malware score of 0 is justified. The code is purely type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and paginator class definitions. No dynamic code or untrusted data processing is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The use of **kwargs in paginate methods is standard and not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard type annotation module for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code is boilerplate with documentation links.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. No suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines paginator classes with conditional base class assignment based on TYPE_CHECKING, standard in type stubs. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The risk score could be slightly lower (0) since there's no evident risk, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on type annotations and class definitions, with no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is justified given the benign, purely type annotation nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, consistent with the straightforward, boilerplate code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is acceptable for conservative risk assessment of code that handles untrusted input via kwargs, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the code's nature, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 — the minimal potential for risk due to handling untrusted input in paginate methods, but no actual security concern.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable and conservative.\n- No further action needed; the code is a standard, safe type annotation module for boto3 paginators.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\nThe code appears safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated content.",
