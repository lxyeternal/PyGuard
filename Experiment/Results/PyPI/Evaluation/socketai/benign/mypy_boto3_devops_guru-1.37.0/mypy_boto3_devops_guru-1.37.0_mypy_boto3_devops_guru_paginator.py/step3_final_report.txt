  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 devops-guru paginators, providing type safety and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The 'paginate' methods with '**kwargs' and class inheritance structures, conditional imports, and documentation URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' method receives '**kwargs' which are passed to the underlying Paginator; no external data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for SDK stub classes, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for boto3 paginators with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation links. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The use of '**kwargs' in 'paginate' is typical for SDK patterns and does not introduce security risks. The code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate for type safety, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type-safe interface for boto3 paginator classes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
