  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the devops-guru service client in boto3, providing structured pagination support for various API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; dynamic class inheritance based on TYPE_CHECKING; paginator class methods calling self.paginate with unpacked kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods call self.paginate with unpacked kwargs, but do not execute any other untrusted code or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from kwargs flows into the paginate method, which then calls self.paginate with Unpack, resulting in no external or network effects. The code primarily defines class structures and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code uses standard Python typing and class inheritance patterns. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. Documentation links are for reference only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured definition of paginator classes for boto3's devops-guru client, with conditional base class assignment based on TYPE_CHECKING. It employs type hints, dynamic class inheritance, and standard method overrides. There are no signs of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of self.paginate with **kwargs, which is standard in boto3 paginator patterns and does not involve executing untrusted code or network calls within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginator classes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as an interface for type checking and code completion, without executing any harmful actions.",
