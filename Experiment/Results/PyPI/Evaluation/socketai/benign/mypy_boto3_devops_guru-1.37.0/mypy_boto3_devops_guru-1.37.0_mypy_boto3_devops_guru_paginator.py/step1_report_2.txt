  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the devops-guru service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that call self.paginate with unpacked kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods invoke self.paginate with **kwargs, which are untrusted input; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted kwargs flow into self.paginate calls within each paginator class method, which then return PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code mostly consists of class definitions, type annotations, and documentation URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the devops-guru boto3 client with proper type annotations and documentation links. It includes conditional imports for Unpack depending on Python version and uses TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations are observed. The use of self.paginate with unpacked kwargs is standard for such SDK paginator classes and poses no security concern. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injections are present. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type hinting module for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and safe type annotation module for boto3 devops-guru paginators. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily provides type-safe interfaces for SDK pagination functionality.",
