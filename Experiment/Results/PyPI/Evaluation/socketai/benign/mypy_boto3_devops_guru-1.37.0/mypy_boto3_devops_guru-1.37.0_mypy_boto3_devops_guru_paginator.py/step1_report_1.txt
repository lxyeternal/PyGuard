  "purpose": "Define paginators for the devops-guru service client with type annotations to facilitate type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the boto3 devops-guru client via the get_paginator method and type definition imports. It also reads sys.version_info to determine conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the paginator methods, which could handle untrusted data if user-supplied parameters are used. No direct untrusted data handling or network activity is evident.",
  "flows": "The data flows from user-supplied **kwargs in paginate methods into the Paginator classes, which then yield pages of responses. The code is mainly type annotation and class structure, with no data transformation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly defines type-safe paginator classes with documented URLs and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, type-annotated module for boto3 paginators, importing type definitions, conditionally importing Unpack based on Python version, and defining classes that extend Paginator with proper type annotations. No data is processed or transmitted within this code; it serves solely as type-safe interface definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The use of standard library modules and well-documented third-party libraries, along with the absence of dynamic code execution or external calls, indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3 devops-guru client with extensive type annotations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. Its sole function is to provide type safety and documentation for paginator usage.",
