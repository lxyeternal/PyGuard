{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-devops-guru', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setuptools for packaging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads package description, version, dependencies, and metadata from static files and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data leakage points.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a markdown file for long description, and calling setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package distribution scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no external data inputs beyond static files, and no unsafe operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only performs package configuration and metadata setup, which are safe activities.",
