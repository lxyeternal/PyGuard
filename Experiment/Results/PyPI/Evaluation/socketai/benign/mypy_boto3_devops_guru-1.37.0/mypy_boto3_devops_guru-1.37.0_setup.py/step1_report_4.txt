  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-devops-guru', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; reads package metadata; imports from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks detected; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and package metadata, then passes data to 'setup()' for packaging. No untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' and 'setuptools' for package setup. Reads a README file for long description. Calls 'setup()' with package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The script follows standard packaging practices without anomalies or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
