  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-devops-guru package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() with static data; no data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Static data used to configure package; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistency: copyright year 2025 (future date), URL points to unrelated repository, but no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script, importing only necessary modules, reading a static README file, and calling setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Minor issues such as the future year and URL mismatch are non-security concerns but worth noting for correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
