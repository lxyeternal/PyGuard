  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-devops-guru', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static string values for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data input, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears standard for a Python setup script, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools for package setup. It reads the README.md file for the long description, then calls setup() with various metadata fields, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network operations, or executable code is present. The code strictly adheres to common setup patterns without any anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies.",
