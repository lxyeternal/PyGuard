  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-devops-guru package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to locate README.md and the setup() parameters to define package info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or external inputs handled in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script purely defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setuptools, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no sensitive information handling are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
