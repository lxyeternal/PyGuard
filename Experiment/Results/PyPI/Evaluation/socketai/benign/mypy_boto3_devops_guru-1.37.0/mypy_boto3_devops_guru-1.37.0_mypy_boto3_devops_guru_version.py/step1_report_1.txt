  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a static value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating 'Source of truth for version' and a copyright notice, but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a version string and a comment about its purpose. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code appears straightforward and benign. The copyright year is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions solely as a metadata marker for the package.",
