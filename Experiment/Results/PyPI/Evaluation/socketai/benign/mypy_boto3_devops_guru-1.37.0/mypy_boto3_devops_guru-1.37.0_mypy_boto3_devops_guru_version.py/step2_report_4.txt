  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Validity\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Code correctness:** The code is valid Python and functions as intended for setting package version metadata.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n- No factual errors or logical flaws are present in any report.\n- The analysis is consistent and accurate; all reports correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Special Considerations\n- The only point of note is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't indicate malicious intent. It could be a typo or an oversight, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and safety. The only minor anomaly—the future copyright year—is not a security issue.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
