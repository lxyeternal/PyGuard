{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; the assignment is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment and a copyright notice. No dynamic code, inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present. The only anomaly is the future year, which is not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The scores are justified and should remain as is. The unusual future year does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
