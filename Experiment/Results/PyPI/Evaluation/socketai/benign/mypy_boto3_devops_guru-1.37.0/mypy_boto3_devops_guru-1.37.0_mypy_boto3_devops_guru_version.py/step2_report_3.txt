  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and evaluate the evidence.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code serves purely as metadata, which is a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies:**\n   - The only unusual aspect noted is the copyright year being 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). While unconventional, this is not inherently malicious or a security concern.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n   - The scores assigned are all zero for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclusions are based on straightforward analysis.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n   - The only notable point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are needed.\n\n**My own estimate for the scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The future copyright year is unusual but not problematic. The assessments and scores are justified and should remain as is.",
