  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code. The code in question is a simple static assignment:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues**  \n- The code is straightforward: a comment, a copyright notice, and a static string assignment.  \n- No dynamic code, no inputs, no external data handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.  \n- The presence of a future year (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard practice, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- The analysis notes the static nature, absence of data flows, and no external interactions, which is accurate.  \n- The mention of the future copyright year as unusual is valid but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**  \n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1), zero obfuscated, zero malware, and zero security risk.  \n- These seem appropriate given the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**  \n- No issues are present that would warrant a higher risk score.  \n- The code is purely metadata with no malicious activity.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**  \n- The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct.  \n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**  \n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a typo or a placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, I concur with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Value |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Malware          | 0      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0      |\n| Security Risk    | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.",
