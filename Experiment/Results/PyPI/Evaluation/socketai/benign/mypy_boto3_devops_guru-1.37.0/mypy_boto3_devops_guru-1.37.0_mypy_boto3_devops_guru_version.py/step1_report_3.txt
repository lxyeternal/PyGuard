  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no dynamic behavior. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to declare version information this way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
