  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code simply declares a `__version__` variable with a static string `\"1.37.0\"`.\n   - It contains comments and a copyright notice, with the year 2025, which is in the future.\n   - There are no functions, input/output handling, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, serving as a metadata marker.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious intent, or backdoors.\n   - The future copyright year is unusual but not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `confidence` = 1\n   - These are consistent with the analysis; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The only anomaly is the future year (2025), which is not a security concern but might be a typo or oversight.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - The current scores seem appropriate.\n   - Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, a `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The `obfuscated` score remains 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The `securityRisk` score remains 0, as the code is benign.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical version declaration with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's simplicity.",
