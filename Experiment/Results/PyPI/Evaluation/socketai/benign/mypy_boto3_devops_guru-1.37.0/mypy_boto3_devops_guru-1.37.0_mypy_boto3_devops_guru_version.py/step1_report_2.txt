  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code present; only metadata is defined.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to '__version__', which is standard practice for Python packages. There are no inputs, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors. The only content is a version declaration and a comment. No obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
