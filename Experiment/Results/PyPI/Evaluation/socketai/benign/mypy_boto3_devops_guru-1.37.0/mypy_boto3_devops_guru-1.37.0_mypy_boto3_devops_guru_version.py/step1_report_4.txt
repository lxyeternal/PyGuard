  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future date (2025), which may be unusual but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for the package and includes a copyright notice. The version string is static and hardcoded. No input, no external data, and no code that could be malicious. The future copyright date might be unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious constructs or behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple version declaration with an unusual future copyright date. No malicious or security concerns identified.",
