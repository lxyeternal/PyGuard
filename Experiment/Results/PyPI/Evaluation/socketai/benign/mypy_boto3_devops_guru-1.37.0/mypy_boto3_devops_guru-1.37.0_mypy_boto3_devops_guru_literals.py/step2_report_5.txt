  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, assessing the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS DevOps Guru and related AWS services.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n- The purpose is to provide type safety and better code clarity for SDK usage.\n- The copyright date in the header is set to 2025, which is in the future, likely a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-Issue Review:\n\n#### 1. **Malware or Suspicious Behavior**\n- **Findings:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is a standard type alias module.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscation**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques such as encoded strings, convoluted logic, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Not obfuscated.\n\n#### 3. **Security Risks**\n- **Findings:** The code does not process user input, handle secrets, or perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n#### 4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws**\n- **Findings:** The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which seems to be a placeholder or typo.\n- **Analysis:** This is not a security concern but could be corrected for accuracy.\n- **Conclusion:** No vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is static, no runtime logic, and only defines type aliases, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n- The only potential concern is the future date, but it does not impact security or integrity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \n**Risk:** **0** (or very close to zero)\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured constants module for type safety, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. No changes or concerns are necessary from a security perspective.",
