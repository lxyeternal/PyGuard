{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various DevOps Guru and AWS service-related constants to be used for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from its own definitions and the sys module for version checking.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no external data is processed or written.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network access is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. It then defines a large set of string literal types used for type safety. The entire code is static, with no runtime logic beyond imports and definitions. No data input/output or external interactions are included. No indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS DevOps and other AWS services. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no external network activities. It is a standard, safe module purely for type safety and code clarity.",
