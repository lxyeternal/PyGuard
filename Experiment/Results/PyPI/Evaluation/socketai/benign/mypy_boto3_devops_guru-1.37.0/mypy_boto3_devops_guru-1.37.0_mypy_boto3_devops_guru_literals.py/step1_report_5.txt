{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various devops-guru related constants to be used with type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions; no input or data reading occurring in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points; the code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; code is straightforward, static type definitions with no dynamic execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'Literal' from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases for specific string literals used in the devops-guru service. There is no input handling, no external data, no code execution beyond import, and no dynamic or obfuscated elements. The purpose is purely to provide type-safe string constants for use in a larger SDK or application. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for static analysis, documentation, and type safety. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, merely static constants for the devops-guru service. It appears to be a safe and benign part of a SDK or type definition library.",
