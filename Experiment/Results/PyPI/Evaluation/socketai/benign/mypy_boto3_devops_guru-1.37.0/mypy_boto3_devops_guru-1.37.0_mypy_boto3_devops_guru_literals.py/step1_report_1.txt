{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS DevOps Guru service parameters and constants to enable type safety and better code clarity in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from predefined string literals assigned to variables and imported modules for version checking.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted input sources or sinks; it only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources into sensitive sinks; the file only declares type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and only defines type literals without any dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info, conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', and declares numerous string literal types for AWS DevOps Guru and other AWS service identifiers. It uses a well-structured approach for type annotations, with no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic. The file's content is purely declarative, serving as a constants module for type safety. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is the copyright date being in the future (2025), which appears to be a typographical or placeholder date, but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definitions module intended for enhancing type safety and code readability in Python projects interacting with AWS services. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It is a standard pattern for defining literal types for API parameters.",
