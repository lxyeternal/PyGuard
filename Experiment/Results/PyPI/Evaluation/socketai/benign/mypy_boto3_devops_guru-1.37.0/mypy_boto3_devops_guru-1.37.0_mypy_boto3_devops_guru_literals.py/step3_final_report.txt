{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS DevOps Guru service literals and related AWS service identifiers, serving as static type annotations for improved code safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Static literal definitions within the module; conditional import based on Python version; version info in header.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias declarations with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year in the header is set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module defining string literal types for AWS SDK parameters, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity is present. The structure is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and purpose-specific. No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type alias definitions for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type safety aid and contains no suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent in their assessments.",
