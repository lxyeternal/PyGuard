  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports to assess potential security concerns.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation & Content Review:**\n- The code is a static module defining numerous string literal types for AWS DevOps Guru and other AWS services.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- The code contains only type alias definitions, serving as constants for type safety and documentation.\n\n**2. Logical and Structural Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to common patterns for defining type literals in Python.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The copyright date in 2025 appears to be a placeholder or typo, but this is not malicious.\n\n**3. Malware and Malicious Behavior Evaluation:**\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- No external network access, data exfiltration, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module for type annotations.\n\n**4. Potential Security Risks:**\n- Since the code only defines static constants and types, the security risk is negligible.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n- The only minor concern is the future-looking copyright date, which is likely a placeholder and not malicious.\n\n**5. Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**6. Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and purpose-specific.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately high (1), given the static nature and clarity.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definitions module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for improving type safety in Python projects.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and contains no security concerns. The scores are appropriate as given.",
