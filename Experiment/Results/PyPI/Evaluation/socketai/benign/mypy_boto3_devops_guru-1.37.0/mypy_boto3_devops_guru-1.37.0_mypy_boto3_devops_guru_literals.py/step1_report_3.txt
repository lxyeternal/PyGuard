{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for devops-guru service and related AWS resource identifiers, facilitating type safety and validation in boto3 stub usage.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module for version check; assignment of string literals to variables for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; all data are static string literals used for type annotations.",
  "flows": "Static literals are assigned directly to type aliases; no data flow from external sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, with no unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from different modules based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward type annotation definitions for various AWS resource and service identifiers, with conditional import for compatibility. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The purpose aligns with improving type safety in boto3-related code. The only dynamic aspect is version-dependent import, which is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard set of type annotations for AWS resource identifiers used in boto3 SDK stubs. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is a well-structured, non-obfuscated declaration module for type hints.",
