  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining numerous string literal types for AWS DevOps Guru and related AWS services.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, external network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The content is purely declarative, serving as type annotations to improve code safety and clarity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The copyright date in the header (2025) appears to be a placeholder or typographical oversight, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the reports:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and purely declarative.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No logical or security flaws are detected in the code itself.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (0.5). Given the static nature and purpose, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Even if considering a minor concern about the future date, it doesn't constitute a security risk.\n\n### Justifications:\n\n- The code is purely for type safety, with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The conditional import for `Literal` is standard compatibility handling.\n- The large set of string literals enhances code clarity and type safety but does not introduce security concerns.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The only minor concern is the copyright date being in the future (2025). This is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.\n- No other assumptions or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n- **Further analysis:** No changes needed; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a well-structured, static type definitions module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code and reports are accurate. The code is benign, purely declarative, and serves as a type safety aid for AWS SDK usage. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
