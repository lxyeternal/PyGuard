  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS DevOps Guru service parameters and other AWS resource identifiers for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions of string values assigned to type aliases; imported modules for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using Python's Literal types for AWS resource identifiers and service parameters. It imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, which is standard. There are no input/output sources, no code execution, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type hinting module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative module for type hinting, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
