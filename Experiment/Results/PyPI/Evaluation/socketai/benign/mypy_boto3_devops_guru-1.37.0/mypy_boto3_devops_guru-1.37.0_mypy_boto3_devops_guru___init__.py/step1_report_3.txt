  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the devops-guru service, importing and exporting classes and paginators for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external or user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. No network, file, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The code mainly sets up class references and re-exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious constructs. The copyright date is in 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines an alias and __all__ for module exports. It contains no user input processing, no network calls, no system commands, and no data handling beyond class and function definitions. The comments provide documentation and usage examples. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard module setup for AWS SDK wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module for AWS DevOps Guru SDK interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly facilitates importing and exporting SDK classes. No malware or security issues detected.",
