{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface and documentation for the devops-guru service, providing a Python API wrapper with paginators for AWS DevOps Guru SDK functions.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules (.client and .paginator), and it also reads the string documentation block at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data processing or output. The code only defines imports, variables, and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply assigns imported classes to variables and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The documentation string is standard and static; no dynamic execution or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, class assignments, and module exports, with a large docstring explaining usage. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, primarily for interface definition and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign interface and documentation file for AWS DevOps Guru SDK components. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
