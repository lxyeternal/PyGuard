{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module that provides an interface to the AWS DevOps Guru SDK, importing relevant classes and functions, and defining exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.client and .paginator), and the docstring providing documentation and usage examples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform network operations beyond SDK calls, which are standard and controlled.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions, assigns a client alias, and exports them via __all__; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. The copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with static imports, class definitions, and documentation. It contains no dynamic or untrusted data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The use of AWS SDK calls is standard and does not introduce security risks at this layer. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK wrapper module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
