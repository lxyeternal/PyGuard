{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, queries logs from a specified workspace, and outputs the results in a key-value format.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for the workspace ID, input query string 'AppRequests | take 5', and data from Azure API responses.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages and query results to the console using print and pprint functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' → Azure API call → Response data → Output via pprint and print functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code patterns. Usage of environment variable for workspace ID is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code sections detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Azure SDK operations: authentication, querying, and printing data. No malicious or unusual code patterns are present. It does not process untrusted input beyond reading environment variables, nor does it perform insecure operations such as code injection, data exfiltration, or connecting to suspicious domains. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical usage patterns. There are no backdoors, malicious behaviors, or security risks evident in the code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example demonstrating Azure log querying with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a legitimate logging query script without any suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
