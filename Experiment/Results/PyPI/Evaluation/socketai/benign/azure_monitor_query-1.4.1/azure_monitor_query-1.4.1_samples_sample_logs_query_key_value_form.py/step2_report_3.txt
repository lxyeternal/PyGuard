  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, uses standard Azure SDKs, and performs log querying without obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate given the benign nature. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK usage, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard log query code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous reports; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard Azure SDK usage, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Appropriate low risk score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Identical to previous reports—legitimate, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Zero risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is standard, well-documented, and uses Azure SDKs properly. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal security concern given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on environment variables and standard SDKs, which is acceptable)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
