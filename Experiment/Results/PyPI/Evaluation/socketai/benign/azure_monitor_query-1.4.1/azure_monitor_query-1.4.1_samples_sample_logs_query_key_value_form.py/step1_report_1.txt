  "purpose": "The code demonstrates authenticating with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, querying logs from Azure Monitor, and printing the results in key-value form.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID for workspace ID; uses azure.identity and azure.monitor.query libraries for authentication and querying; takes input via environment variables and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data using pprint; no untrusted data sinks that leak sensitive data externally are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID -> Azure SDK query -> Response data -> Conversion to DataFrame -> Printing output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard Azure SDK usage; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates using DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard method for Azure SDKs. It queries Azure Monitor logs and processes the response to print data in a readable format. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The flow from input to output is straightforward and typical for an Azure SDK log query.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate Azure log query operation without any malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and primarily meant for monitoring and debugging purposes. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements are present.",
