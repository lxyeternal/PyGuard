  "purpose": "Authenticate with Azure and query logs from a workspace, then display the results in a key-value format.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID', Azure DefaultAzureCredential for token retrieval, user input via environment variables",
  "sinks": "Potential for data leakage if environment variables contain secrets, printing errors or data to console",
  "flows": "Credential and workspace ID from environment -> Query execution -> Results processed and printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual data handling",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates to Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard and secure method. It retrieves the workspace ID from environment variables and performs a log query. The code handles success and error responses appropriately, printing data in a readable format. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious external connections. The use of environment variables is standard for credential management. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of Azure log querying using Python SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
