{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates authenticating with Azure Monitor using DefaultAzureCredential, executing a simple log query, and printing the results in a key-value format.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID; the code reads this environment variable before querying.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code outputs data via pprint and prints errors to the console.",
  "flows": "The code reads the workspace ID from environment variables, executes a query via Azure SDK, and processes the response to display data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, uses standard SDKs, and handles errors properly.",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, performs a log query for the last day, and prints the results. It uses environment variables for configuration, handles success and error responses, and outputs data in a human-readable format. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code follows best practices for secure SDK usage and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Azure log query sample with no malicious intent or security issues. It employs proper practices and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
