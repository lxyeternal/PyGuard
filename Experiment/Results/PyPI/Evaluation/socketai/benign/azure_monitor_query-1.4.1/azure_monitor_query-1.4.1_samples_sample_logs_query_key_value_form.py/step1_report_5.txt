{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, queries logs from a specified workspace, and displays the results in a key-value format.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID; credential object for authentication; query string 'AppRequests | take 5' for log retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is being sent to untrusted locations or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Credential object and environment variable provide input; data is retrieved via Azure SDK; data is processed into DataFrame; output is printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; code performs standard Azure SDK log querying with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses environment variables for configuration, employs Azure SDKs for authentication and querying, and prints results locally. No data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or code injection observed. The code appears to be a straightforward sample for log querying.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure log querying with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
