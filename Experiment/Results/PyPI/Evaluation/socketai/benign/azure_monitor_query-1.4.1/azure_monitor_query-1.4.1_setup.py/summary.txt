  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor potential risk is the import of azure for version checking, which is a common practice and not inherently dangerous. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 due to environment considerations, but overall, the security posture is very low risk."
