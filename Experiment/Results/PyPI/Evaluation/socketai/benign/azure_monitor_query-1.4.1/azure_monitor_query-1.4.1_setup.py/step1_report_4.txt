  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'azure-monitor-query', handling version extraction, dependency specification, and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version.py or _version.py file; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; imports azure for version compatibility check.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes code in version.py/_version.py files; reads external files that could be malicious if manipulated; performs import of azure module which could execute code if maliciously tampered.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from version.py/_version.py -> used in setup() for package version; imports azure -> performs attribute check -> raises exception if version attribute exists; reads markdown files for long description -> passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a check on the azure package's version and raises an exception if incompatible; dynamically reads version info from external files; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network communications observed; the exception raising is standard but could be used maliciously if version.py is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file used for packaging Python modules. It includes version extraction by regex from a file, dependency specification, and package metadata. The version check for azure module is a validation step to prevent incompatible installations. File reads for README and CHANGELOG are typical for long description content. No external network connections or code execution beyond module import are present. The import of azure could execute malicious code if the package is compromised, but normally it is a safe import. The exception handling around azure import and version attribute check is standard. Overall, the code appears legitimate and typical for package setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with version validation, file reads, and dependency declarations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. It performs legitimate setup tasks without external network activity or hidden behaviors. The azure import is safe under normal circumstances but could pose risks if the package environment is compromised.",
