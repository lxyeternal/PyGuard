{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the packaging configuration for the 'azure-monitor-query' Python library, including version extraction, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a local version file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, imports azure to check version, and reads package files for setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly lead to untrusted data handling or malicious actions; setup parameters are static or sourced from trusted files.",
  "flows": "Version file content flows into the version parameter of setup(); static metadata and dependencies flow into setup() arguments; no untrusted data flows into executable code paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The azure module version check is benign, used for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, checking for incompatible azure versions, and configuring package metadata. All file reads are from local trusted files. The azure version check is a benign verification. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It reads trusted files and performs standard configuration tasks only.",
