{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, handling package metadata, version extraction, and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from version.py or _version.py; reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; importing azure to check version.",
  "sinks": "None of the file operations or imports directly process untrusted data; no code injection or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script primarily reads static files and package metadata, with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a check for the azure package's version to prevent incompatibility, but this is a standard compatibility check; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading version info from local files, verifying azure package version, and configuring package metadata for distribution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious network activities are evident. The version check logic is straightforward and only involves standard package imports. File reading is from local files only, with no untrusted input processing. The code appears to be legitimate and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations without suspicious activity.",
