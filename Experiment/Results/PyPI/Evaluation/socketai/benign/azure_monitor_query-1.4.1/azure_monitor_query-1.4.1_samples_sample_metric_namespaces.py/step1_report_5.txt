{
  "purpose": "To list all metric namespaces of an Azure resource using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'METRICS_RESOURCE_URI' for the resource URI; imported modules 'os', 'azure.identity', and 'azure.monitor.query'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "The environment variable provides input to 'metrics_uri', which is used in 'client.list_metric_namespaces()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of standard Azure SDK libraries and credential management is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Azure credentials using DefaultAzureCredential, which follows standard OAuth flows for Azure SDKs. It retrieves a resource URI from an environment variable, then calls the Azure Monitor API to list metric namespaces, printing their fully qualified namespace and type. All code functions align with typical Azure SDK usage. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The logic is straightforward and intended for resource monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured sample for listing Azure metric namespaces. It uses standard SDKs and practices with no suspicious or malicious intent detected.",
