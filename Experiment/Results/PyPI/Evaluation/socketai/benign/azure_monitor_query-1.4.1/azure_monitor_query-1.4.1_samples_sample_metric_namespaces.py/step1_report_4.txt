  "purpose": "Listing metric namespaces of an Azure resource using Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'METRICS_RESOURCE_URI'.",
  "sinks": "Printing metric namespace information to standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'METRICS_RESOURCE_URI' is read, passed to 'list_metric_namespaces', and output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard SDK usage. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Azure identity and monitor SDKs, sets up default Azure credentials, retrieves a resource URI from environment variables, and queries Azure Monitor for metric namespaces, printing the results. The code follows standard usage patterns with no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. It solely interacts with Azure SDK functions as intended for monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK sample for listing metric namespaces. No malicious behavior or security risks detected. The script only reads from environment variables and outputs data, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
