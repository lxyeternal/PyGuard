{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to list all metric namespaces for a specified Azure resource, using Azure SDKs and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'METRICS_RESOURCE_URI' for input; Azure SDK functions 'DefaultAzureCredential' and 'MetricsQueryClient' as API interactions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via print statements; no data is sent externally or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input (environment variable) → SDK client request → SDK response → print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code adheres to standard SDK usage and environment variable access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Azure SDK components and initializes credentials with 'DefaultAzureCredential'. It reads a resource URI from an environment variable, which is a common practice. It then calls 'list_metric_namespaces' to retrieve data and prints the results. All operations are standard API calls for resource metrics listing, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and intended for metric listing; it does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Azure monitoring sample that uses standard SDK functions and environment variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply queries and displays metric namespace data.",
