{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to list all the metric namespaces of a specified Azure resource, primarily for monitoring and management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables (METRICS_RESOURCE_URI) to obtain the resource URI for querying metrics.",
  "targets": "The code interacts with Azure services through the Azure SDK, specifically calling list_metric_namespaces on the MetricsQueryClient with the resource URI.",
  "flows": "Input source: environment variable METRICS_RESOURCE_URI -> Azure SDK method call (list_metric_namespaces) -> output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; no hardcoded secrets other than the environment variable, no unusual code constructs, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Azure SDK modules, initializes credentials with DefaultAzureCredential (which uses managed identity or environment-based credentials), and queries Azure for metric namespaces of a specified resource URI. The resource URI is obtained from an environment variable, which is a standard practice. The code performs a straightforward API call to Azure Monitor, then prints the results. There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity outside the SDK calls. It appears to be a legitimate monitoring script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure monitoring example that queries metric namespaces for a resource. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected. It simply uses Azure SDK as intended for monitoring purposes.",
