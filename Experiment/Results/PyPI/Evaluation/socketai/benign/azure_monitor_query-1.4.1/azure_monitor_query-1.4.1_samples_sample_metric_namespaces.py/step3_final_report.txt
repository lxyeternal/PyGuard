  "purpose": "This code demonstrates listing all metric namespaces of an Azure resource using the Azure SDK for Python, specifically for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'METRICS_RESOURCE_URI' which provides the resource URI; the imported modules 'azure.identity' and 'azure.monitor.query' which are used for authentication and querying metrics.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output via print statements; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The resource URI from environment variables is used as input to 'list_metric_namespaces', and the response is iterated to print namespace details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard SDK practices.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly utilizes 'DefaultAzureCredential' for authentication and calls 'list_metric_namespaces' on the provided resource URI. It reads input from environment variables, which is standard practice, and outputs the results directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable reliance is typical and does not introduce risks unless misconfigured. The code's purpose is monitoring, with no data exfiltration or malicious payloads. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for Azure SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure example of using Azure SDK to list metric namespaces. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern primarily related to environment variable handling. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, indicating a clean, straightforward script.",
