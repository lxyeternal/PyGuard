{
  "purpose": "This script queries Azure logs and visualizes the results using Plotly, specifically generating a bar chart from error operation data.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID, queries Azure Monitor Logs using Azure SDK, retrieves visualization metadata, and reads data from response tables.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visualization data as an HTML file, prints errors and response data, but does not write to or execute untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID → Azure SDK query → Response with visualization data → Plotly generates HTML visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code straightforwardly uses SDK and Plotly libraries as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, sets up Azure credentials, performs a log query, and generates a visualization with Plotly. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious data flows. It handles exceptions appropriately. All data reads and outputs are legitimate for a visualization task. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure logs visualization script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply queries logs and generates a chart using trusted libraries, with proper error handling.",
