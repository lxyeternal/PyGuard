{
  "purpose": "The script queries Azure Log Analytics data, visualizes error operations using Plotly, and outputs an HTML file with the chart.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID; Azure SDK's DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; Azure Log Analytics API response data.",
  "sinks": "HTML file 'query-visualization.html' created locally; potentially printed error messages.",
  "flows": "The workspace ID from environment variable flows into the query; query results and visualization metadata flow into Plotly for chart generation; visualization data flows into HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of environment variables is standard; no obfuscated or misleading code; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code properly uses environment variables for configuration, calls Azure SDK functions securely, and generates a visualization without executing untrusted code. The only data considered is from Azure's response, and output is limited to an HTML file and console logs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The usage of Plotly for visualization is standard and does not pose security concerns. The script handles errors gracefully and does not contain suspicious code flows or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization script using Azure SDK and Plotly. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended for visualizing Azure Log Analytics data.",
