{
  "purpose": "To query Azure logs related to errors and visualize the results using Plotly.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID, user-provided queries, Azure SDK methods for querying logs, and Plotly for visualization.",
  "sinks": "Visualization data (potentially sensitive if misused), print statements, and HTML output files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and query input → Azure SDK query execution → Visualization data processing → Plotly visualization creation and saving.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; use of environment variable is standard; visualization output is controlled by user inputs and query results.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Azure SDKs and Plotly to fetch and visualize logs. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard. The code retrieves data from Azure, then constructs and saves an HTML visualization, which appears benign. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are evident. The 'visualization' data from Azure could be sensitive, but this aligns with intended functionality. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malware-like behavior are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example for querying and visualizing Azure logs using Python. No malicious or maliciously intended code is detected. It appears to be a standard, safe data visualization script.",
