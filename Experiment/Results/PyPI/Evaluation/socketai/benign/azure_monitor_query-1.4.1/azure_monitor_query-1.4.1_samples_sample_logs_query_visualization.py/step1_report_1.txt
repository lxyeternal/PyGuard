{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes Azure Log query results using Plotly, fetching data from Azure Monitor and rendering a chart based on the query results.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID', uses Azure credentials, and executes a Kusto query via the Azure Monitor SDK.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visualization data to an HTML file and prints error messages. No data is sent over the network other than Azure API calls; no untrusted input is written to external resources.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves data from Azure Log workspace, processes the response, and generates an HTML visualization using Plotly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard SDK functions, handles exceptions, and outputs results appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, executes a predefined Kusto query to Azure Log Analytics workspace, and renders a bar chart of operations with error levels. It securely handles environment variables and API responses. No suspicious or malicious code segments, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The use of external libraries (azure and plotly) is standard for such tasks, and no hardcoded credentials are found. The flow from data retrieval to visualization is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data visualization of Azure Log Analytics results without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical application of Azure SDK and Plotly for monitoring purposes.",
