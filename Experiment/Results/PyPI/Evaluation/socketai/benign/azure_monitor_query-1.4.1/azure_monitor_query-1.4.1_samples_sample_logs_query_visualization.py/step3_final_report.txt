{
  "purpose": "This script queries Azure Log Analytics for error operations and visualizes the results using Plotly, generating an HTML report.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID', Azure SDK methods for querying workspace, response data from Azure API.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML visualization file, console output for errors and data.",
  "flows": "Query execution via Azure SDK (source) to visualization creation with Plotly (sink), with data flowing from Azure API response to HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Azure SDKs and Plotly for visualization, with proper exception handling and environment variable usage. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The visualization HTML could execute scripts if opened maliciously, but this is typical for such visualizations and not a security flaw. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the nature of HTML visualizations. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The visualization output is standard and does not pose security risks beyond inherent HTML script execution, which is acceptable. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
