{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates authenticating with Azure Monitor Logs and querying logs data from a specified workspace.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for the workspace ID; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; executes a logs query string.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console via print statements; no data sink that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> Azure SDK query call -> Response handling -> DataFrame display -> console output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; uses standard Azure SDK methods; no obfuscated code; simple query with no dynamic execution or user input manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script securely retrieves workspace ID from environment variables, authenticates using Azure's recommended credential method, and performs a straightforward logs query. Error handling is basic but appropriate. The code does not process untrusted input beyond the environment variable and does not contain malicious or suspicious constructs. There are no backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious system calls. The use of pandas and Azure SDK libraries is standard for cloud monitoring scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, straightforward example of querying Azure Monitor logs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses best practices for authentication and data retrieval. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
