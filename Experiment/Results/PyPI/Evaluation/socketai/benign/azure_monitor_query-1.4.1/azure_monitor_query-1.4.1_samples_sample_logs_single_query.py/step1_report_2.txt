{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure Monitor and queries log data from a specified workspace.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID; user inputs via environment; external libraries for Azure credentials and query execution.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieved from Azure Monitor logs; potential output via pandas DataFrame and print statements.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> credential creation -> client query -> response handling -> data processing and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of environment variables is standard for credentials. No obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDKs to authenticate and perform a logs query. It handles success and error responses appropriately. No data exfiltration, command execution, or suspicious behaviors are detected. External dependencies are used for legitimate cloud monitoring purposes. The code reads input from environment variables, which is typical, and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No anomalies in control flow or data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate example for querying Azure Monitor logs. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It follows typical patterns for cloud log querying without any security concerns.",
