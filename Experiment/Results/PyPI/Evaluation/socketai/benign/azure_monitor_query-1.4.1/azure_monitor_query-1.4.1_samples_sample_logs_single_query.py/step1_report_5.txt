{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure Monitor using DefaultAzureCredential and performs a logs query to retrieve and display data from a specified workspace.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' used for workspace identification, Azure SDK methods for querying logs, standard input/output for displaying results.",
  "sinks": "Printing errors and DataFrames to standard output; no data leakage or untrusted sink interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' (source) flows into the 'query_workspace' function; response data (potentially untrusted) flows into data processing and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; usage of environment variables and SDK functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script uses environment variables for workspace ID, which is common practice. It employs Azure SDKs and pandas for data handling, with proper exception handling for HTTP errors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious data flows detected. The code appears to be a legitimate sample demonstrating Azure logs query functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of querying Azure Monitor logs using Python SDK. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. It follows typical patterns for cloud service interaction with proper exception handling.",
