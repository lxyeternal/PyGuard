  "purpose": "This code demonstrates authenticating with Azure Monitor Logs using DefaultAzureCredential and querying a specific log table, then displaying the results with pandas.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID', Azure SDK functions, pandas DataFrame creation",
  "sinks": "Printing the DataFrame to standard output",
  "flows": "Credential initialization -> query execution -> response handling -> DataFrame display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDK patterns for querying logs, with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration. The pandas library is used solely for data display, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of querying Azure logs with no malicious intent or security risks. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
