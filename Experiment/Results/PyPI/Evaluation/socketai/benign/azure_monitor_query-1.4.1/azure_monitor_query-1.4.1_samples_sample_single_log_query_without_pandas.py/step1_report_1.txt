  "purpose": "This script authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, queries Azure Monitor logs, and prints the results without using pandas.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' for workspace ID, and uses Azure SDK to perform a log query.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data directly to the console via print statements; no data is stored or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' → Azure SDK query → response data → console output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The use of environment variables and Azure SDK is standard for cloud interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an Azure log query after authenticating via DefaultAzureCredential. It handles successful and partial/error responses explicitly and prints results to the console. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. The code appears to be a standard example or utility script for querying logs securely. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured script for querying Azure logs. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply reads environment variables, authenticates, and outputs logs. No issues or suspicious activity are detected.",
