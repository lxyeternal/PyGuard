  "purpose": "Authenticate with Azure Monitor Logs, query logs from a specified workspace, and display the results without using pandas.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID for workspace ID, user environment variables for credentials, and external Azure SDK libraries for querying logs.",
  "sinks": "Outputting query errors and data to the console.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID -> client.query_workspace -> response handling -> printing data and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of environment variables and Azure SDK is standard for cloud service interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code securely authenticates using DefaultAzureCredential, avoiding hardcoded credentials. It performs a straightforward query to Azure Log Analytics workspace, handling success and error responses appropriately. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are present. It does not perform any file I/O beyond standard print statements, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The use of standard SDKs and environment variables aligns with typical cloud application practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a normal, well-structured example of querying Azure Log Analytics, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs secure authentication and handles responses properly. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
