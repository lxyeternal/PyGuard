  "purpose": "Authenticate and query logs from Azure Monitor workspace without using pandas.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID, Azure credential (DefaultAzureCredential), the query string \"AppRequests | take 5\".",
  "sinks": "Printing error messages and query results to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID (source) → client.query_workspace (sink), query response → data processing and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no unusual code, no obfuscated code. Standard usage of Azure SDK, no suspicious data handling or network activity beyond legitimate API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Azure SDK to authenticate and query logs. It reads the workspace ID from environment variables, which is standard practice. The query is a simple log query. The response handling checks for success or partial error and prints data accordingly. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No data exfiltration, network connections beyond Azure API, or malicious code identified. The code structure and imports are typical for such scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, legitimate Azure log query sample with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and does not include any malicious or suspicious code.",
