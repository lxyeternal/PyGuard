{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure Monitor and performs a log query on a specified workspace to retrieve recent application request data.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' used to obtain the workspace ID; input parameters for the query; response data from Azure SDK.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print statements; no data sink that stores or transmits untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable -> query execution -> response handling -> printing data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; usage of standard Azure SDK practices; no suspicious or obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for input, employs Azure SDK for querying logs, and outputs results directly to the console. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The exception handling captures HTTP errors and prints messages. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with common practices for Azure log querying. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard log query operation with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly uses environment variables, handles errors gracefully, and outputs results directly. No malicious intent or security compromise detected.",
