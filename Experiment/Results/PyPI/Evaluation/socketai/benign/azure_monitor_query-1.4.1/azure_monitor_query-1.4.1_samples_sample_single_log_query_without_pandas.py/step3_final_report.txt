  "purpose": "This code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, queries logs from Azure Monitor workspace specified by environment variable, and prints the results.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID, azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential, azure.monitor.query client.query_workspace method",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> client.query_workspace -> response handling -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDK practices for log querying, handles responses appropriately, and outputs data. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code is straightforward, with environment variables used securely for configuration. The response handling covers success and partial/error states, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Azure log query utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
