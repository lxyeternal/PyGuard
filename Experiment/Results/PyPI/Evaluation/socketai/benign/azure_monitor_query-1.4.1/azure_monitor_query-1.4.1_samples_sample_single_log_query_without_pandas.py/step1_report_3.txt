{
  "purpose": "To authenticate and query logs from Azure Monitor workspace without using pandas, demonstrating usage of Azure SDKs and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID', Azure credential acquisition via DefaultAzureCredential, and the client.query_workspace method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; print statements output query results and errors, but do not send or store untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID' flows into client.query_workspace, and response data is processed and printed; error handling outputs errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. Use of standard Azure SDK patterns; no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code authenticates using Azure's DefaultAzureCredential, which is standard and secure, and queries Azure Monitor logs. It processes the response and outputs data and errors. No code indicates malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or hidden functionalities are detected. The logic follows typical usage patterns for Azure SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, legitimate example of querying Azure Monitor logs using Python. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior and poses no security threat.",
