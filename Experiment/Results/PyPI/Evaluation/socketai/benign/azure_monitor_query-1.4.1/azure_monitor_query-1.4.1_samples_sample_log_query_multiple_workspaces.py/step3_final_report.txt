{
  "purpose": "This code authenticates with Azure Log Analytics using DefaultAzureCredential, queries logs from multiple workspaces specified via environment variables, and outputs the results using pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Environment variables LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID and SECONDARY_WORKSPACE_ID for workspace IDs; the Azure SDKs for authentication and querying; pandas for data output.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the DataFrame, which could potentially expose sensitive log data if logs contain confidential information.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide workspace IDs -> Azure SDK query functions retrieve logs -> pandas DataFrame processes data -> print outputs data to console.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, suspicious logic, or malicious network activity. Usage of environment variables is standard. The only potential anomaly is data leakage via printed logs, but this is typical in sample scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for Azure SDK usage, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. It handles exceptions appropriately. The data flow is straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The low security risk score (0.1-0.2) is justified due to potential data exposure if logs contain sensitive info. Malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The code's structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example of querying Azure Log Analytics across multiple workspaces. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The minor risk pertains to potential data leakage through printed logs, which is typical for such scripts but not a security flaw.",
