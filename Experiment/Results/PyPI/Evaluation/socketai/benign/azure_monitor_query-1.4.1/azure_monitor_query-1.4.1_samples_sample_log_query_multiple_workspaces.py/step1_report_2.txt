{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential to query logs from multiple Azure Monitor workspaces and prints the results using pandas.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID and SECONDARY_WORKSPACE_ID for workspace IDs; reads data from client.query_workspace() call.",
  "sinks": "Outputs dataframes to console; no other data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → query parameters; query execution → data returned → pandas DataFrame → printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious data manipulation; usage of standard Azure SDK functions; no obfuscation or unusual language features; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDKs and pandas to perform a logs query across multiple workspaces with environment variables providing workspace IDs. It includes error handling for HTTP response errors. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The data flow is limited to querying and printing; no data exfiltration, network communication beyond Azure SDK, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for querying Azure Monitor logs across multiple workspaces. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign example script for educational purposes.",
