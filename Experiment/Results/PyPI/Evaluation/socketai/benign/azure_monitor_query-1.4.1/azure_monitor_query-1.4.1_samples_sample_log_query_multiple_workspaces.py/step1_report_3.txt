{
  "purpose": "Authenticate and query logs from multiple Azure Log Analytics workspaces using the LogsQueryClient.",
  "sources": "Environment variables LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID and SECONDARY_WORKSPACE_ID, os.environ for environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data frames to the console, which could be a source of information leakage if sensitive data is in logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → client.query_workspace → response processing → print to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of standard Azure SDK components; no suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script authenticates using DefaultAzureCredential, which is a standard practice. It reads workspace IDs from environment variables, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The code queries logs from Azure Log Analytics workspaces and outputs the results using pandas DataFrame. The process involves standard SDK functions and typical data handling. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The only potential concern could be leaking log data if the output is improperly protected, but that is outside the scope of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate operations for querying Azure Log Analytics workspaces without signs of malicious intent. It uses standard SDKs and patterns with no suspicious behavior. No malware or malicious activities are detected.",
