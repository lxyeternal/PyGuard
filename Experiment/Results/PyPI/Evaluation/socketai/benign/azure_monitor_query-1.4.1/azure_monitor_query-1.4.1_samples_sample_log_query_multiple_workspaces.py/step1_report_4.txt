{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential and queries logs from multiple Azure Monitor workspaces, printing the results using pandas.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID and SECONDARY_WORKSPACE_ID; imports from azure libraries; reads data from response.tables",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if environment variables contain sensitive IDs; outputs data to console (print)",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Azure SDK query -> pandas DataFrame -> print to console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; usage of environment variables is standard; no suspicious code or backdoors; exception handling is minimal but normal",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Azure SDK libraries with typical credential flow. It reads workspace IDs from environment variables, performs a log query on multiple workspaces, and outputs the result using pandas. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling. The exception handling simply prints errors without exfiltration or malicious activity. Overall, the code performs legitimate operations without security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure log querying script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses environment variables for configuration and outputs data to the console. No malicious or suspicious code segments are present.",
