{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to query Azure Monitor logs with a specified server timeout, primarily for fetching log data from a workspace.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID; uses DefaultAzureCredential for authentication; reads query parameters and response data from Azure SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements; does not write or send data elsewhere; no untrusted data sink identified that would lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable input -> Authentication via DefaultAzureCredential -> Query execution with server_timeout -> Response handling -> Data presentation via pandas DataFrame and print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The query string appears to be a standard log query. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets up Azure credentials, constructs a log query with a long server timeout, executes the query, handles responses, and prints data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs legitimate log querying and data display without any hidden or malicious actions. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example for querying Azure logs with a configurable timeout. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It uses Azure SDKs appropriately and handles errors safely.",
