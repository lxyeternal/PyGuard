  "purpose": "This script demonstrates how to update a server timeout for a long-running query in Azure Monitor using Python.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID, default credential acquisition via DefaultAzureCredential",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions",
  "flows": "Credential is used to authenticate requests; the query is sent to Azure Monitor; response is processed and printed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; query string appears to be standard; no suspicious code or backdoors; no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential, which is standard and secure. It constructs a long-running query and sets a server timeout explicitly. The query itself is a simple range count, not malicious. The code handles exceptions properly. No untrusted data input besides environment variables, which are standard. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The pandas library is used only for data display. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with its purpose of demonstrating timeout configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate example of configuring a server timeout for Azure Log queries. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely uses environment variables and standard libraries without any malicious or obfuscated code.",
