{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure and queries storage resource metrics (Ingress) over a specified timespan.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'AZURE_METRICS_ENDPOINT' for the endpoint URL.",
  "sinks": "Outputs metric data to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'AZURE_METRICS_ENDPOINT' -> MetricsClient query -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than environment variables; no suspicious or obfuscated code; straightforward use of SDK. No suspicious data flows or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves an endpoint URL from environment variables, which is a common and acceptable pattern. It uses Azure SDKs to authenticate and query metrics data for specified resources. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no malicious API calls are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs a standard metric query operation without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of Azure metrics querying without malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior; it performs standard SDK operations for monitoring purposes.",
