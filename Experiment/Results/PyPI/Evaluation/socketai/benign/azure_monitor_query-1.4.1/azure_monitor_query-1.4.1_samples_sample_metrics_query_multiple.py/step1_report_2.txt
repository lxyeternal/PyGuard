{
  "purpose": "This code authenticates with Azure, queries metrics data for specified storage accounts, and prints the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'AZURE_METRICS_ENDPOINT' for the endpoint URL and uses input parameters for resource IDs and metric names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code reads environment variables and input parameters, then performs a network request to Azure's metrics API, and outputs data to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of environment variables and SDK functions are standard for Azure SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly uses environment variables for configuration, employs Azure SDK functions to query metrics, and handles exceptions with appropriate error logging. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling observed. The data flow appears legitimate for monitoring purposes. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration mechanisms, or malicious payloads. It is a typical usage example of Azure monitoring SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of querying Azure metrics data. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It functions as intended for monitoring storage account metrics without any suspicious or malicious code components.",
