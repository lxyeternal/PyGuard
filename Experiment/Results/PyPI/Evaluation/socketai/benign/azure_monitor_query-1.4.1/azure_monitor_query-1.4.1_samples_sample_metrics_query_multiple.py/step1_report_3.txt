{
  "purpose": "The code authenticates with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential and queries metrics data for specified storage accounts over a 2-hour period.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'AZURE_METRICS_ENDPOINT' to obtain the metrics endpoint URL.",
  "sinks": "The code prints metric data and error messages to the console; no data is written to external locations or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variable input (endpoint), through Azure SDK methods, to console output; no untrusted data flows to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; environment variable use is standard. No unusual data flows or code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Azure SDK operations: it reads configuration from environment variables, authenticates with Azure via DefaultAzureCredential, and retrieves metrics data for specified resources. The code uses standard libraries and practices without any obfuscation or malicious constructs. It handles exceptions and prints output; no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Azure metrics query script with no indications of malicious behavior. It securely retrieves and displays metrics data as intended. No malicious or sabotage indicators are present.",
