{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup for the 'mmhash2' library, including C++ extension modules and data files.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially dangerous operations such as network communication, file writing, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely declarative setup instructions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, standard setup for a C++ extension module; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' for package setup, defines metadata, and specifies extension modules with source files. No user input handling, no network operations, and no credential management are present. The long description contains usage examples and attribution, typical for open-source packages. The data files include header files for the C++ extension. Overall, this is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Python package setup script for a C++ extension module, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
