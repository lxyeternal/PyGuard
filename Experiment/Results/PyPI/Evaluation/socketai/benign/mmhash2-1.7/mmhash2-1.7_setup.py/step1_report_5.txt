{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'mmhash2' that provides a C++ extension module implementing MurmurHash2 hash functions for Python 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads source files for the C++ extension ('murmurhash/CMurmurhash.cpp', 'mmhash2.cpp') and a header file ('murmurhash/CMurmurhash.hpp') from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or inputs are processed at runtime; the setup script primarily loads local source files and metadata without external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading source files and metadata to constructing the extension module for building the package; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly handles setup configuration and local source inclusion without any obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and Extension from distutils.core to define a package. It specifies package metadata and includes source files for a C++ extension module, along with a data file (header). The code appears straightforward, serving as a standard setup script for a Python extension module. No input validation, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The comments describe the purpose and usage of the hash functions but do not include any suspicious or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a C++ extension module for Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No malware or security risks are evident.",
