{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for building and installing a Python package called 'mmhash2' that wraps C++ code implementing MurmurHash2 hash functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'sources' parameter listing C++ source files ('murmurhash/CMurmurhash.cpp', 'mmhash2.cpp') and a header file ('murmurhash/CMurmurhash.hpp') specified in 'data_files'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks related to untrusted data or external communication in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing 'setup' and 'Extension', defining module sources, and package metadata. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present. The code strictly handles package build configuration with no runtime malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging modules to configure a C++ extension build for a Python package. All elements, including source files, data files, and metadata, appear typical for a C++ extension package. No suspicious or malicious constructs, such as network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration, are evident. The code is straightforward, focused solely on package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension module with C++ sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration for MurmurHash2 bindings.",
