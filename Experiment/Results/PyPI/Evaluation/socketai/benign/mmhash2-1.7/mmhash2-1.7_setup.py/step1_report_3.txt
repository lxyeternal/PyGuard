  "purpose": "Setup script for building the mmhash2 Python extension module with associated header files.",
  "sources": "Read from 'murmurhash/CMurmurhash.hpp', list of source files ['murmurhash/CMurmurhash.cpp', 'mmhash2.cpp'], and data_files specifying header inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing, network I/O, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. Use of standard setup tools with C++ extension compilation is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for compiling a C++ extension module 'mmhash2' for Python. It specifies source files and header files, along with descriptive documentation. There are no code injections, no network operations, nor any indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate build script for a hashing library, with no hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script for compiling a C++ extension module. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. The code's purpose is straightforward—building a hashing extension for Python with no apparent security risks.",
