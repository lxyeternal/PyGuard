  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python setup script for building a C++ extension module, with no user input, network operations, or dynamic behavior.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The source files are local C++ sources and headers, with no external or untrusted data processing.\n- The long description is purely informational and does not contain any malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code does exactly what a setup script for a C++ extension module should do.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; no external data, no network, no runtime code execution, no credentials.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any deviations?** No, the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- The code is purely declarative, for package setup.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The long description, source files, and data files are all standard for such a package.\n- No assumptions are made about hidden malicious code, as none exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard setup script for a C++ extension module in Python. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
