  "purpose": "A setup script for building the 'mmhash2' Python extension module using C++ sources, intended to compile MurmurHash2 hashing functions.",
  "sources": "Local source files 'murmurhash/CMurmurhash.cpp', 'mmhash2.cpp'; header 'murmurhash/CMurmurhash.hpp'; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute runtime code beyond compilation.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only defines build parameters, with no data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a standard setup script with clear structure, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script utilizing distutils to compile a C++ extension module. It specifies source files and headers for building MurmurHash2 functions. No runtime input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The long description contains usage examples but no malicious content. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's purpose. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script for a C++ extension module implementing MurmurHash2. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
