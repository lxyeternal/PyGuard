  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Python setup script for building a C++ extension module named 'mmhash2'.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or data sinks are present.\n- The source files and header files are standard and local.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to compile and install a hashing library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious content.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  **Yes.** No malicious behavior or payloads are present.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **No.** All claims are supported by the code analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the report?**  \n  **Yes.** All are uniformly indicating no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- The code is purely a package setup script; it does not execute any runtime code beyond importing modules and defining metadata.\n- The source files are local C++ files for a hashing extension, with no indication of malicious content.\n- The long description contains usage examples, typical for open-source documentation.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python C++ extension module implementing MurmurHash2. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
