{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes to build and generate query strings for the Fortify API, allowing flexible composition of search conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters 'name' and 'value' passed to 'query', 'and_query', and 'or_query' methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'generate' method constructs a query string by concatenating string representations of conditions; no direct data leak sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Condition objects ('name' and 'value'), which are then converted to strings and concatenated in 'generate' to produce a query string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code dynamically constructs query strings without apparent sanitization or validation.",
  "analysis": "The classes define a structure for constructing query strings with logical operators. Input data flows from method parameters into string concatenation without sanitization, but there is no evidence of malicious intent such as executing untrusted input as code or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, primarily string handling, with no obfuscated code or suspicious external calls. Overall, it appears to be a utility for query building with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign query string builder for the Fortify API, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or leak sensitive data.",
