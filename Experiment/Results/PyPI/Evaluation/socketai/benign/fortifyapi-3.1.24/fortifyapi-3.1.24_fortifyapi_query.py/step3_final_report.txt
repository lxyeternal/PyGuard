  "purpose": "Constructs query strings for the Fortify API with support for chained conditions and logical operators.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'name' and 'value' in query, and optional initial query_obj dictionary",
  "sinks": "String concatenation in generate() method, used to produce the final query string",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Condition objects -> string representations -> concatenation in generate() -> output query string",
  "anomalies": "No input sanitization or validation; direct string formatting of user inputs without escaping or validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for building query strings with conditions combined via logical operators. It uses straightforward string concatenation without sanitization, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious and downstream systems interpret the query insecurely. No obfuscation, external calls, or malicious code are present. The code is transparent and simple, with no errors or hidden behaviors. The security risk is minimal but exists if inputs are used insecurely outside this code. The malware score is zero, as there's no malicious intent or behavior. The obfuscation score is zero, given the clear structure. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but not inherent maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward query builder with no malicious or obfuscated components. The primary concern is the lack of input sanitization, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities if used improperly downstream. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe within its scope, with a minor security consideration regarding external input handling.",
