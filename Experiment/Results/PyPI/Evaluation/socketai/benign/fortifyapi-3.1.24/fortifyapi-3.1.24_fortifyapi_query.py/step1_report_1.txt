{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for constructing query strings for a Fortify API, allowing composition of logical conditions and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are method parameters: 'name' and 'value' in query, and_query, or_query methods; initial query_obj dictionary in constructor.",
  "sinks": "Generated query string in generate() and __str__() methods, which outputs a concatenated string potentially used in API requests or URLs.",
  "flows": "Input values ('name' and 'value') are stored in condition objects, which are converted to strings and concatenated in generate(), forming a query string that may be used in API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard string formatting and class inheritance without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs query strings from input parameters, allowing flexible combination of conditions with logical operators. All inputs are handled as strings or simple data, with no evident dynamic code execution, system commands, or external data leaks. The input values could be malicious if used maliciously in downstream systems, but within this code, they are simply concatenated into strings. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Overall, the implementation appears safe and intended for query string generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward query builder for API requests with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It safely constructs query strings based on provided parameters without any signs of malware or security risks.",
