{
  "purpose": "This code constructs query strings for the Fortify API, allowing chaining of query conditions with logical operators.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the constructor (query_obj parameter) and methods query(), and_query(), or_query().",
  "sinks": "The generated query string is returned by generate() and __str__(), which could be used in HTTP requests or logs. No direct sink of untrusted data into dangerous operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from query_obj, method parameters, and chained calls into query condition objects, which are converted into string components and concatenated into a query string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is straightforward string concatenation for query construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for query conditions, supporting chaining to build complex queries. It converts input parameters into formatted strings, assembling them into a query string. No external data manipulation, unsafe evaluation, or code injection mechanisms are present. The use of string formatting appears safe given the context, assuming the input data is properly sanitized or validated externally. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate query builder for the Fortify API with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It constructs query strings from provided inputs in a controlled manner. The risk of malicious activity is very low.",
