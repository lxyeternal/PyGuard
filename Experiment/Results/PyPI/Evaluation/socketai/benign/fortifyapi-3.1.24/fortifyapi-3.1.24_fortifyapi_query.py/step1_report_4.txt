{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes to build and generate query strings for the Fortify API, allowing chaining of query conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters in the 'query', 'and_query', and 'or_query' methods, typically user-provided key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "Generated query string output; potential for injection if user input is maliciously crafted and not sanitized.",
  "flows": "User provides key-value inputs → These are added as conditions → Conditions are converted to strings → Concatenated into a query string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious external calls or data leaks are observed. The code appears to only generate query strings based on input.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs query strings by appending user-supplied key-value pairs into a formatted string, with support for chaining multiple conditions using logical operators. It relies on the string representations of conditions but does not perform any sanitization or validation of input data. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent within this code fragment. The structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or hidden functionality is present. The code could potentially be used to generate malicious queries if user input is maliciously crafted, but this depends on external usage context, which is outside this code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward query builder for the Fortify API. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malware. The only security consideration is the risk of injection if the input data is maliciously crafted and the query string is used in insecure contexts downstream. Overall, it appears safe within the provided scope.",
