  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward query builder with no malicious or obfuscated components. The primary concern is the lack of input sanitization, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities if used improperly downstream. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe within its scope, with a minor security consideration regarding external input handling."
