{
  "purpose": "The code constructs query strings for the Fortify API by allowing dynamic composition of key-value conditions with logical operators.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the query(), and_query(), or_query() methods; values passed to these methods.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation in generate() and __str__() methods which output the final query string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided input (via method arguments) into conditions and then into the final query string output.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the values; it simply formats and concatenates them into strings. No evident obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The classes create a structured way to generate query strings with logical operators. The query parameters are stored as objects and converted into strings. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. It does not evaluate or execute the values, nor does it perform any data leaks or malicious actions. The string formatting is straightforward, and no unsafe operations are present. The lack of input sanitization could be a concern if the output string is used unsafely elsewhere, but within this code, there is no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign query string builder for API requests with no evident malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It could be misused if user input is not sanitized before use, but the code itself is safe.",
