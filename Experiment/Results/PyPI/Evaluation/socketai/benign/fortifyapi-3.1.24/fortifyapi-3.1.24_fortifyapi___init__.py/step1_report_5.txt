{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module metadata and import specific classes/functions from the 'fortifyapi' package for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fortifyapi.client' and 'fortifyapi.query'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as data output, network communication, or system modification present in this fragment",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the namespace, but no untrusted data handling or processing is shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code detected; only standard import and metadata assignment",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, imports specific components from the 'fortifyapi' package, and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. The imports are from a presumably legitimate API library, and the structure is typical for Python modules. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or malicious code present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports classes/functions and defines module exports.",
