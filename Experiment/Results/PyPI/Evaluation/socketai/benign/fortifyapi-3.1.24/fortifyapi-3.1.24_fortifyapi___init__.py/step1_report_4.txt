{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to the Fortify API client, likely for security testing or integration purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fortifyapi.client' and 'fortifyapi.query', and the setting of a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing are evident; the code mainly defines module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output are present; the code simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns are present. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from 'fortifyapi', which suggests reliance on external packages. It sets a version string and defines the public API via '__all__'. There are no runtime data processing, no dynamic execution, and no evident malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple module definition file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no malicious behavior detected. It imports and re-exports components for the Fortify API client, with no security concerns observed.",
