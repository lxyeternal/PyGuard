  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward module setup:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = '3.1.24'\n\n     from fortifyapi.client import *\n     from fortifyapi.query import Query\n\n     __all__ = ['FortifySSCAPI', 'FortifySSCClient', 'Query', 'fortify', '__version__']\n     ```\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, no user input handling, and no suspicious code constructs.\n   - The import statements are static, and the code simply defines a version string and exports symbols.\n   - Based on the code snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Any High Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since all reports assign a malware score of 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, this is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious.\n   - The 'fortifyapi' package could contain sensitive functions, but their mere import does not imply malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made in the reports.\n   - The assessments are based solely on static code analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent: no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n   - The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the code itself is benign, it relies on the 'fortifyapi' package. If that package contains malicious code, the risk could be external to this snippet.\n- However, based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization pattern.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence at hand.",
