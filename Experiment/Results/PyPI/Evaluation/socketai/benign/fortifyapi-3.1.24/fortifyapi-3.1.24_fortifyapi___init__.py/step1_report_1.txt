{
  "purpose": "Define module version and import specific classes and functions from the 'fortifyapi' package for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'fortifyapi.client' and 'fortifyapi.query', and setting the '__all__' list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; import statements are static and do not process input.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; there are no runtime data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, imports modules from 'fortifyapi', and defines an '__all__' export list. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or user input processing. The import statements and the version declaration are common and benign. The 'fortifyapi' package may contain sensitive or security-related functions, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious behavior in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply imports components from an external library and defines exports. No suspicious behavior or malware indications are present.",
