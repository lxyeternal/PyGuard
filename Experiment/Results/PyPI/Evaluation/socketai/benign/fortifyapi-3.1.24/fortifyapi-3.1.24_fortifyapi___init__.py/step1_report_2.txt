{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports and import components from the 'fortifyapi' library, likely for interacting with Fortify security analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fortifyapi.client' and 'fortifyapi.query' modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a version string, imports specific modules and classes, and sets the module's exported symbols. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is present. The imported modules could contain malicious code, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The structure and content are typical for a library initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization snippet with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It imports and exposes certain classes and functions from the 'fortifyapi' package without any suspicious patterns.",
