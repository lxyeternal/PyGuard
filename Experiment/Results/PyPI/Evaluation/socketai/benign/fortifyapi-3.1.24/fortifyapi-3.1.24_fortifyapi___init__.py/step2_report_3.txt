  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initialization: defining a version string, importing from 'fortifyapi', and setting an __all__ list.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or data flows involving untrusted input.\n- The 'malware' scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusions are appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)?**  \n  All are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. The code is purely import and export declarations, with no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk or vulnerability is indicated.\n\n### Any assumptions or potential vulnerabilities?  \n- The reports assume that the 'fortifyapi' package is trustworthy. While this is reasonable, in a real scenario, the package's integrity should be verified separately.\n- The code itself does not process data, handle secrets, or perform dynamic actions, so no vulnerabilities are apparent here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns based on this fragment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a standard, benign module initialization code with no malware or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
