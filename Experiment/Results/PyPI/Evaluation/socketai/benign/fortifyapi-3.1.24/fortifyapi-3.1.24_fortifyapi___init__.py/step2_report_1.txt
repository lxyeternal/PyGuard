  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code declares a version string (`__version__ = '3.1.24'`).\n   - It imports modules from `fortifyapi.client` and `fortifyapi.query`.\n   - It defines an `__all__` list to specify public symbols.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and lacks dynamic behavior.\n   - No evidence of data handling, user input processing, or external communication.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The imports are static and do not process untrusted data.\n\n3. **Potential Risks and Security Concerns**:\n   - The only external dependency is `fortifyapi`, which could contain sensitive or security-related functions, but this is not evidenced here.\n   - The code itself does not perform any risky operations, nor does it execute code dynamically.\n   - The version string is benign and typical for module metadata.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is a typical module setup for an SDK or library, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - While the code itself is safe, one should ensure that the `fortifyapi` package, when used, does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities. However, this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
