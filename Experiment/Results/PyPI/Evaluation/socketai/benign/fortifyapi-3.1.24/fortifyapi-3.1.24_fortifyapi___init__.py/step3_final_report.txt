  "purpose": "Module initialization and symbol exports for the 'fortifyapi' package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'fortifyapi.client' and 'fortifyapi.query'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports without data processing or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, imports modules statically, and sets an __all__ list. No dynamic behavior, data handling, or external communication is present. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
