{
  "purpose": "The script automates the setup and publishing process for the 'fortifyapi' Python package, including build, tag, and upload commands, as well as package metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Input sources include sys.argv for command-line arguments and the 'README.rst' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system() commands that perform build, tagging, and upload operations based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) trigger corresponding os.system() calls for build, tag, and publish operations, potentially executing shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with command strings directly derived from command-line arguments, which could potentially be manipulated if inputs are not sanitized, though in this context, inputs are fixed commands. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages packaging and deployment workflows with conditional checks on sys.argv. It reads a README file for long description and uses standard setup tools. The commands executed via os.system() are standard for build and publish tasks. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The commands are static and related to package management functions. The script does not process or execute untrusted data or code beyond predefined commands.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs typical package setup and deployment tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It uses standard tools and practices, and there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate build script with no malicious intent.",
