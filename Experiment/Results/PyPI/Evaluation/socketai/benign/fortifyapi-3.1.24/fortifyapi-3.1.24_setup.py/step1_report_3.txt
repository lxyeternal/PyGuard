{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fortifyapi' Python package, handling installation, versioning, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file, command-line arguments, and environment variables related to version.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to execute shell commands for building, tagging, and publishing the package.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments trigger os.system() calls which execute potentially external commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with arguments constructed from version and command-line input, but only with controlled inputs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file and checks command-line arguments to execute build, tag, or publish commands via os.system(). No user input is directly passed into system calls outside predefined commands. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are present. The commands executed are standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious network activity. Use of os.system() with controlled arguments does not appear malicious, although it could be improved for security by replacing with subprocess module, but this is a benign pattern in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging and publishing a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of os.system() is controlled and only executes predictable commands related to package management.",
