{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'fortifyapi' Python package, facilitating packaging, publishing, tagging, and installation procedures.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file; obtaining the version from 'fortifyapi'; command-line arguments for build, tag, publish-test, publish; environment variables (implicitly via os.system commands).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing shell commands for build, tag, publish, and version tagging.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument checks trigger corresponding os.system calls which execute shell commands involving version info and git commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute shell commands based on command-line arguments; potential injection if arguments or version string are manipulated, but in this context, version is imported from a trusted module. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs setup and deployment tasks for a Python package. It reads package information and invokes system commands for building, tagging, and publishing. The use of os.system based on argv is typical for such scripts, with no evident malicious intent. The version info is imported from a local module, reducing risk of injection. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks identified. The code does not perform any network activity beyond invoking standard commands and does not handle sensitive data explicitly.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup utility for package distribution. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of os.system is acceptable in this context, given the controlled environment and reliance on trusted inputs. Overall security risk is minimal.",
