  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and publishing the 'fortifyapi' Python library, including build, tag, and publish commands.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, os.system for executing shell commands, and file read operation for README.rst.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing potentially sensitive commands like git tagging, publishing to PyPI, and building distributions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sources) trigger os.system commands (sinks) to perform publishing, tagging, and building operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with string interpolation for commands, which could potentially be manipulated if sys.argv is malicious. No input validation is present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations with conditional commands for building, tagging, and publishing. The use of os.system with string interpolation based on sys.argv is a minor concern, but since these commands are standard and not involving untrusted user input beyond command parameters, it poses minimal risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical of setup scripts, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging and publishing a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or malware, but the use of os.system with sys.argv parameters warrants caution if manipulated externally. Overall, the code appears safe with a low malware score.",
