{
  "purpose": "A Python class-based client library for interacting with Fortify SSC APIs, handling various project, artifact, token, and configuration management operations.",
  "sources": "User input via method parameters, environment variables for credentials (not explicitly shown), external HTTP requests via the 'requests' library, file system access for reading files to upload.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request functions (`requests.request`) that send data, including JSON payloads and files; headers including authorization tokens; responses processed into JSON or raw data; file write operations in example usage.",
  "flows": "Inputs from method parameters (e.g., URLs, JSON data, files) flow into request payloads and headers; these are transmitted over network via 'requests'; responses are received, parsed as JSON or raw bytes, and returned or used in further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language constructs. No visible backdoors, hidden network connections, or data exfiltration. The code properly manages SSL verification settings. File uploads are performed with token retrieval but no suspicious file handling. Error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a client SDK for Fortify SSC, with multiple API interaction methods. It manages authentication via tokens or basic auth, performs file uploads/downloads, and handles various project and artifact data. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident. All request handling relies on standard 'requests' library calls, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious data leakage, code injection, or covert communication are present. The code includes typical functionality for a SDK, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client library for interacting with Fortify SSC, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for API interaction, token management, and file handling without any suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
