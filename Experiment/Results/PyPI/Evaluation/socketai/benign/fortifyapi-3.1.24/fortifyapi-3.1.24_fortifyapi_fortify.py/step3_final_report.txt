{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python SDK client for Fortify SSC, facilitating project, artifact, token, rule, and configuration management via REST API calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, environment variables, HTTP request responses, file system operations (open/read/write).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to Fortify SSC endpoints, file uploads/downloads, network responses parsed into JSON or raw data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request payloads and URL parameters; responses are parsed into JSON objects or raw bytes for file content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; use of open() without explicit closure is present but typical; no backdoors or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK wrapping REST API calls for Fortify SSC. It manages authentication via tokens or basic auth, handles SSL verification, and performs file operations for uploads/downloads. No malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is standard, and the code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The resource management practices are typical for such SDKs, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, clean SDK client for Fortify SSC with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Its low security risk score (~0.2) reflects standard operational concerns but no actual threats.",
