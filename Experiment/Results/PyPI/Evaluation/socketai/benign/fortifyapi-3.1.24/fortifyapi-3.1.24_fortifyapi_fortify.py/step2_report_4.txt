  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a class-based Python client for Fortify SSC APIs, managing projects, artifacts, tokens, etc.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** User input, environment variables, HTTP requests, file system.\n- **Flows:** Data from inputs flows into requests; responses parsed into JSON or raw data.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code functions as a legitimate SDK, with standard API interactions, proper error handling, and no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough and consistent. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides a Python API client for Fortify SSC, facilitating project, artifact, token, and issue management.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Inputs via parameters, outputs via HTTP requests, file uploads.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from inputs into network requests; responses parsed into objects.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; standard request handling; minor concern about open() usage but typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and thorough. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** API client for Fortify SSC, managing projects, artifacts, rules, tokens, etc.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Inputs from parameters, outputs via requests; file operations involved.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of open() without explicit sanitization; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Well-structured, legitimate, no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Client for Fortify SSC, managing projects, artifacts, rules, tokens.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Inputs from parameters, network requests, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of open() without validation, but typical; no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate client, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** API client for Fortify SSC, managing resources via REST.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Inputs from parameters, API responses, file uploads.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; open() used but not malicious; no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate API client SDK for Fortify SSC.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero, but very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical concerns about file handling and network requests, but nothing malicious.\n\n### **Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.15 — low, typical for an API client with file operations and network communication, but no actual security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for Fortify SSC with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate given the operations involved.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed; the current scores are justified and consistent with the detailed analyses.",
