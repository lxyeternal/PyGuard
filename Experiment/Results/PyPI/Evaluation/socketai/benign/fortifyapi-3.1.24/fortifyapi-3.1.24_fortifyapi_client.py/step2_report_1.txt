  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client library for Fortify SSC API, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code detected. It handles API interactions, file uploads, token management, etc. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malware signs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for an API client, with no signs of malicious behavior. The low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and placeholder methods are benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. No suspicious elements or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code wraps API endpoints for SSC resources. Noted placeholder methods with unimplemented logic, but these are not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The file token deletion method is untested and has an assertion that always fails, but this is likely a stub.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. The untested or placeholder methods are typical during development and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate client library, with no signs of malicious behavior. Some incomplete functions are noted, but they are benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with previous reports. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity. Placeholder methods are benign. The 'delete' method in FileToken has an assertion that always fails, likely a stub.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, citing no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. This is appropriate given the code's nature as an API client.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable; no obfuscation patterns are present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting low security risk—mainly due to incomplete or placeholder methods, which are typical during development.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Fortify SSC, with no malicious payloads, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network or file operations beyond normal API interactions.\n\n- Placeholder methods with NotImplementedError or assertions are common in SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert channels are evident.\n\n- The untested delete method with an assertion that always fails is a placeholder, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to incomplete features or placeholders)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence based on analysis)\n\n**The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or sabotage elements.**",
