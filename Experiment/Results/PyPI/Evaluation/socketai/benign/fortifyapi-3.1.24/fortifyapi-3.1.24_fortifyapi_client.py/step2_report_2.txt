  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for issues, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a Python client library for interacting with Fortify SSC API.\n- It contains classes for projects, versions, artifacts, issues, tokens, etc.\n- Many methods are wrappers around API endpoints, some with unimplemented placeholders (`NotImplementedError`) or stub functions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- The code performs standard network and file operations typical of an API client.\n- Some functions (e.g., delete in FileToken) contain assertions or are unimplemented, but these are likely placeholders or incomplete features, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Review:\n\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:** No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential security issues:** The code handles sensitive data (tokens, file uploads/download URLs) securely in context, with no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Incomplete functions:** Several methods raise `NotImplementedError` or contain assertions that always fail (e.g., `delete()` in `FileToken`), indicating incomplete features, not malicious intent.\n- **Use of tokens and API calls:** Standard for API clients; no suspicious URL domains or payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Upload artifact:** Streams large files via multipart encoding; typical behavior.\n- **Download URL:** Constructs URLs with tokens; standard for secure download links.\n- **Token creation/deletion:** The deletion method in `FileToken` is disabled with an assertion, possibly a placeholder.\n- **Methods with placeholders:** Many methods are stubs, which could be extended maliciously if modified, but as-is, they are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   | No malicious behavior; code is a standard API client. Slightly higher risk due to incomplete methods but overall low. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   | Same reasoning; no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   | Same; placeholders are benign, no malicious code. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   | No malicious activity; incomplete methods are not malicious. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   | Same; standard API client, no malware or obfuscation. |\n\n*The consistent low risk score (0.2) reflects the incomplete features but no malicious intent.*\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, due to incomplete methods and placeholders, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard API client library for Fortify SSC.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected.\n- The incomplete methods are likely placeholders or in-progress features, not malicious.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0.2**\n\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as an API client.
