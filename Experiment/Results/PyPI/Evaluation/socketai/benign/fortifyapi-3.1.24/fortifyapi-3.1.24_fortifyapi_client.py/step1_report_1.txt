  "purpose": "The code defines a client library for interacting with the Fortify SSC API, including classes for managing projects, versions, artifacts, issues, and related entities. Its purpose is to facilitate automated interactions with SSC for security and project management tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include API responses from various endpoints, user inputs (such as file paths and parameters), and environment data such as hostname. The code reads from local files (e.g., artifacts for upload) and external API calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests for data retrieval and modification, file uploads (artifacts), and token creation. There are also API endpoints that could be used to manipulate data, such as project, version, and issue management.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like API responses or local files into the code’s internal objects. These objects can then invoke API calls (sinks) to modify or retrieve data. Notably, the artifact upload function streams file data into API requests, and some functions generate download URLs with embedded tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears standard for a REST API client. The only minor concern is the untested delete method in FileToken and placeholders with NotImplementedError, which are not malicious but incomplete. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client library with classes modeling entities in the Fortify SSC system. It manages secure interactions with the API, including uploading artifacts, managing projects, versions, issues, and tokens. The methods perform standard HTTP operations and handle streaming large files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or covert channels. The use of tokens and API calls is consistent with legitimate API client functionality. The placeholders and unimplemented methods are not suspicious but suggest ongoing development. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client library for interacting with Fortify SSC, with no malicious or sabotage elements detected. Its structure and functionality align with expected API client behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
