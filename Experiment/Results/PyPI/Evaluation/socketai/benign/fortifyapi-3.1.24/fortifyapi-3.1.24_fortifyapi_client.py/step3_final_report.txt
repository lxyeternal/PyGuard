{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python client library for interacting with Fortify SSC API, providing resource management, file handling, and API request functionalities.",
  "sources": "API responses, local file operations (artifact uploads, rulepack uploads), environment data (hostname, time), URL tokens.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests; file uploads/download URLs; token generation; placeholder methods with unimplemented or assertion failures.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., files, parameters) into API calls; API responses into object instances; tokens used in URL generation for downloads; placeholder methods with unimplemented logic or assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError or containing assertions that always fail (e.g., delete in FileToken), indicating incomplete features or stubs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client for Fortify SSC, with well-structured classes and methods. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or covert channels are present. Placeholder methods and unimplemented functions are common during SDK development and do not suggest malicious intent. No signs of code obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's nature—an SDK with incomplete features but no active security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects incomplete features, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
