  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification**: The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no data flows, input/output, or embedded logic. The classes are straightforward, empty subclasses, which is a common pattern for defining custom error types.\n\n2. **Malicious behavior and obfuscation**: All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard and benign.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since there is no data handling, external interaction, or logic that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Confidence score**: All are 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**: The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly conclude that the code is harmless.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n- The scores seem reasonable and well-justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
