  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines exception classes without interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; classes are simple and standard, with no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward custom exception class definitions, each inheriting from Python's base Exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No external input, data handling, or output is implemented. The structure is standard and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be legitimate, purely defining exception types for use elsewhere.",
