  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n- No data input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code features are evident.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detectable.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Step 3: Check for logical errors or inconsistencies**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Critical evaluation of potential issues**\n\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic behavior, no vulnerabilities or malware are plausible.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as there is no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The overall code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; I concur with their assessments.",
