  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data collection; exception class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involved, as these are only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of custom exception class declarations with no additional logic; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. Each class is an empty subclass intended for specific error types. There are no suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and serves as a standard pattern for error handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only harmless exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
