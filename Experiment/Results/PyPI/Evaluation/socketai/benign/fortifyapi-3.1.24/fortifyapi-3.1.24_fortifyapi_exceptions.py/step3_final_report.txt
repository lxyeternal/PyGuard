  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no data input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None, as classes are simple definitions without data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or embedded logic. The classes are empty subclasses, a common pattern for defining error types. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no security issues or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports accurately assess the code's harmlessness, and no modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.",
