  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows, as the code only declares exception classes without any execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward class declarations without suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, likely for use in error handling within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious imports. The classes are simple and do not perform any actions beyond class inheritance. No input sources or data sinks are present, and there are no flow pathways. Overall, the code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is benign and serves as part of an application's error handling framework.",
