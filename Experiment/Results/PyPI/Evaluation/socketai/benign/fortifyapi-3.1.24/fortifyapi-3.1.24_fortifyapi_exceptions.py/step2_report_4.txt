  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no embedded code or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate, as there's no malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscation score of 0 is justified, as the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's intent and behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese align with the current assessments and are supported by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Final Remarks**:\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough in their analysis.",
