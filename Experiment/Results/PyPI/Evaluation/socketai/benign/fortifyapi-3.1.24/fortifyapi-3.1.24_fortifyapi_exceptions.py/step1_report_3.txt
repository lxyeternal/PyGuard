  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares classes without input handling or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. The exception classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no potential sinks or external interactions. The structure is simple, and the classes are standard custom exceptions with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional for custom exception handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
