  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The original code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or any dynamic code.\n   - The classes are simple, empty subclasses, typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues, errors, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward and benign.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is standard, with no anomalies, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes without any data flow, input, or output.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent.\n   - The code is a typical pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious, and transparent nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
