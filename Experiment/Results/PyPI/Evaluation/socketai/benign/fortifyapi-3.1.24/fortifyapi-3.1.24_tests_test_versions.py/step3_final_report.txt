{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for interacting with the Fortify SSC API, testing project version listing, querying, attribute retrieval, cloning, and artifact uploading.",
  "sources": "API responses from FortifySSCClient methods, local test resource file ('tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr') during upload, and print statements for debugging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; the code performs data retrieval and assertions without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses and local files through method calls and assertions; no malicious or suspicious source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The deletion of 'bugTrackerEnabled' fields appears as a workaround for a known bug, not malicious activity; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard API interactions and test assertions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The artifact upload is typical for testing purposes. The overall structure and behavior are benign, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the Fortify SSC API. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The artifact upload is standard in testing environments. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis.",
