{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the FortifySSCClient API, testing project versions, querying, issue summaries, attributes, and cloning functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration constants from 'constants', input data from API responses, and test artifact files from 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr'.",
  "sinks": "API calls to 'FortifySSCClient' methods, printing outputs, assertions, and file uploads via 'upload_artifact'.",
  "flows": "Constants provide credentials; API responses flow through assertions and pprint; 'upload_artifact' uploads a file to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code; straightforward API usage; no suspicious file paths or data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard unit testing for a security platform API, including listing projects, versions, and performing cloning operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The use of 'upload_artifact' is a typical test for artifact upload functionality. No anomalous code or security risks such as injection or data leaks are detected. All data flows appear legitimate within the context of API testing and do not involve untrusted input or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API unit test suite for a security platform with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. It functions as intended for testing API endpoints and upload procedures without security concerns.",
