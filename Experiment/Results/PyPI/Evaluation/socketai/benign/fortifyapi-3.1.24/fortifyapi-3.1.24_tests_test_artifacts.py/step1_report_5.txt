{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a unit test for uploading and managing artifacts in a Fortify SSC project.",
  "sources": "Constants for configuration, user input via test parameters, file path 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr' for artifact upload",
  " sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions such as uploading artifacts from an external file, project deletion, and API client interactions",
  "flows": "Input data from constants and file path flows into API client methods, which then perform upload and delete operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; the test performs standard API interactions; no obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test that creates a project, uploads an artifact, lists artifacts, and then deletes the project. It uses standard library and third-party API calls without unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The file path used for artifact upload is a local resource. The code does not perform any network communication beyond API calls. No suspicious or malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal unit test for interacting with the Fortify API to manage artifacts. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
