  "purpose": "This code appears to be a unit test for uploading and managing artifacts within a Fortify SSC project environment.",
  "sources": "Constants class for configuration, FortifySSCClient for API interactions, local file 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr' for artifact upload.",
  "sinks": "Methods that perform project creation/upsertion, artifact upload, listing, and deletion.",
  "flows": "Initialization of client and project -> uploading artifact -> listing artifacts -> deleting projects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. Usage of standard testing and API methods.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a client with parameters from a constants module, performs project upsert, uploads a specific file as an artifact, verifies artifact presence, and cleans up by deleting projects. The operations follow typical API usage patterns for managing project artifacts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code seems to be a controlled test case with no hidden or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for artifact management using the Fortify API. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate testing script without supply chain threats.",
