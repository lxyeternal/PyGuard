{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test script that interacts with the FortifySSC API to create or update a project, upload an artifact, verify the upload, and then clean up by deleting the project.",
  "sources": "Reads input from local file 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr' and API responses from FortifySSCClient methods.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include API responses and local file operations; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: local artifact file and API calls; Sink: artifact upload and project deletion via API methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It uses local files and API calls in a controlled environment. No network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
