  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward unit test for the FortifySSCClient API.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network activity are noted.\n- The artifact upload uses a local file ('tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr'), which is typical for testing.\n- The code performs project creation/upsert, artifact upload, listing, and cleanup.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or backdoors are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, indicating code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the controlled testing environment.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score, which is slightly above zero. Given the code's nature as a test script and the absence of any suspicious activity, this seems reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe unit test for API interactions.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (or 0.2 at most, but 0.1 seems more justified given the minimal risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.  \n- The code performs typical API testing functions.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.  \n- The slight security risk score reflects the fact that this is test code that interacts with an API and manages files, but in a controlled environment, so the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe existing scores are appropriate. I would keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the overall security risk at about 0.1, acknowledging the context of testing but confirming no real security concern.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.",
