{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a unit test for the FortifySSCClient API, testing project creation, artifact upload, and cleanup processes.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from 'constants'; input file path 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr' for artifact upload.",
  "sinks": "Uploading artifact file; listing and deleting projects.",
  "flows": "Constants and file path used for API interactions and artifact upload, followed by project deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no use of environment variables; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code; standard API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a client with URL and token from Constants, performs project creation/upsert, uploads an artifact from a local file, lists artifacts to verify upload, and then cleans up by deleting projects matching a query. All actions are typical for testing an API. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The artifact path is local, and no network exfiltration or backdoors are present. The usage is straightforward and aligns with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test script for interacting with the Fortify API. It performs typical operations without any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities. No security risks are identified.",
