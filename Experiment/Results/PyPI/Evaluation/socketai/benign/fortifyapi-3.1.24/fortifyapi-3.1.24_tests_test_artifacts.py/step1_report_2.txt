{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test for the FortifySSCClient API, specifically testing project creation, artifact upload, and cleanup operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'constants' module for configuration, and a file path 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr' for artifact upload.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'upload_artifact' method which uploads a file, and deletion methods that remove project instances.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration/constants to API methods; the artifact file path is read during upload; cleanup deletes projects based on queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. The code is straightforward test logic. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected. No network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing activities: creating a client, setting up a project, uploading an artifact, listing artifacts, and cleaning up. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as unauthorized data transmission, credential theft, or backdoors. The file path used for artifact upload appears benign and standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test script for interacting with a security API, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and legitimate.",
