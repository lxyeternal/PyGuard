{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for interacting with the FortifySSC API to manage projects and artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration constants, project names, and file paths. Calls methods on FortifySSCClient and project objects to upload and list artifacts.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external API (FortifySSCClient), file system access (upload of 'tests/resources/scan_20.1.fpr'), and project deletion functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (project name, artifact file path) flows into API calls and project management functions. No untrusted data is explicitly propagated to dangerous sinks like system commands or network without sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code. Usage of external modules seems standard for a testing context. The code primarily interacts with API clients and local files.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants, creates an API client, and performs project and artifact management through the API. It uploads a local file as an artifact, verifies artifact count, and then deletes projects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. The use of external APIs is legitimate and contained within testing functions. No hardcoded credentials are visible; tokens and URLs are sourced from a Constants object. The code does not include any suspicious network calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a unit test for API interactions with FortifySSC, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard testing code for artifact upload and project management.",
