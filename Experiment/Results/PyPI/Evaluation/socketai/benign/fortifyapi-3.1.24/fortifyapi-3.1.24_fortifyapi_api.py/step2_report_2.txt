  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard API client for Fortify SSC, handling authentication (tokens or username/password), request construction, retries, and pagination.\n- No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is identified.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, with high confidence (mostly 0.9 or above).\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical API client behavior without evident vulnerabilities.\n- The analysis consistently finds no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the descriptions; it provides token management, request handling, and session management.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident in the code snippets or the reasoning.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious behaviors.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n  - **Security risk:** Low, as expected for a well-structured API client.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports assume the code is used as intended; no evidence suggests misuse.\n- **Use of assertions:** One report notes assertions for authentication checks. While assertions can be bypassed if Python is run with optimizations, this is a minor concern and not malicious.\n- **Request handling:** The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with retries and session management, reducing the likelihood of malicious manipulation.\n\n### Risk and malware scores justification:\n\n- The malware scores are appropriately 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the standard nature of the code and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments:** No score adjustments are necessary; all scores align well with the analysis.\n- **Potential improvements:** Not relevant here, as no issues are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented API client for Fortify SSC, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Overall recommendation:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
