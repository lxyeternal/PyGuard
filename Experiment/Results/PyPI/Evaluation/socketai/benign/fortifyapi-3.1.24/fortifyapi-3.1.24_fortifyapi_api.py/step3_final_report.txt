{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python API client for Fortify SSC, handling authentication, token management, request construction, retries, and pagination to interact with the SSC REST API.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user credentials (__user, __pass), API responses (requests), and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include API responses (JSON data), token creation and revocation endpoints, and request parameters that could potentially be manipulated if misused.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from input (__user, __pass) to token creation; tokens are used in headers for requests; API responses are processed and yielded; request data flows from method calls to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no unusual code patterns. Minor note: use of assertions for security-critical checks which can be bypassed if Python runs with -O.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client utilizing requests with retries, session management, and token handling. It performs authentication via tokens or username/password, manages tokens securely, and constructs requests properly. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of assertions for security checks is a minor concern but not malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or data leaks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent across all reports. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented API client for Fortify SSC with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.15) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
