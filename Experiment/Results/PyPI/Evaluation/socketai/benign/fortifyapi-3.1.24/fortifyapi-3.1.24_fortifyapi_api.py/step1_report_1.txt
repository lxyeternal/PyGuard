{
  "purpose": "This code provides an API client to interact with Fortify SSC via REST, handling authentication, token management, and API requests.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user credentials (__user and __pass), tokens, and API responses from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include HTTP requests that could send or receive data, especially tokens or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Flow involves authentication data (user/pass or token) leading to token creation and revocation, with API request methods sending/receiving data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secret keys; token handling seems standard. The code uses standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscated code present. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard API client with secure handling of tokens, session management, and retries. Authentication is managed via tokens or username/password, with proper token creation and revocation. Data exchanges happen through well-defined HTTP methods. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. All data handling appears consistent with typical API client behavior. The use of retries and session management aligns with best practices, reducing risk of malicious manipulation. No external or hidden code is present. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client implementation for Fortify SSC with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles tokens and requests securely and transparently, with no suspicious or hidden functionalities.",
