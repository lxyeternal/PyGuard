  "purpose": "A Python class for interacting with Fortify SSC via REST API, managing authentication tokens, and performing HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters (auth, url, proxies), environment variables (none explicitly used), HTTP request inputs (endpoint, data, headers).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests (requests.post, requests.request), token creation and revocation, constructing and executing API calls.",
  "flows": "Auth data (username, password or token) is used to create or revoke tokens; tokens are stored and used in headers for subsequent requests; request data is sent via HTTP methods.",
  "anomalies": "None explicitly malicious; code manages tokens securely; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard API interaction patterns with token-based authentication, request retries, and pagination. The token creation and revocation use standard HTTP methods with authentication data. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious code injection, is evident. Usage of environment variables or environment-dependent data is minimal; proxies and verify options are configurable. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code maintains security practices by handling tokens carefully and using HTTPS. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for API communication with Fortify SSC without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client for Fortify SSC, with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It manages authentication tokens securely, performs API requests, and handles pagination properly. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
