{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python class for interacting with the Fortify SSC REST API, handling authentication, token management, and making various HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "User input for authentication details, parameters for API requests, and data returned from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external API endpoints, token creation and revocation, and data retrieval functions.",
  "flows": "Authentication data flows from constructor to token creation, token is used in request headers, request parameters flow into HTTP requests, and API responses are processed and yielded.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not appear to perform any unusual or suspicious activities such as hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Token management is standard, and all requests seem to be directed towards legitimate API endpoints. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or covert communications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client for Fortify SSC, managing tokens, making HTTP requests, and handling pagination. It uses standard libraries like 'requests' and 'urllib3' with proper retry mechanisms. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious request patterns. The logic is straightforward, primarily for authorized API interactions. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It implements standard request handling, token management, and pagination for interacting with a REST API. No malicious activities or security violations are evident based on the code review.",
