  "purpose": "Define a fixture class for capturing stdout and stderr streams during testing, controlled via environment variables or constructor arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'OS_STDOUT_CAPTURE' and 'OS_STDERR_CAPTURE' to determine whether to capture output streams.",
  "sinks": "Uses fixtures.MonkeyPatch to replace sys.stdout and sys.stderr with StringStream objects for capturing output.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables → determines capture flags → if enabled, replaces sys.stdout and sys.stderr with StringStream streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code uses standard testing fixtures and environment variables for configuration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a fixture class that captures output streams during tests, with configuration options via environment variables or parameters. It employs standard practices for patching sys.stdout and sys.stderr for testing purposes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities are evident. All dependencies are standard or benign, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for capturing output streams, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It follows common testing patterns and does not introduce any security risks.",
