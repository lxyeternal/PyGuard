{
  "purpose": "A testing fixture class designed to capture stdout and stderr streams during tests, controlled via environment variables or constructor parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'OS_STDOUT_CAPTURE' and 'OS_STDERR_CAPTURE'; constructor parameters 'do_stdout' and 'do_stderr'.",
  "sinks": "Replaced sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams with in-memory StringStream objects during tests.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or constructor parameters determine whether streams are patched; patched streams are used during test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard testing fixtures, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign test fixture for capturing output streams, relying on environment variables and known fixtures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. It employs standard practices for patching system streams during tests. No data leaks, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure and purpose are clear, and the use of environment variables is typical in testing contexts. The code is well-structured, with no logical flaws or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
