  "purpose": "Define a fixture class to set a test timeout duration based on environment variables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OS_TEST_TIMEOUT' and input parameters 'default_timeout' and 'scaling_factor'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only reads environment variables and sets internal values.",
  "flows": "Reads 'OS_TEST_TIMEOUT' environment variable -> calculates scaled timeout -> applies timeout fixture if > 0.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of unsafe functions or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing test timeouts based on environment variables and parameters. It reads 'OS_TEST_TIMEOUT' from environment variables, converts input parameters to integers, and scales the timeout accordingly. No network communication, file operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, primarily managing configuration for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing test timeouts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to set a configurable test timeout duration.",
