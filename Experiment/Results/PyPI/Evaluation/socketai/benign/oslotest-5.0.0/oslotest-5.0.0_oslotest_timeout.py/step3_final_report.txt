  "purpose": "Manage test execution timeout settings based on environment variables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'OS_TEST_TIMEOUT' environment variable.",
  "sinks": "Uses fixtures.Timeout to enforce test timeout; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> exception handling -> timeout application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for setting test timeouts, reading an environment variable, handling invalid inputs gracefully, and applying a timeout fixture. It performs only benign configuration tasks without network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. Exception handling ensures robustness. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard testing utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for managing test timeouts with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
