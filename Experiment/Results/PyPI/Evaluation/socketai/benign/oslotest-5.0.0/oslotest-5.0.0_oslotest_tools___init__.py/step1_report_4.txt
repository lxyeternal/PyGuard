{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose cannot be fully determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identified; no evident user input or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities are evident; no data leaks, network connections, or file writes are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no observable source-to-sink data flows; the code executes straightforward logic without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of standard Python constructs, functions, and control flows. No external or untrusted data sources are used, nor are there any operations that process external inputs insecurely. The absence of network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration points suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Given the lack of context and external interactions, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely a safe, non-malicious utility or processing script with no indications of malware, data leakage, or supply chain threats.",
