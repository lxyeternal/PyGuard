  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows significant suspicious patterns, including obfuscation and network activity, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.75. Other reports are consistent with benign or absent code, with scores appropriately low or zero. The assessments are justified and align with best practices in supply chain security analysis."
