  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, network activity, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data → code execution → network/file operations; obfuscation/hidden code → malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated strings, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation (strings, dynamic execution), network activity suggestive of data exfiltration, and potential malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (0.7) and malware score (0.6) are justified given these indicators. Absence of such patterns in other reports correlates with low scores. The confidence levels align with the evidence, and the overall security risk score (0.75) reflects the potential severity. No false positives are evident, and the analysis is consistent with the described signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows significant suspicious patterns, including obfuscation and network activity, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.75. Other reports are consistent with benign or absent code, with scores appropriately low or zero. The assessments are justified and align with best practices in supply chain security analysis.",
