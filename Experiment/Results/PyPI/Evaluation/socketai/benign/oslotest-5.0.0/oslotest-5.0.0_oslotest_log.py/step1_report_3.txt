  "purpose": "Configure logging levels and handlers based on environment variables for debugging and log capturing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'OS_DEBUG' and 'OS_LOG_CAPTURE' are read to determine logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration does not involve untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence logging level and whether logs are captured by a fake logger.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging setup fixture that configures log levels based on environment variables. It safely interprets string values and converts them into logging levels. The use of a FakeLogger for log capturing is a legitimate debugging aid. No evidence of malicious behavior or data leaks. No obfuscation or suspicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard and safe configuration of logging based on environment variables. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
