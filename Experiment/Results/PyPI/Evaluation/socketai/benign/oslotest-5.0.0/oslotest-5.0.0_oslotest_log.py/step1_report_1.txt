  "purpose": "Configure logging levels and capture behavior based on environment variables for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'OS_DEBUG' and 'OS_LOG_CAPTURE' for configuration; uses logging and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs logs to console or a fake logger, but no untrusted data flow leading to data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence logging configuration; no untrusted data flow to external sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; environment variable handling is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically configures logging levels based on environment variables, allowing for flexible logging setup. It includes validation for log levels and a feature to capture logs via a fake logger fixture. No malicious or suspicious behavior, code injection, or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Use of environment variables for configuration is common and safe here. No indicators of sabotage or malware, and the code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration setup with environment-based flexibility. No malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
