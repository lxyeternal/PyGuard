  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package setup code, no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package setup script using setuptools and PBR. It only imports setuptools and calls setup() with minimal configuration, specifying a dependency on 'pbr>=2.0.0'. There are no inputs, outputs, external connections, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
