{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle requests, possibly for data processing or API responses.",
  "sources": "Reading input from network sockets, request parameters, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential output to network responses, logs, or external systems, depending on request handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request sources through processing functions, possibly reaching output or logging functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. However, the code contains some complex logic that could hide malicious intent; need to review deeper for hidden backdoors or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server, defines request handlers, and processes incoming data. It uses standard libraries without obfuscation. No suspicious network connections, cryptic variables, or suspicious file operations are visible. Despite this, the structure allows potential data leakage if request data is mishandled, but no explicit malicious behavior identified. The code's complexity suggests a need for caution but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard server setup with request handling routines. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The security risk seems low, but the overall safety depends on external integrations and data handling practices.",
