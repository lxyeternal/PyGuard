  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, focusing on dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Use of 'eval', 'exec', environment variables, user inputs, network requests, file writes, and potential obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Execution functions ('eval', 'exec'), network communication, file system writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input or environment data flowing into 'eval'/'exec' or network/file sinks, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, complex or convoluted code structures, suspicious strings.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, which are strong indicators of malicious intent. The suspicion is higher when these features are combined. Absence of such features suggests benign behavior. The scores are assigned based on the presence and severity of these signals, with higher scores correlating to more suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Report 4 contains multiple suspicious indicators, justifying a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.7, and security risk of 0.75. Report 1 shows moderate suspicion with a malware score of 0.5, risk 0.5, and obfuscation 0.3. Other reports lack significant suspicious features, warranting low scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the code features described, with Report 4 being the most concerning and requiring further review.",
