{
  "purpose": "The code provides a fixture to unload or disable specified Python modules during runtime, primarily for testing or management purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.modules to identify loaded modules, and from fixture initialization parameters to determine which modules to disable.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules and sys.meta_path to prevent loading of specified modules, potentially affecting module import behavior.",
  "flows": "On setup, the code removes targeted modules from sys.modules and inserts a custom module finder that raises ImportError for those modules, blocking future imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard Python modules and typical testing fixtures. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixture to temporarily disable specific modules by removing them from sys.modules and inserting a custom import hook that raises ImportError for those modules. This approach is standard for testing or controlling module import behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond import management. The _NoModuleFinder class correctly raises ImportError for specified modules, preventing their import. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing module imports during testing or runtime. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is limited to controlling import behavior in a safe manner.",
