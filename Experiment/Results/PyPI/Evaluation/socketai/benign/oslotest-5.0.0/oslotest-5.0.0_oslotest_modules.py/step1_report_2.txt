  "purpose": "Provide support for unloading/disabling specified modules in Python during testing or runtime.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.modules to identify and remove specific modules; uses sys.meta_path to insert a custom module finder.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules modification and sys.meta_path insertion could potentially affect module import behavior, but no direct untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "sys.modules keys -> removal of certain modules -> insertion of _NoModuleFinder -> raising ImportError if the module is imported again.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code; standard use of sys and fixtures libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixture class for disabling modules by removing them from sys.modules and inserting a custom module finder that raises ImportError for the specified module. The _NoModuleFinder class enforces import restrictions by raising ImportError. The code appears to be a legitimate testing utility for controlling module import behavior. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for module management in testing scenarios. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its content and intent.",
