  "purpose": "A fixture to temporarily disable specified Python modules by removing them from sys.modules and inserting a custom import hook that raises ImportError for those modules.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.modules and module name parameters during setup.",
  "sinks": "Raises ImportError during module import attempts for targeted modules.",
  "flows": "Removes modules from sys.modules (source) and triggers ImportError when import is attempted (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward manipulation of import system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a testing fixture that removes specified modules from sys.modules and inserts a custom import hook (_NoModuleFinder) that raises ImportError for those modules and their submodules. It uses standard Python mechanisms for import management, with proper cleanup to restore original state. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is sound, and the purpose is limited to testing scenarios. No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility for disabling modules during tests. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1—are appropriate and justified given its controlled, testing-focused design.",
