{
  "purpose": "The code provides a fixture for unloading or disabling a specified Python module during testing by manipulating sys.modules and sys.meta_path.",
  "sources": "Reads the list of loaded modules in sys.modules, the module name passed during initialization, and the module import process via sys.meta_path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules to remove certain modules and inserts a custom module finder into sys.meta_path to block specific imports.",
  "flows": "The fixture removes specified modules from sys.modules, then the custom finder raises ImportError if an attempt is made to import the disabled module or its submodules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code implements a standard testing utility for module management. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixture class to unload a module by removing it from sys.modules and preventing future imports via a custom finder. The custom finder raises ImportError for the targeted module and its submodules. This pattern is consistent with testing utilities and does not indicate malicious behavior. No external data input, network activity, or harmful actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for disabling modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manipulates import mechanisms solely within the Python runtime environment for testing purposes.",
