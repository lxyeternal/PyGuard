{
  "purpose": "The code defines a fixture to temporarily disable or unload specified Python modules during testing by manipulating sys.modules and sys.meta_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from sys.modules (list of loaded modules) and uses class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies sys.modules and sys.meta_path, which influence Python's import system.",
  "flows": "During setUp, the code removes specified modules from sys.modules and inserts a custom import finder that raises ImportError for the target module, effectively disabling its import.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code implements a controlled module disabling mechanism, which is legitimate for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test fixture that temporarily disables a specified module by removing it from sys.modules and inserting a custom import finder that raises ImportError for any import of that module. This approach is used to simulate or prevent module import during testing, not for malicious purposes. There are no suspicious network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code operates solely within the Python import system, and all actions are transparent and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility designed to disable specific modules during test runs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs module manipulation in a straightforward manner intended for testing scenarios.",
