  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which flows to stdout; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI entrypoints.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI tool that outputs package info or version based on command-line input. It uses standard libraries and practices without any obfuscated or suspicious code. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no network or system modifications are attempted.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI entrypoint with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It solely outputs predefined package information and version, with no external data handling or suspicious activity.",
