  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logical Consistency:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It uses standard Python libraries (`sys`) with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` simply write static strings to stdout.\n   - The main function checks for `--version` argument and responds accordingly.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious code behaviors.\n   - No external dependencies or network calls.\n   - The code is simple, clear, and standard for CLI entrypoints.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs static output.\n   - They consistently identify no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0; no malware is present.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, as the code is not obfuscated.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which matches the analysis.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and harmless.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or malicious intent are present.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n   - The overall assessment is that this code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI script that outputs package info or version. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
