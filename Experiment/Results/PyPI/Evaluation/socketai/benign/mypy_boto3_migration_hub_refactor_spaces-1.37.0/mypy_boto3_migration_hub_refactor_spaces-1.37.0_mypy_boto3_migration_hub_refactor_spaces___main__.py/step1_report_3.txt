  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; sys.argv is read for command-line parameters",
  "flows": "User input via command-line argument (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs straightforward output operations with static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and uses command-line arguments to control flow. There are no external data sources, no user input validation beyond checking for a specific argument, and no untrusted data handling or network activity. The content is static, with no dynamic or obfuscated code. Overall, the code functions as a simple CLI utility without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended for displaying package information and version. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It does not interact with external systems beyond printing static info.",
