  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing informational output about boto3 stubs and versioning.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout.write for outputting info",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no untrusted data sources or network operations",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check flows to output functions, with no external data or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward command-line utility with static informational output",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that responds to '--version' by printing the version and otherwise prints package info. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout. No user input, network access, or dynamic data handling is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The functions are simple and well-structured, and the script's purpose is solely to display static information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
