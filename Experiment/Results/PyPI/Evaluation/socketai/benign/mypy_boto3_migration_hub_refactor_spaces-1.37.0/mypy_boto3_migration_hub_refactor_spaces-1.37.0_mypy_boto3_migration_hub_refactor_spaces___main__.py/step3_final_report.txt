  "purpose": "CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes static strings to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (e.g., '--version') triggers output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and lacks suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and outputs static info or version. It uses only standard library calls with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions are simple, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and it does not handle untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
