  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string.\n- There are no functions, input/output operations, external dependencies, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues and potential risks:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code snippet does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malicious activity:** None. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining a static variable.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None. No external data is processed or output.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malware activity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the assessment that this code is safe.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or issues?\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a simple, static version assignment with a comment. It does not process data, perform any logic, or include any suspicious constructs.\n- The presence of a copyright notice does not impact security.\n- The version string is hardcoded, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated overall security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the provided reports and the actual code content.",
