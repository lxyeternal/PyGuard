  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input handling; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static version string with a comment indicating the source of truth. It does not process input, access environment variables, or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no external dependencies or dynamic behaviors. The only potential concern is the comment about copyright and source of truth, which is benign and standard in version files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious declaration of a version number with no security risks.",
