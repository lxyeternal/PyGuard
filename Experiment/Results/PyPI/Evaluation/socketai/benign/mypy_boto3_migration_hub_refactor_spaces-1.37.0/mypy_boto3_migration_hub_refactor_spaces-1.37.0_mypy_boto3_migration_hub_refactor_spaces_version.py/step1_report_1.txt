  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for version information.",
  "sources": "The line setting __version__ retrieves the version string; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a string to __version__, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a copyright notice and a version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward version declaration with a copyright notice. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no data processing. It appears standard for Python packages to define a __version__ variable in a module. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a version string and includes a copyright notice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
