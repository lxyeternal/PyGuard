  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \n   The code is a minimal Python snippet that defines a `__version__` string variable, with a copyright notice.  \n   There are no functions, no input/output, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution.  \n   The purpose is purely to serve as a source of truth for the package version.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard practice for version declaration.  \n   No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data flow from untrusted sources is present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious indicators.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign version declaration.  \n   - There are no assumptions about hidden behaviors; the code is transparent.  \n   - No external dependencies or dynamic behaviors are involved that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Recommendations**  \n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.  \n   - Since the code is extremely simple, there is no need to adjust the scores.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n   The code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. It does not pose any security risk, does not contain malware, nor is it obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical version string assignment with no security concerns. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's simplicity.",
