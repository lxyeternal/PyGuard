  "purpose": "Define a static version string as the source of truth for the package version.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns a static string to a variable; no data flow from source to sink exists",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with a comment and a variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of a version string. There are no functions, dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or data processing. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code serves as a standard version declaration in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
