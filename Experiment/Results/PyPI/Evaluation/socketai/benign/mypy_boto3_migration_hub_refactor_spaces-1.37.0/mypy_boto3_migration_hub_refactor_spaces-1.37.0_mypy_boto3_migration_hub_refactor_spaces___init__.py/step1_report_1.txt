{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and documentation for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces SDK, including imports and class definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from internal files (.client, .paginator) and the embedded documentation comment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving user input or untrusted data; the code primarily defines imports, variables, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The documentation contains a copyright date beyond the current year but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a Python SDK. It imports classes from internal modules, defines a Client alias, and specifies exported symbols. The embedded documentation provides usage examples with no sensitive data. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The copyright year is outdated but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates access to the migration-hub-refactor-spaces client and paginators.",
