  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the descriptions to identify any discrepancies or security concerns.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from internal files, defines a client alias, and sets up exports. The embedded documentation provides usage examples. There are no dynamic data flows, user inputs, or network operations. The code is static and primarily serves as an SDK interface.\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious content:** None. The code is standard, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None. The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive information.\n\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor point is the copyright year being 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (October 2023). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not contain any malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the absence of any security issues, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Any adjustments needed?\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final justification:\n\n- The code is a standard SDK interface module with no dynamic or untrusted data handling, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0**     |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores provided are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
