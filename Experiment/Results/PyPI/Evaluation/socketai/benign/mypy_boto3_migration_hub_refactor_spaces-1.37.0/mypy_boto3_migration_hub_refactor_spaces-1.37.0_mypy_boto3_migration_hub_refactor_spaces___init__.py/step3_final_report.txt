{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python SDK interface module for the AWS migration-hub-refactor-spaces service, providing class imports, client aliasing, and documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and documentation strings; no untrusted input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process external input or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flow is static, involving only imports, aliasing, and documentation, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future relative to the current date, likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from internal modules, defines a client alias, and sets export variables. It contains a detailed docstring with usage instructions. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface setup. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor concern is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no changes are necessary.",
