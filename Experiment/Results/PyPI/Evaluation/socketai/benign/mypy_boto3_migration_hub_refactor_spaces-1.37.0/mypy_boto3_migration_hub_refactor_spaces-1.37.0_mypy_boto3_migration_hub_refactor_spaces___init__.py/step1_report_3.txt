{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and documentation for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service SDK, including imports and type aliases.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator) and static docstring content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines aliases without processing untrusted input or executing dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present. The documentation contains a URL, but it appears legitimate and unrelated to malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions, defines a Client alias, and sets __all__ for module exports. The docstring provides usage instructions and documentation links. No data input, output, or execution paths are visible that could be exploited or manipulated. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.",
