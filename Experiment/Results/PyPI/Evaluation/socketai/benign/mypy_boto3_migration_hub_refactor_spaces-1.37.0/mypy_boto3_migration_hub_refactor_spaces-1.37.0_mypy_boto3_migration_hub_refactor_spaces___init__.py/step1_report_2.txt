  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service, including importing relevant classes and setting up a client.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), static string for documentation, and the module's __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward, standard for SDK wrapper modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines an alias for a client class. It includes detailed documentation as a string comment. There are no inputs, data processing, or external data handling. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK interface setup with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It serves as a wrapper for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
