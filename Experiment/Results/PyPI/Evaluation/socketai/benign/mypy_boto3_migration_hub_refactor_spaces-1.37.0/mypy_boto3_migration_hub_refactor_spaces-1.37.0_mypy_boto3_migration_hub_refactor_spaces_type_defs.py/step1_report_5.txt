{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for migration-hub-refactor-spaces service type definitions, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, datetime, typing, and internal type definitions. Usage of sys.version_info to conditionally import typing modules. Definitions of TypedDict classes with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external input handling are present. No network, file, or system interaction code is included.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines data structures and type annotations; no data flow, input processing, or output mechanisms are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type definition module.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for a service SDK, using TypedDict for structured data. Conditional imports adapt to different Python versions, which is common for maintaining compatibility. The code contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network interactions. All classes are data schemas with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious module intended for type checking and documentation support.",
