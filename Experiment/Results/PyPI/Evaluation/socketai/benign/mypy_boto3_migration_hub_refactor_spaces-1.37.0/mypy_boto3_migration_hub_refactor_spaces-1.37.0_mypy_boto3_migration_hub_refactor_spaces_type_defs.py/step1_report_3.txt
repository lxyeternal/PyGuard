  "purpose": "Define type annotations for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service data structures to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from type annotations, imports, and docstrings. No untrusted input sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent over the network. No code executes dynamically or handles untrusted input in an insecure way.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code strictly defines data types and data structures without runtime data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type definitions with extensive conditional imports based on Python version. No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides detailed type definitions for a Python AWS SDK-like service, including TypedDicts, type aliases, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments. It does not contain executable code, user input handling, or network operations. The imports and definitions are standard and do not show signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detectable within these type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely a collection of type annotations and documentation for a Python SDK module. It lacks any malicious or security-compromising components. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type definition file with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
