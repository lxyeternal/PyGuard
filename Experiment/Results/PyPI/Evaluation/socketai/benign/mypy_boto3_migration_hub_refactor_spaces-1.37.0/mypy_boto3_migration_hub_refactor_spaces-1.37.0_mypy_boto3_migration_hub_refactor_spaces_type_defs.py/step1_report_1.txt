  "purpose": "Type definitions for migration-hub-refactor-spaces service in Python, primarily for type annotations and data structure modeling.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, import statements, and data structure definitions. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No code executes with untrusted data; the file is purely type definitions with no runtime data handling or IO operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or data processing logic; the code only defines data types and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import handling based on Python version for typing, but this is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and type aliases. There are no executable statements, no data processing, no network operations, or other potentially malicious activities. The presence of license, documentation, and type annotations aligns with standard SDK or API client library practices. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for an SDK-like Python package. It contains no executable or runtime code, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior. It appears to be a well-structured, version-compatible, purely declarative type definition module with no security threats.",
