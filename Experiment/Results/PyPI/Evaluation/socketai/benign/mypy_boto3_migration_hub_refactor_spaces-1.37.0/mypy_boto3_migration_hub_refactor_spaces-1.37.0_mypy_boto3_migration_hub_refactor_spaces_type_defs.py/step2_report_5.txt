  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is solely composed of type definitions using TypedDict, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n   - No executable code, data processing, network operations, or IO handling is present.\n   - The code contains documentation and licensing comments, typical for SDK or API schema modules.\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is purely type definitions with no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the assessments are consistent and accurate.\n   - No misinterpretations or overlooked issues are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with high confidence (1.0).\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, justified by the absence of executable code, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - This is correct; the code is purely declarative.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n   - No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious, purely type annotations.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK-like module.\n- It contains no executable logic, no external data handling, and no malicious or obfuscating elements.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, purely declarative, and poses no security threat.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
