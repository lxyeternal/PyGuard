  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for migration-hub-refactor-spaces service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks, and class definitions defining data schemas.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; code primarily defines data schemas without execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No execution flow; only data structure definitions. No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. Use of __future__ imports and version-based imports are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various request and response data structures, using TypedDict and conditional imports based on Python version. There are no function calls, external data reads, network operations, or code execution logic. The code appears to be a benign type definitions module for SDK or API usage, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type definitions for a Python SDK or client library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, simply defining data schemas and import logic. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
