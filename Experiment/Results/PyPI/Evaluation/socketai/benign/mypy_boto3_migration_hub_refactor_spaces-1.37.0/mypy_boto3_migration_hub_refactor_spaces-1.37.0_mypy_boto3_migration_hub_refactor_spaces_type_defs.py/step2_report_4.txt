  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, source, sink, flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Describes type definitions for an SDK-like module, with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious code; standard conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, defining data structures with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is safe, purely type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Similar to Report 1—type definitions for API schema validation.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime data handling or external interactions; standard import patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code remains static, defining data schemas without executing code or handling untrusted data. No malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns. The code is a standard, safe SDK type definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Same as above—type annotations for SDK data structures.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, data processing, or external IO.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Type annotations and data schemas, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Type annotations and data schemas, with version-dependent imports.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No execution logic or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured type definition module, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, purely declarative code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a large collection of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation comments.\n- **Behavior & Flow:** No executable code, no data processing, no network or IO operations.\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** None detected. The code follows standard practices for SDK type definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The code is purely declarative, with no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API client library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
