  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code is a collection of Python type definitions using `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n   - It includes documentation, licensing info, and extensive type annotations for request/response schemas of a hypothetical AWS SDK for \"migration-hub-refactor-spaces.\"\n   - There are no functions, runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - The code is purely declarative: defining data structures and type hints.\n   - No data is processed, no network or file IO, no untrusted input handling.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - Conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility, not malicious.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n   - No dynamic code execution, eval, or similar constructs.\n   - The code is well-structured, with clear licensing and documentation.\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, purely type definitions, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n   - They mention no suspicious patterns, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.\n   - Their confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n5. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware**: 0 — no malicious activity or payload detected.\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n   - **Risk**: 0 — no security risk identified; purely type annotations.\n\n6. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n   - The use of conditional imports and licensing comments are standard and benign.\n\n7. **Final Evaluation & Personal Estimate**:\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments.\n   - I would assign:\n     - **Malware score**: 0\n     - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n     - **Risk score**: 0\n   - The code is a legitimate, well-structured type definition module with no security threats.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a purely declarative set of type annotations for an SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or malicious activity. The reports are accurate and consistent. There are no security concerns here.",
