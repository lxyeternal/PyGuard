  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators:**\n   - The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments.\n   - No executable code, data processing, network calls, or external data handling are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The license and documentation are standard, and the import logic for Python version compatibility is common practice.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the code.\n   - The code appears to be well-structured, with consistent type annotations and clear data schemas.\n   - The use of conditional imports based on Python version is appropriate and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The risk scores are all very low or zero, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime or malicious activity.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's content.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Validity:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The code is a standard SDK type definition module, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely declarative, consisting of type annotations and data schemas.\n- No executable, network, or data handling logic is present.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Overall Security Rating:** **No threat detected.**",
