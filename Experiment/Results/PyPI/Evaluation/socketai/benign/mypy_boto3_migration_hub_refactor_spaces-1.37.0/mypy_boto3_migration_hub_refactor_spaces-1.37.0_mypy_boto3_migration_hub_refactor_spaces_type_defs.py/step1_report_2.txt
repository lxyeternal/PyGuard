{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service in boto3, used for API schema validation and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, sys, datetime, typing), local module literals, and the code's own class and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code defines data schemas without executing untrusted data or performing network or system actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely type declaration code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists of static type definitions with no dynamic execution, data processing, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations using TypedDict and Union for API request/response structures. It conditionally imports typing constructs based on Python version, which is standard. No function calls, data parsing, or external operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or suspicious patterns are visible. The presence of license and documentation comments indicates normal documentation practice. The code is consistent with standard type hinting for SDKs and does not include obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for a boto3 service, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be purely declarative, focusing on data structure schemas for API interactions.",
