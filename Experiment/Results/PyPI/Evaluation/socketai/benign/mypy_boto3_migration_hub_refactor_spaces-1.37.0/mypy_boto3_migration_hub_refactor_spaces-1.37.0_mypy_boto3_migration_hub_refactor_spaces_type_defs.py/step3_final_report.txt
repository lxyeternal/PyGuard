{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data schemas for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces SDK, defining request and response structures using TypedDict for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static class definitions, type aliases, and conditional imports based on Python version; no runtime data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or external data is handled; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "flows": "The code does not include runtime logic, data flow, or data processing; it only defines data structures used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is standard, well-structured, and includes no dynamic execution or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for request and response schemas, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no executable code, external data handling, or network interactions. The structure is clear, and the licensing and documentation are standard. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores in all reports (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purely declarative set of type annotations for an SDK, with no malicious or security concerns. It is well-structured, compatible across Python versions, and contains no runtime or external data handling logic.",
