  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service.",
  "sources": "The code reads package imports, sys version info, class definitions, method definitions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; methods are primarily interface definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to critical operations; methods are placeholders for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate for type safety, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client interface for AWS service interaction, including type annotations, class properties, and method signatures. It imports standard libraries and boto3 dependencies without executing or processing data. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage features are present. No external data sources or sink points are exploited within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type-annotated interface definition for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be auto-generated documentation and interface code for safe API interaction.",
