  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service, providing method signatures and documentation links for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Code imports, class method definitions, and property implementations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls and property accesses are standard SDK patterns; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or misleading variables. The only potentially suspicious element is the copyright date set to 2025, which is inconsistent with the 2023 knowledge cutoff, but this is likely just an outdated or hypothetical date, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for an AWS SDK client with detailed type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It includes standard SDK patterns such as method overloading for paginators and properties for exceptions. No logic execution, data processing, or external communications are implemented within the code itself. No signs of malicious activities, such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or credential misuse, are present. The presence of comprehensive type hints and comments suggests good maintenance, not malicious tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client stub for AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears purely as type annotation scaffolding for SDK use. No security risks or malware detected.",
