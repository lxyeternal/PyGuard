{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 MigrationHubRefactorSpaces service, providing structured interface and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method signatures; properties; constants; docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None directly involving untrusted data handling or external communication; standard boto3 client method definitions with documented parameters and responses.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow from input parameters to boto3 API calls; no evidence of data being manipulated insecurely or maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future but not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected; mostly standard type annotations and method declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a stub and interface declaration for a boto3 client with type annotations, exception classes, and method signatures. There are no operations executing untrusted input directly, no network operations or system modifications. The presence of detailed docstrings and type annotations suggests standard SDK wrapper code. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a legitimate, structured SDK interface implementation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured, standard interface for a boto3 client with no evidence of malware or security risks. It functions as a type-annotated stub for AWS SDK interactions, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
