  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service SDK.",
  "sources": "Code reads type definitions, sys.version_info for environment detection, and API documentation URLs. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code mainly defines interface signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date in the future (2025) and links to documentation, but no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It mostly consists of type annotations and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 client class and associated exception handling, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It defines method signatures for various AWS API operations, including paginators and exception types. No input handling, data processing, or network interactions are performed within this code snippet. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The presence of future copyright date appears to be a placeholder or a typo but is not malicious. The documentation URLs are publicly accessible and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK interface definition with type annotations for AWS service client. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. It is a benign, well-structured interface for interacting with AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
