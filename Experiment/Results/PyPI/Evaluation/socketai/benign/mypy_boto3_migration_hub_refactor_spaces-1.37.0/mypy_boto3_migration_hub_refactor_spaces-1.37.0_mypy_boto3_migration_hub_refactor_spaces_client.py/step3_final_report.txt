  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 MigrationHubRefactorSpaces SDK, providing a structured interface for AWS API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, class properties, method signatures with **kwargs unpacking, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or data leaks; input flows into API call signatures.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (via **kwargs) flow into AWS API calls; no data processing or external effects occur within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright date (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK stub with comprehensive type annotations, designed for type safety and API interaction. It contains no executable logic, data manipulation, or external communication. The conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only unusual element is the future copyright date, which is likely an oversight.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub for AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces. It shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
