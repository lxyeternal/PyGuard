{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service client, facilitating typed pagination in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods accepting **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "Paginator methods receive **kwargs for pagination parameters, which are passed to the underlying Paginator.paginate method, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for boto3 paginators with proper type annotations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with proper type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. It leverages boto3's Paginator class, customizing the paginate method with appropriate request parameter types. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual data handling. The presence of links to documentation and usage examples suggests it is a well-documented SDK extension, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign implementation of typed boto3 paginators for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
