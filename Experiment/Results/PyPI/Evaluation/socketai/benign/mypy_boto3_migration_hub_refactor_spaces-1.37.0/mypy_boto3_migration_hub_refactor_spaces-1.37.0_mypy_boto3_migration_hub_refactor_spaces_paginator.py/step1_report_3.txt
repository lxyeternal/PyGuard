  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service client, enabling paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Reading of package imports, class definitions, and method implementations for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input leading to vulnerabilities; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the 'paginate' methods accept kwargs with specified types but do not process untrusted data in a risky manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected. All code appears to be standard for boto3 stub implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for paginators in a boto3 client. It imports necessary modules, defines base classes with conditional typing based on Python version, and implements paginator subclasses with 'paginate' methods. No data processing, network communication, or credential handling occurs here. The code strictly focuses on typing and class structure, with no evidence of malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of boto3 paginator stubs with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is solely for type hinting and class structure, without handling untrusted data or performing any dangerous operations.",
