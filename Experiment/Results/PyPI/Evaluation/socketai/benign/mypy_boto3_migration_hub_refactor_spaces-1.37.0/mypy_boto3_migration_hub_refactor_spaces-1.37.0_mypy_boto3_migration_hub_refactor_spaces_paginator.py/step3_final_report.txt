  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's migration-hub-refactor-spaces service client, serving as SDK stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, type definitions, class inheritance, and method signatures accepting kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; methods return PageIterator objects without handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Methods accept **kwargs with specific type annotations and return PageIterator of response types.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard boilerplate code with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of paginator class definitions with type annotations for boto3 SDK, implementing 'paginate' methods that delegate to underlying Paginator classes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The structure is consistent with SDK stub generation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK stub code for boto3 paginators, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and overall security risk is negligible.",
