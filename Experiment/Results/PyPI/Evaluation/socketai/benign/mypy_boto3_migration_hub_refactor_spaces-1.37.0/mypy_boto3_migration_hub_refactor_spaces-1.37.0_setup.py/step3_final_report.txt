  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content, then executes setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script that imports necessary modules, reads a local file for description, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data sources, or network operations. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, with explicit dependencies and metadata. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
