  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script.\n- No dynamic, untrusted, or external inputs are processed.\n- No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior, static data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 2\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Analysis: Reads README.md, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Analysis: Static configuration, no dynamic input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- Purpose: Package metadata.\n- Analysis: Standard setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- Purpose: Publishing package.\n- Analysis: Standard, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate given the code. No changes are necessary.",
