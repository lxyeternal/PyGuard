{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package related to boto3 type annotations, used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written or used in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content and supplies static package configuration data; no external data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The script only performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that imports 'setuptools' and reads a local README.md file to set the long description. It defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs for documentation, source, and issue tracking. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved beyond static configuration. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
