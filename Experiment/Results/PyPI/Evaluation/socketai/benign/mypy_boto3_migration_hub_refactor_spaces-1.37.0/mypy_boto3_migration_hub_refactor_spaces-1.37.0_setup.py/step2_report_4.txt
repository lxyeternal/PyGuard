  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It notes no dynamic data, no external inputs, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes the code as a typical setup script with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly describes the code as a standard, static configuration script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Continues the pattern of standard setup code, no dynamic evaluation, no external input, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard, safe setup script, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious components.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign zero scores, which is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and based on the code's static, transparent structure.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed as 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no security concerns. All scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
