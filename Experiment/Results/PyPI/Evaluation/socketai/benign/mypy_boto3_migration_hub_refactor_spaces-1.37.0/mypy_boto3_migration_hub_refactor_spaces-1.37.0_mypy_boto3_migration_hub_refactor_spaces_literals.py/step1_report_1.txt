  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literal string constants used in the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables such as ApiGatewayEndpointTypeType, ApplicationStateType, etc.",
  "sinks": "None; the code consists solely of type alias definitions with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input processing; the code only sets up type annotations without execution logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is purely declarative type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types for use as type annotations. It also exports these types via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The content is standard for type stubs in SDKs or type hinting modules, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The purpose is purely to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of string literal types for type hinting, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It serves as a static type annotations module for AWS SDK service literals.",
