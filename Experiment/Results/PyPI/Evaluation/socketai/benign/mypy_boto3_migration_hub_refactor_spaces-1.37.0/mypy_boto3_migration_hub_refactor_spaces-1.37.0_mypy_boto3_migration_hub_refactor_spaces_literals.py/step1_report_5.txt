  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3 migration-hub-refactor-spaces service using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned to variables such as ApiGatewayEndpointTypeType, ApplicationStateType, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources; the code is purely defining types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type aliases for static type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal type aliases for use in type hinting. It includes documentation comments, but no runtime logic, external input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be for static type annotations in a larger SDK or codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of type alias definitions for static type checking purposes. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation module.",
