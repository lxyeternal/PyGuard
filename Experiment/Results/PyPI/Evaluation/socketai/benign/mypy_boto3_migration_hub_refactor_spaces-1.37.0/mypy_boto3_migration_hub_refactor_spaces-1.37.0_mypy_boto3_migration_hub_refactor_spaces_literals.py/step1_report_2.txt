{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces and related service enumerations using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "String literal definitions assigned to variables; conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input, no untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no code execution or malicious network activities.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static string literals to variables; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version. No obfuscated code, secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases for string literals used to annotate parameters or return types within a larger codebase. It includes conditional importing for compatibility with different Python versions. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code insertion are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, defining constants for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK-related string literals. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be an innocuous part of a larger SDK or typing stub module.",
