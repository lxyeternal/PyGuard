  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, logical flaws, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines string literal types for AWS SDK service literals. It is purely declarative, with no data processing or external interactions. No anomalies or malicious intent detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static type alias definitions, with no runtime logic or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic code or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and serves as a static typing aid.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines string literal types for AWS service and resource names, with no dynamic or unsafe operations.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the static nature and benign purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs a Python version check, imports 'Literal' accordingly, and defines static string literals for type annotations. No runtime logic or external data.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is a static type definitions module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, it defines string literal types with version-aware import, serving as static annotations.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static, declarative type alias definitions for string literals used in AWS SDK type annotations.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic code, no input/output, no network activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; the code is purely for type safety and documentation.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, static type alias module for AWS SDK literals. It is well-structured, version-compatible, and serves solely as documentation and type hinting aid. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe.",
