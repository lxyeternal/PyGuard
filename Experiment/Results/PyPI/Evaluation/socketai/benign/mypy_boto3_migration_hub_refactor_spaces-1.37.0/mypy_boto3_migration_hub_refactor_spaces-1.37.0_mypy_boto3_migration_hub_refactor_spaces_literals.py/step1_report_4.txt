  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the migration-hub-refactor-spaces service.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned to variables, imported 'sys' for version check.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code only declares constants and imports.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely static type alias definitions and a version check.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'sys' to perform a Python version check and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple string literal types assigned to variables, which are used for type annotations in other parts of the codebase. The '__all__' variable exports these definitions for module use. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a static type definitions module for documentation and type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static definitions module for type annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, has no external dependencies or dynamic execution, and serves a purely documentation and type hinting purpose.",
