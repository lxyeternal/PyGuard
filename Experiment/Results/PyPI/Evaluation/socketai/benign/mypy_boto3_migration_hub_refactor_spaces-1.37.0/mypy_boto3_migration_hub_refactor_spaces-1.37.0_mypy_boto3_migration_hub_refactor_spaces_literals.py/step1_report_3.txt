  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3 migration-hub-refactor-spaces service and related resource identifiers for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables, imported modules, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed; code only defines type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and static, serving as type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines multiple variables as string literal types for various AWS resource and service names. All variables are simple type aliases with no runtime logic, input processing, or side effects. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is detected. The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS SDK resource identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a static, non-executable definition module meant for type safety.",
