  "purpose": "Define static string literal types for AWS SDK service literals and related enumerations to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions assigned to variables representing AWS resource and service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input, output, or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal, with a version check for importing Literal. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code serves purely as type annotations for static analysis and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as a type safety aid for AWS SDK literals. No security risks, malicious activity, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
