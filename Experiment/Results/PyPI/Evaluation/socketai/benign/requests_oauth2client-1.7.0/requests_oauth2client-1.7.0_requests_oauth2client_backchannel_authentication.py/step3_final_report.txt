{
  "purpose": "Implementing classes for handling OAuth2 CIBA responses and polling jobs, managing token exchange and expiration logic.",
  "sources": "Input data includes auth_req_id, expiration parameters, and response parameters; external data is fetched via client.ciba().",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to client.ciba() for token exchange, which involves network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from response objects into polling jobs, which invoke client.ciba() to request tokens based on auth_req_id.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code follows standard OAuth2 patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of OAuth2 CIBA flow, with response handling, expiration checks based on system time, and token polling via client methods. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External calls are expected in OAuth2 flows, and the code does not perform any suspicious network activity beyond standard token exchange. The expiration logic is typical, and the overall structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard OAuth2 CIBA implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
