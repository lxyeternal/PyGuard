  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code implements CIBA response handling and polling, passing `auth_req_id` and response parameters into token requests via `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. External calls are standard OAuth2 client methods.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, indicating no security concern or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation with no evident vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on token polling and response expiration management.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses system time for expiration checks, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0 and 0.1 respectively, consistent with a benign implementation.\n- **Assessment:** Standard OAuth2 CIBA flow handling, no security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Handles response and polling, with expiration checks based on system time.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No anomalies or malicious patterns. Uses external `client.ciba()` for token exchange.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, aligned with benign code.\n- **Assessment:** Typical, secure implementation of OAuth2 CIBA.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous reports, managing response data and polling.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code or backdoors. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, consistent with a safe implementation.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard response and polling logic, invoking `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Security:** No anomalies or malicious indicators. Uses typical request handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Assessment:** Standard, secure OAuth2 flow implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm the code is a standard implementation of the OAuth2 CIBA flow, including response handling and polling.\n- **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Vulnerabilities & Risks:** The code relies on external, presumably secure, client methods (`client.ciba()`). The expiration logic and request handling follow standard practices.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-documented, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code is a typical OAuth2 CIBA implementation with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, legitimate, and free from malicious intent or supply chain risks based on the provided snippets and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's structure.",
