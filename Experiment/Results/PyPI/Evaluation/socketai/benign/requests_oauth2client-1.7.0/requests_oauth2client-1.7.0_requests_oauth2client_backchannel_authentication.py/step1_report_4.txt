{
  "purpose": "The code implements parts of the Client Initiated BackChannel Authentication (CIBA) flow, including response handling and polling jobs for OAuth2 clients.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include `auth_req_id` parameters, data from the OAuth2 client, and optional additional parameters from server responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests via `client.ciba()`, attribute access for response parameters, and data storage in object attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data (auth_req_id and response parameters) flows into response object creation and pooling job initialization; `token_request()` triggers network calls to obtain tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. Usage of external network calls is controlled via the OAuth2 client. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines data structures and a polling mechanism for the CIBA flow. It uses standard libraries, clear class structures, and proper handling of response parameters. The network call via `client.ciba()` is a legitimate OAuth2 token fetch. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code operates within the expected OAuth2 flow scope, and no malicious intent or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of a CIBA flow component for OAuth2. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It mainly handles response data and polling logic for authentication requests.",
