  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as implementing parts of the CIBA flow, including response handling and polling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that data flows into the token request via `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound, emphasizing standard OAuth2 practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is standard, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is solid; no issues found. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies input parameters and expiration checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that `client.ciba()` is called for token exchange.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is standard with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, no issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of input and expiration logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes token request via `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The analysis aligns with standard OAuth2 practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; scores match the assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes data flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes network requests via `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected. The code is standard OAuth2.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately cautious, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the main data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes token exchange via `client.ciba()`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or malicious patterns. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code obfuscation is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) reflects low but non-zero potential for security issues, mainly due to network requests and token handling, which are standard in OAuth2 flows.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Estimated Scores for the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard OAuth2 flow, no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears secure, benign, and aligned with standard OAuth2 CIBA implementations.",
