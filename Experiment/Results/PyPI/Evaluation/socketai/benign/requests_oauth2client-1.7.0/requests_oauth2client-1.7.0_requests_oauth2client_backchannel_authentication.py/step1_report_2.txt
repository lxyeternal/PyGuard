  "purpose": "Implementation of the Client Initiated BackChannel Authentication (CIBA) flow for OAuth2, enabling polling for user authentication status via an authorization server.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters like auth_req_id, expires_at, interval, and custom kwargs; reads the current datetime for expiration checks.",
  "sinks": "Uses client.ciba method to make token requests; accesses custom parameters via self.other; evaluates expiration based on system time.",
  "flows": "Input auth_req_id from external sources; expiration checks compare current system time to expires_at; token_request calls client.ciba with auth_req_id and additional params.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious API usage observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual data handling. No network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 CIBA flow with classes representing response and polling job. It relies on external client methods (client.ciba) for token exchange. The expiration logic uses system time, and the parameters are passed through well-defined interfaces. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation for OAuth2 authentication polling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of the OAuth2 CIBA flow with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles input/output and token polling securely using well-understood patterns.",
