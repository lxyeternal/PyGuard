  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Implements OAuth2/OIDC authorization request/response handling.\n- Supports PKCE, request signing, encryption, serialization.\n- Includes validation, error handling, and cryptographic operations via reputable libraries (`jwskate`, `binaPy`).\n- Uses secure random token generation (`secrets.token_urlsafe`) for state, nonce, code verifier.\n- Handles sensitive data with care, assuming external key management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No explicit issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Functionality:** All reported flows (validation, signing, serialization, error handling) are standard and correctly implemented.\n- **External libraries:** Usage appears appropriate and standard for security-sensitive operations.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None detected; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. External cryptographic libraries are reputable.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.\n- **Justification:** Code is clear, structured, and uses standard practices. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Most reports assign `securityRisk` around 0.1–0.2.\n- **Justification:** Standard OAuth2/OIDC handling with PKCE, signing, and validation. No evident security flaws or malicious activity. Slight caution due to reliance on external libraries and handling of cryptographic keys, but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Report Logic:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is implementing standard OAuth2/OIDC flows.\n- They emphasize the proper use of cryptography, validation, and serialization.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n- The risk scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Risk scores:** Given the thorough validation, reputable libraries, and no malicious activity, I agree with the assigned scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, and a low security risk (~0.1–0.2).\n- **Potential higher scores?** Only if external key management is insecure or if the serialization exposes secrets, but these are outside the code's control and not evidenced here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — low, due to standard practices and external library trust.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears secure, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent. The reports are consistent with this assessment, and I concur with their evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of specific components.",
