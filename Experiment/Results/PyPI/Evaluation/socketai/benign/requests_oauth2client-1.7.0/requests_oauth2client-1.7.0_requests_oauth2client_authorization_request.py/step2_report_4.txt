  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on potential security issues, logical consistency, and score justification.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured OAuth2/OIDC utility implementation.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- All reports assign very low malware scores (0) and low security risks (~0.1–0.2).\n- Confidence levels are high (above 0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n\n- The code correctly implements PKCE, request signing, serialization, validation, and error handling.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities like code injection, secret leaks, or malicious code snippets.\n- Proper cryptographic practices are followed via external libraries (`jwskate`, `binaPy`).\n- Serialization includes compression and base64 encoding, which are standard.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports are consistent; they do not identify any flaws or suspicious patterns.\n- They recognize proper validation, cryptography, and safe handling of parameters.\n- No logical errors or misrepresentations are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- Risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), justified by the secure handling of cryptography and validation.\n- No adjustments needed based on the reports.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- The code uses external cryptographic libraries, but these are reputable.\n- No suspicious data exfiltration, obfuscation, or privilege escalation.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- All claims are based on standard OAuth2/OIDC practices.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n\n- Scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No anomalies or inconsistencies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of OAuth2/OIDC utilities.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The serialization, cryptography, and validation are performed using reputable libraries and follow best practices.\n- The risk and malware scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity or backdoors detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear, well-structured, and readable.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — Slightly above zero due to cryptographic operations and external dependencies, but overall very low risk.\n\n**My recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, or possibly reduce the risk score to **0.1** for extra conservatism, given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented OAuth2/OIDC utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
