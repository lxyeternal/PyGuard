  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the code as implementing OAuth2/OIDC utilities, including PKCE, signing, serialization, and error handling. Inputs include parameters, response URLs, serialized data; sinks include cryptographic functions, URL generation, serialization.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies detected. Uses external cryptography libraries responsibly. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment correctly states that the code is a standard, security-conscious implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low). These are reasonable given the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard OAuth2/OIDC handling, JWT signing, and serialization.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets. Uses reputable libraries.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the code's standard, secure nature, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0. These seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focuses on request construction, signing, encryption, validation. Input data include parameters, keys, response URLs.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. Uses cryptographic libraries properly.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, considers the code secure and standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Slightly higher but still low; justified by the presence of cryptographic operations, which are standard but critical to handle securely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing request handling, signing, and validation.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses cryptography libraries responsibly.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes the code as handling OAuth flows with PKCE, signing, encryption, validation.\n\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. Uses secure token generation and cryptography libraries properly.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, considers the code secure.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to implement standard OAuth2/OIDC flows, with PKCE, JWT signing, encryption, and validation. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The reports' reasoning is consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is a standard, security-conscious implementation.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis. Obfuscation scores are 0, matching the absence of obfuscated code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** The risk scores are low (0.0 to 0.2), justified by the presence of cryptographic operations, which are inherently sensitive but handled responsibly.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1 — low, given the cryptographic operations are standard and well-managed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-implemented OAuth2/OIDC utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Overall Risk      | 0.1             |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's security posture as low risk with no malicious intent.",
