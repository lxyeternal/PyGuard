{
  "purpose": "The code implements OAuth2/OIDC authorization request and response handling, including PKCE, request signing, encryption, serialization, and validation, following standard security practices.",
  "sources": "URL parsing for responses, request parameter handling, cryptographic key usage, serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions (JWT signing/encryption), URL generation, serialization output, validation checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., response URL, serialized data) are processed through validation, cryptographic signing/encryption, and serialization to produce request URIs or validate responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of reputable libraries and secure random token generation for state, nonce, code_verifier.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth2/OIDC flows with PKCE, request signing, and validation. It employs secure random generation, external cryptography libraries, and proper validation steps. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident. Serialization includes compression and encoding, which are standard practices. External dependencies are reputable, and the code structure is clear and well-organized.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of OAuth2/OIDC utilities with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the thorough analysis. Overall, it is a secure and standard implementation.",
