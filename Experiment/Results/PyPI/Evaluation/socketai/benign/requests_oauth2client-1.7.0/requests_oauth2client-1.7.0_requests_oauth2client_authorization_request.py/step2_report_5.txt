  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and potential malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles OAuth2/OIDC flows, including PKCE, signing, serialization, and error handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or anomalies detected. Uses reputable libraries (`jwskate`, `BinaPy`). The report notes extensive use of external cryptography libraries, which is standard.\n- **Risk assessment:** Overall low risk, with a confidence of 0.9.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity suggests no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** The report’s conclusion aligns with the code's behavior; no issues found.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring appears reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on OAuth/OIDC utilities, including request signing and serialization.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious activity; standard cryptographic practices. The report emphasizes the proper handling of tokens and keys.\n- **Risk assessment:** Very low, confidence 0.95.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request construction, signing, encryption, and validation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard handling of cryptographic keys and tokens. The code manages sensitive data securely, assuming external key management.\n- **Risk assessment:** Slightly higher than previous, 0.2, but still low.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** The analysis correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on request creation, signing, and validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns; standard OAuth2/OIDC practices. Uses secure token generation (`secrets.token_urlsafe`), proper validation, and cryptography libraries.\n- **Risk assessment:** 0.2, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard OAuth/OIDC request/response handling with cryptography.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; cryptographic operations and validation are standard.\n- **Risk assessment:** 0.2, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score justification:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature—standard OAuth2/OIDC utilities with cryptography, no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting the inherent complexity and cryptography but no immediate threats.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** Given the thorough validation, cryptographic practices, and no suspicious patterns, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.1** overall, considering the complexity but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a standard, well-structured OAuth2/OIDC utility implementation, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a low security risk, with high confidence that no malicious activity is present.",
