{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for handling OAuth 2.0 / OIDC tokens, including ID Tokens and Bearer Tokens, for authentication and authorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include token strings (ID tokens, access tokens), environment variables (potentially via external utils), and HTTP request headers.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include storing tokens, validating tokens, decrypting tokens, and injecting authorization headers into HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Token strings are converted into JWT or JWE objects, validated against client configuration, and used to generate authorization headers or stored for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Use of cryptographic libraries appears standard. The code handles tokens securely with validation steps. The code performs JWT/JWE validation, including signature verification and claim validation, following standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard token management functions: representation, validation, and serialization/deserialization of OAuth2/OIDC tokens. It uses cryptographic libraries (jwskate) for JWT/JWE processing, validates token claims (issuer, audience, nonce, expiration), and supports signature verification with symmetric and asymmetric keys. The token validation logic aligns with standard practices, and no malicious or suspicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code, is evident. The use of compression and encoding libraries for serialization is also standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found; the code appears intended for legitimate token processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for OAuth 2.0 / OIDC token handling, validation, and serialization. It appears well-structured, uses cryptographic libraries correctly, and does not contain any malicious or sabotage code. The overall security risk is very low.",
