{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions for handling OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect tokens, including validation, serialization, and representation of access and ID tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading input from token strings (e.g., ID token, access token), environment variables (client secrets, keys), and external JWKS (key set).",
  "sinks": "Requests headers (Authorization), token validation routines, cryptographic verification steps, serialization/deserialization methods, and potentially network calls within jwskate library.",
  "flows": "Token strings are converted into token objects, validated via cryptographic checks, claims are verified against expected values, and tokens are serialized/deserialized for storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded secrets or credentials; cryptographic operations are performed securely; no obvious backdoors or unusual control flows; external dependencies used for JWT and cryptography are standard for security libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully implements token handling, including validation, cryptographic signature verification, claim checks, and serialization. No suspicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication outside standard validation, or backdoors are present. The cryptography is performed with established libraries (jwskate). The serialization uses compression and base64 encoding, which is typical for token storage. No malicious or sabotage patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of OAuth2/OIDC token management with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It utilizes established cryptographic libraries and performs thorough validation of tokens. No malicious signals or anomalous behavior are detected.",
