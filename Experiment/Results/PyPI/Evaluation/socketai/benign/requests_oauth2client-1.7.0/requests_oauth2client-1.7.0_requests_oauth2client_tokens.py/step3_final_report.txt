{
  "purpose": "The code manages OAuth2.0 / OIDC tokens, including creation, validation, cryptographic verification, and serialization/deserialization for secure token handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from token strings, claims within JWT/JWE objects, and external cryptographic keys for signature verification.",
  "sinks": "Performs cryptographic validation, claim checks, and serialization; no data leaks or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Token strings are parsed into JWT/JWE objects, claims are validated against expected values, cryptographic signatures are verified, and tokens are serialized/deserialized for storage or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Validation follows standards, and cryptography uses reputable libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth2/OIDC token handling, including signature verification, claim validation, and optional encryption/decryption. It employs reputable cryptographic libraries (jwskate), performs thorough validation of issuer, audience, nonce, expiration, and signature algorithms, and manages serialization securely with compression and base64 encoding. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The validation logic is comprehensive and aligns with protocol specifications. External network activity is limited to cryptographic operations, with no data exfiltration or suspicious calls. The code structure is clear, and exception handling is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of OAuth2/OIDC token management. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or sabotage elements. The overall security posture is high, with minimal supply chain risk.",
