{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect tokens, including validation, serialization, and token type management.",
  "sources": "Data is read from token strings, JWT claims, environment variables, and client configuration objects (e.g., client secrets, JWKS).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending tokens in Authorization headers, decoding and verifying JWTs, decrypting encrypted tokens, and serializing/deserializing tokens.",
  "flows": "Token strings are parsed into IdToken or JweCompact objects; validation functions check signature, issuer, audience, expiration, and claims; tokens are encoded/decoded for storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation; the code performs standard token validation and serialization. No signs of backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements standard OAuth2 and OIDC token handling features: token validation, signature verification, claim checks, serialization, and de-serialization. It uses cryptographic libraries (jwskate) securely for signature and encryption handling. Validation procedures follow protocol specifications, including signature algorithms, issuer, audience, nonce, and expiration checks. Serialization employs compression and encoding for storage, which is typical for session management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code's complexity and cryptographic operations appear legitimate and conformant with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of OAuth2/OIDC token management with no malicious intent detected. It securely handles token validation, encryption, and serialization. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
