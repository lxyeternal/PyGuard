{
  "purpose": "Main module for `requests_oauth2client`, aggregating and re-exporting classes and constants for OAuth2/OIDC functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`requests`, `jwskate`) and internal modules defining API clients, auth flows, exceptions, tokens, utilities, etc.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network communication, or untrusted data handling; solely consolidates and exposes components.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the `__all__` list; no runtime data processing or external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import/export pattern with no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing various modules and exposing them via `__all__`. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The module's purpose is purely structural, serving as an API surface aggregator for the package. All signals indicate benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package main module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting its harmless nature.",
