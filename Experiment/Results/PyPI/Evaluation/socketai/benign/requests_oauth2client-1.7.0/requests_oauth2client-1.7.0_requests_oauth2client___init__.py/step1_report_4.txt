{
  "purpose": "Main module for requests_oauth2client package, providing centralized import of classes, functions, and constants for OAuth2 client functionality.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (requests, jwskate), relative imports of various modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports modules and exposes classes/constants for external use.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is mainly a module aggregator with no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All imports are from internal modules or public libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an index module, importing various components and exposing them via __all__ for public API. No runtime logic, data processing, or network operations are present here. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as hidden code, network data exfiltration, or credential theft. The code's structure suggests standard packaging and module organization, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module aggregator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The overall security risk is negligible.",
