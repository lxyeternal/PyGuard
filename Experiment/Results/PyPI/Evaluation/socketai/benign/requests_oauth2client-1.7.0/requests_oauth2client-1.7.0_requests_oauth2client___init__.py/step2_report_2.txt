  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The module is a straightforward import/export hub for an OAuth2 client library, with no execution logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, due to slight uncertainty).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the module as an import aggregator with no data flows or suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the module is an import aggregator for OAuth2/OIDC components, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. The negligible security risk is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The module acts as a package index, importing and exposing components, with no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it describes the module as a package initializer with no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; a score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—purely import/export with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity—the risk scores of 0 or 0.1 are justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical package main module, serving as an API surface aggregator.\n- No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The imported modules are standard for OAuth2/OIDC client implementations.\n- The minimal risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for inherent package complexity but remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks present in this module)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the reports' assessments and supports the conclusion that this module is safe and standard for its purpose.",
