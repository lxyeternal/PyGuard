{
  "purpose": "This module serves as the main entry point for the `requests_oauth2client` library, importing various classes, functions, and constants for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect client operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules and classes, which are standard library or third-party dependencies such as `requests`, `jwskate`, and internal submodules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted input or data leakage within this file itself. It mainly performs imports and defines `__all__`, with no direct data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are present in this module. The code functions as an orchestrator or aggregator of components rather than executing runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of import statements and a defined `__all__`. There are no unusual code constructs, dynamic executions, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The module acts as a public interface consolidating multiple classes, functions, and constants for external use. It imports from various submodules and external dependencies, then re-exports selected symbols via `__all__`. The structure and content are typical for a package's main module. No obfuscated code, runtime data handling, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file, aggregating and exposing components for OAuth2/OIDC client functionality. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with common Python package practices.",
