{
  "purpose": "Main module for `requests_oauth2client`, providing imports and exports for various OAuth2 client functionalities and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (`requests`, `jwskate`) and internal submodules (`api_client`, `auth`, `authorization_request`, etc.). No user input or external data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leakage are present. The code only imports modules and defines an export list (`__all__`).",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink occurs in this code; it primarily sets up module exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code are apparent. The code is purely structural, organizing imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of import statements and a definition of `__all__`, which enumerates all public symbols for the module. It does not execute any logic, handle input, or process data that could be malicious. The external library `jwskate` is imported, but it is a known cryptographic library, not suspicious by itself. All imported submodules and classes seem related to OAuth2 client functionalities, authentication flows, and utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. There are no obfuscated sections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The module's purpose is to organize and expose functionality for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer, importing various components and defining exports without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and solely serves to organize package API surface.",
