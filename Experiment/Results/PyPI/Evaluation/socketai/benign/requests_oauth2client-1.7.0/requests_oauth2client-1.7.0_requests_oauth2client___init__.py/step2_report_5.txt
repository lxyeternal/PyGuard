  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that this module aggregates classes/functions/constants for OAuth2/OIDC, importing external (`requests`, `jwskate`) and internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs here.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious or suspicious code; straightforward import/export structure.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is safe, with high confidence (1). No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is a pure import/export hub with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the module's role as an entry point and aggregator.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or processing; primarily re-exports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies; all imports are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report reasonably states the code is legitimate, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still very high.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module as an aggregator for OAuth2/OIDC components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; the code is a typical package initializer.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes safety, with full confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security risks or malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly describes the module as a central import/export hub.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, correctly identifies the module's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** None. The code is purely structural, importing and exporting components.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior:** None detected across all reports and the code itself.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's nature, the overall risk is negligible; scores of 0 or very close to 0 are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis module functions as a safe, standard package initializer for an OAuth2 client library, with no signs of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured package entry point with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent with this assessment. I concur with the existing evaluations and recommend no changes to the scores.",
