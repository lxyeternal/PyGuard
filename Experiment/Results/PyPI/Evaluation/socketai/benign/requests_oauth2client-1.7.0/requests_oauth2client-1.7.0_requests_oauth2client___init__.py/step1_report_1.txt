{
  "purpose": "This module serves as the main interface for the `requests_oauth2client` package, aggregating various classes, functions, and constants for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect client implementations.",
  "sources": "The code imports external libraries (`requests`, `jwskate`) and internal modules/files such as `api_client`, `auth`, `authorization_request`, etc.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily exports classes, functions, and constants without performing any direct data processing, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows involving untrusted input leading to security-sensitive functions within this file; it mostly defines and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The imports and exports are standard for a library package. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports components of a larger OAuth2 client library. It includes only standard import statements, class, and function definitions, along with the `__all__` list. No execution logic, user input handling, or network operations occur in this module. The imported modules and classes appear to be well-structured and specific to OAuth2 and OIDC functionalities. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an organized import/export hub for the OAuth2 client library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python library main module.",
