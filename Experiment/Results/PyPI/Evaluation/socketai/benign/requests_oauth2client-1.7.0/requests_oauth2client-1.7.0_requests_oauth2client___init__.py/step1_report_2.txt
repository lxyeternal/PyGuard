{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a main import point for various components related to OAuth2 client functionality, including API clients, authentication methods, error handling, tokens, utilities, and discovery URLs.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules and submodules, which are not visible here. It also reads from environment variables indirectly through imported functions or classes, but no direct input reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "The module exports classes and functions that handle sensitive data such as tokens, credentials, and cryptographic keys. No direct sinks or data leaks are apparent in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths demonstrated in this module; it mainly imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. All imported modules appear standard for an OAuth2 client library. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code functions as a consolidator or entry point for a larger OAuth2 client package. It imports various modules and classes, and then defines a comprehensive __all__ list for exports. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations in this snippet. The imports and exports seem aligned with standard OAuth2 client operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The structure appears clean, and no anomalies like obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured main module for an OAuth2 client library. It primarily organizes and exposes functionalities without any suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Overall, it presents low security risk and no malware indicators.",
