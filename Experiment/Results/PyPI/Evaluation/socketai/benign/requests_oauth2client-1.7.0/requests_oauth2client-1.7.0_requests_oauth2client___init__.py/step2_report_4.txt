  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code is a main module for `requests_oauth2client`.\n- It imports external libraries (`requests`, `jwskate`) and internal modules.\n- It only defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or network activity occurs here.\n- The structure is typical for a package's main module, acting as an aggregator.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.\n- **Data flows:** No data flows involving untrusted input; the module only manages imports and exports.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the module is a standard API surface organizer.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **External dependencies:** `requests`, `jwskate` are well-known libraries.\n- **Internal modules:** All seem related to OAuth2/OIDC functionality.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.**\n- **No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation.**\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Notes:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, aligning with the code's nature.\n- The second report assigns a slightly higher risk (0.1), but given the absence of any issues, this is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores above 0.5:\n- **No reason exists** to assign a risk score > 0.5. The code is purely structural, with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- **Imported modules:** While `jwskate` is a cryptographic library, its presence alone isn't malicious.\n- **Exports:** Only public API exposure, no data handling.\n- **No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured main module for an OAuth2 client library. It functions as an import/export hub, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, clean, and typical for a package's main module.",
