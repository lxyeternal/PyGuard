{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for OAuth2 token polling jobs, used in backchannel flows like CIBA or Device Authorization.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and defines class attributes; no input reading from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls to time.sleep() and potential subclass implementations of token_request() that may involve network requests.",
  "flows": "Method __call__() calls sleep(), then token_request(); exception handling may trigger behaviors like slow_down() or authorization_pending().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of sleep() is standard in polling; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured base class for token polling with exception handling for OAuth2-specific flow control. It uses standard Python modules and well-known libraries (attrs). No hardcoded secrets, malicious network behavior, or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of time.sleep() for polling is typical. No signs of data leaks or malicious behavior are evident. The class is intended for subclassing to implement specific token request logic, which is expected to be provided externally. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of OAuth2 polling logic without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate base class for OAuth2 token polling with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for polling and exception handling in OAuth2 flows.",
