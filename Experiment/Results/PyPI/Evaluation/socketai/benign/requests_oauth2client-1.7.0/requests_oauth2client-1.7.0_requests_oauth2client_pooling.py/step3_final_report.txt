{
  "purpose": "Base class for OAuth2 token polling jobs, managing polling intervals and handling specific exceptions during token retrieval.",
  "sources": "The method token_request() implemented in subclasses; the sleep() method uses time.sleep() for delay.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; actual network requests and token handling are delegated to subclasses.",
  "flows": "The __call__() method calls sleep(), then token_request(), handling exceptions to adjust polling behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OAuth2 token polling framework component. It manages polling intervals, handles 'authorization_pending' and 'slow_down' exceptions, and delegates token retrieval to subclasses. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of time.sleep() is typical for polling mechanisms. The exception handling aligns with OAuth2 specifications. The code's benign nature is consistent with its role as a framework base class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured OAuth2 polling base class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It relies on subclasses for network interactions, which should be reviewed separately. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and obfuscation is absent.",
