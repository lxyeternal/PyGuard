{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for OAuth2 token pooling jobs used in authentication flows like CIBA or Device Authorization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external modules and classes such as OAuth2Client, BearerToken, and imported exceptions; it also reads attributes for class configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calling token_request(), which could be misused if overridden maliciously, and time.sleep() for delaying execution. However, there are no direct data leaks or unsafe outputs.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling the __call__() method, which waits (sleep), then attempts token_request(), handling exceptions to adjust behavior. No untrusted data is processed directly, and the flow is controlled internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured base class for OAuth2 token pooling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for OAuth2 token pooling with methods for handling authorization states and controlling request intervals. It imports standard modules, uses type annotations, and handles exceptions appropriately. No suspicious code or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. The methods and attributes are consistent with typical OAuth2 client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate base class for OAuth2 token polling flows. It lacks any signs of malicious intent or malware, functioning as part of a security-focused OAuth2 client library. No security risks are evident within this fragment.",
