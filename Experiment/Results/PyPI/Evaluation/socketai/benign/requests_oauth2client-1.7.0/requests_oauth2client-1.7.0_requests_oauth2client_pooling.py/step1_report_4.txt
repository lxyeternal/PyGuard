{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for OAuth2 token polling jobs, used for flows like CIBA or Device Authorization.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (time, typing, attrs) and class attributes; no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "Calls to time.sleep(), method calls, or exceptions handling; no sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - No external data or untrusted inputs are processed in a way that leads to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard class definition and exception handling for OAuth2 token polling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for OAuth2 token polling with appropriate exception handling and interval management. No hardcoded secrets, no network calls, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior observed. The sleep method uses time.sleep(), which is typical for polling delays. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an OAuth2 token polling mechanism. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It is part of an OAuth2 client library and does not perform any harmful actions.",
