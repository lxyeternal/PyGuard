{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for OAuth2 token pooling jobs used in backchannel flows like CIBA or Device Authorization.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read in this code; it relies on method calls and object attributes. The class methods may interact with external services via the `client` but no direct input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls made by `token_request()` (which is abstract here and to be implemented in subclasses), and the use of `time.sleep()`. The code itself does not perform network operations or data leaks but delegates such actions.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves calling `__call__()`, which waits (`sleep()`) and then attempts `token_request()`. On exceptions (`SlowDown`, `AuthorizationPending`), it adjusts the interval accordingly. The actual request execution happens in subclasses' `token_request()`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. Usage of `time.sleep()` is standard for polling mechanisms. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical OAuth2 polling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for token endpoint polling in OAuth2 flows, with appropriate exception handling for typical OAuth2 retry scenarios. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is primarily a framework component, expecting subclasses to implement actual network requests. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. It relies on external subclasses for network interaction, which could be checked separately for malicious behavior, but as-is, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a polling framework for OAuth2 token retrieval, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and follows common patterns, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments.",
