{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for token endpoint pooling jobs used in OAuth2 flows like CIBA or Device Authorization.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (time), type annotations, attrs library, and local modules (exceptions, client, tokens). No direct user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or sensitive data leaks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observable. The code primarily manages internal state and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The class structure is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-structured base class for OAuth2 token pooling with clear methods for handling retry logic and interval management. It relies on external subclasses to perform actual token requests. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The logic involves standard sleep calls and exception handling, typical for polling mechanisms. No external data is read directly, nor are any data leaks or malicious network activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured base class for OAuth2 token polling. It does not contain any malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It focuses on internal state management and exception handling without engaging in harmful activities.",
