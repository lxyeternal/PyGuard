  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring of malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of OAuth 2.0 client authentication methods, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as expected for standard code)\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis. The code relies on external cryptographic libraries, handles credentials securely, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** The report's scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard OAuth client implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low, considering the context)\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms proper handling of credentials, JWT signing, and request modifications. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight increase in risk score reflects cautiousness but remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard OAuth 2.0 client auth implementation with proper cryptographic practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code's cryptographic operations, request modifications, and credential handling are standard and secure. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate OAuth client implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms proper JWT creation, signing, and request handling. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements OAuth 2.0 client authentication methods securely, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning aligns with the scores. The code's cryptographic operations and credential handling are standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature as a standard OAuth client implementation.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, consistent with clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect low but cautious assessment, which is reasonable given the cryptographic operations and external key handling.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — appropriate given the context; no significant security issues.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the detailed analysis.",
