  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Clearly describes standard OAuth 2.0 client authentication methods, with typical data flows—credentials into headers or request bodies, JWTs signed with external libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. JWT signing correctly uses external keys and algorithms. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, standard OAuth flows, with potential points where untrusted data could influence request modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. JWT signing with external keys is standard. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is acceptable. Malware is 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2—still low.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous reports, standard OAuth 2.0 implementations, with JWT assertions signed with external keys.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses well-known libraries. No suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard OAuth 2.0 client auth flows, with proper JWT signing and credential handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The JWT creation uses supplied keys properly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Implements standard OAuth 2.0 methods, with data flowing into headers and request bodies. Uses cryptographic signing with external keys.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code relies on external inputs and libraries, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity, backdoors, or covert channels detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero but low (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical security considerations for cryptographic operations and external key handling, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned across all reports are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code appears secure, well-implemented, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard for cryptographic implementations with external keys)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are appropriate, and the code is trustworthy based on the provided analysis.",
