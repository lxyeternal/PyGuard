  "purpose": "Implementation of OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication Methods, including secret-based, assertion-based (JWT), and public client schemes, for secure client-server communication.",
  "sources": "Request headers (Authorization), request body parameters (client_id, client_secret, client_assertion), JWT claims during signing.",
  "sinks": "Request headers (Authorization), request body (client_id, client_secret, client_assertion), JWT signing process.",
  "flows": "Input credentials or keys → request modification (headers or body) → JWT creation/signing → request sent to server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Cryptographic operations follow best practices. No malicious code or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard OAuth 2.0 client authentication methods with proper cryptographic handling via external libraries. It securely manages credentials, signs JWT assertions correctly, and modifies requests according to OAuth specifications. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage are present. The cryptographic operations and request modifications are consistent with best practices, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented OAuth 2.0 client authentication module. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
