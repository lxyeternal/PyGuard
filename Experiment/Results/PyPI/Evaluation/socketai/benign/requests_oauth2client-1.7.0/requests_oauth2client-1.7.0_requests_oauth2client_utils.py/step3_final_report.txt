  "purpose": "Utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, including checks for scheme, credentials, port, fragment, and path, as well as a decorator for handling expiration parameters.",
  "sources": "URI input strings, expiration parameters (`expires_in`, `expires_at`)",
  "sinks": "Exception raising (`InvalidUri`) on validation failures, conversion of expiration parameters into `datetime` objects",
  "flows": "Input URI parsed with `furl`, validation checks performed, exceptions raised if checks fail; expiration parameters converted and passed to decorated functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code; straightforward validation logic; no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URI validation, enforcing security policies such as HTTPS scheme, absence of credentials, no custom ports, no fragments, and presence of a path. The `InvalidUri` exception provides detailed feedback. The expiration decorator allows flexible handling of expiration parameters, converting `expires_in` to an absolute `expires_at`. Usage of the `furl` library is typical for URI parsing. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for URI validation and expiration handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
