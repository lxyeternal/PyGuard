{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URI validation, error handling, and a decorator for managing expiration parameters in method calls.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'uri' parameter in validation functions and the 'expires_in' and 'expires_at' parameters in the decorator.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'furl' for URI parsing and validation, and the decorator passing data to other functions; no explicit unsafe sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The URI validation functions parse and validate input URIs; the decorator converts 'expires_in' into 'expires_at' and passes it to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns. The 'furl' library is a third-party dependency, but usage appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URI validation, raising exceptions for invalid inputs based on specified criteria. It also includes a decorator for handling expiration parameters, converting 'expires_in' into a datetime 'expires_at'. No dangerous or suspicious code constructs are present. The validation logic correctly checks for HTTPS, credentials, port, fragment, and path conditions. The decorator provides flexible expiration handling without executing untrusted code or external commands. No obfuscated patterns or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for URI validation and parameter handling. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. Usage of 'furl' is appropriate and does not introduce security concerns. Overall, this code is safe and standard in its implementation.",
