  "purpose": "Utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling used in various parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party 'furl' package, and functions that process URI validation parameters and decorators.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection or misuse could occur if untrusted input is passed directly into URI validation functions, but no direct sinks like network calls or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings (URIs, expiration parameters) are validated or transformed; no data flows into untrusted sources to dangerous sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs standard validation and decorator wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URI validation with configurable checks, raising errors on invalid URIs, and includes a decorator for handling expiration parameters. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code structures are present. Usage of 'furl' is for URI parsing, and no network or file operations are involved. The functions enforce URI security constraints and manage expiration logic without any hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides safe utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It appears to be standard, secure utility code with no security risks or malware indications.",
