{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for URI validation and handling expiry parameters in method calls, mainly used for endpoint validation and date-time management.",
  "sources": "Input is read from URI strings in functions `validate_endpoint_uri` and `validate_issuer_uri`, and from function parameters `expires_in` and `expires_at` in the decorator.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input (URI strings, expiry values) are used in URI validation functions. The decorator modifies expiry date parameters, but does not execute or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "URI strings are validated through `validate_endpoint_uri` and `validate_issuer_uri`. Expiry parameters are transformed into datetime objects within the decorator before being passed to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code strictly performs validation and date-time calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides URI validation functions that enforce HTTPS, absence of credentials, ports, fragments, and presence of paths. The validation logic is straightforward, leveraging the `furl` library. The decorator `accepts_expires_in` enhances method flexibility by allowing expiry times to be specified as seconds, converting them into `datetime` objects. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. All logic pertains to input validation and parameter handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions focused on URI validation and expiry handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with clear purpose and no suspicious operations.",
