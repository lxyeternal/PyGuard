  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; no external data flows or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code performs standard validation with `furl`. The `InvalidUri` exception communicates specific issues.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is benign with a high confidence (0.9). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The validation logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identified; no unsafe sinks or external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns. Usage of `furl` is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk, high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0 matches the benign assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions for URI validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Valid; no external network or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; straightforward validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; functions for URI validation and expiration handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; no external or dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The decorator simply converts expiration parameters.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, maximum confidence (1.0). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions for URI validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; no dangerous data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 matches the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs URI validation and expiration handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by the nature of validation functions.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** All reports are consistent and accurate, with no unreasonable score assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 (standard validation functions, low risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a set of standard utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
