  "purpose": "Utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, used in multiple modules for validating endpoint URIs and handling expiration parameters.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the `uri` parameter in `validate_endpoint_uri`, `validate_issuer_uri`, and the `expires_in` and `expires_at` parameters in the `accepts_expires_in` decorator.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the `InvalidUri` exception raised during URI validation. The `accepts_expires_in` decorator converts `expires_in` into a `datetime` object for use in other functions, but this is a benign transformation. No dangerous data handling or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data (`uri`, `expires_in`, `expires_at`) flows into validation functions or decorators, which may raise exceptions or modify the data for further processing. No external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code performs standard validation and decorator wrapping. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation of URIs to ensure they meet security and structure requirements, preventing potentially malicious or malformed URLs. The `InvalidUri` class helps communicate specific validation failures. The `validate_endpoint_uri` and `validate_issuer_uri` functions check for scheme, credentials, port, fragment, and path compliance. The `accepts_expires_in` decorator provides flexible handling of expiration parameters, converting seconds or strings into datetime objects, with no external or harmful side effects. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code behaviors present. The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It enforces URI security policies and provides flexible expiration parameter handling. Overall, the code is safe, with a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
