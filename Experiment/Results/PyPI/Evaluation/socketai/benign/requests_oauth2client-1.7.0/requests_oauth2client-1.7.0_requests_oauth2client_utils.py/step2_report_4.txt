  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling. Uses `furl` for parsing, raises `InvalidUri` on validation failures, and provides a decorator for expiration parameters.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code; validation logic is standard. The `InvalidUri` exception provides detailed error messages.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and low risk is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling. Uses `furl` for parsing, raises exceptions on invalid input, and provides a decorator for flexible expiration handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behavior. Usage of third-party library `furl` is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. These are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion of benign utility code is consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Provides URI validation and expiration handling functions. Uses `furl`, raises exceptions, and decorates functions to accept expiration parameters.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. No network or external activity. Validation logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions with URI validation and expiration handling. Uses `furl`, performs validation, and enhances functions with expiration parameter flexibility.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behaviors. No external network calls or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.0 or 0.0-0.1. The report states 0, which is acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling. Uses `furl`, performs validation, and provides a decorator.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still reasonable given the context.\n- **Assessment:** The overall conclusion of safety is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify or suggest any malicious activity. The code is purely utility functions performing validation and parameter handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are present.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. There are no indicators of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** The scores are very low (0 to 0.2), consistent with utility functions that perform validation without side effects.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is standard, safe, and performs common validation tasks.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimates:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard validation utility)\n\n**In conclusion, the code is benign, well-structured, and safe.**",
