{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, mainly used in network endpoint configurations and timing logic.",
  "sources": "URI strings passed to validate_endpoint_uri() and validate_issuer_uri(); function parameters such as expires_in and expires_at.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raise InvalidUri exceptions; invoke decorated functions with possibly manipulated expiration times.",
  "flows": "Input URI or expiration parameters are validated or transformed, with exceptions raised for invalid URIs; expiration parameters are converted to datetime objects and passed to target functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL manipulations, or hidden code; the code appears straightforward and consistent with utility functions. The only notable aspect is the exception raising upon invalid input, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URI validation using the 'furl' library, checking for scheme, port, credentials, fragment, and path based on parameters. It raises 'InvalidUri' exceptions for invalid inputs. The 'accepts_expires_in' decorator modifies functions to accept either 'expires_in' (seconds) or 'expires_at' (datetime), converting 'expires_in' to a datetime. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. All functionalities align with typical utility purposes, and no suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of utility functions for URI validation and expiration handling, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity. It adheres to expected patterns and uses common libraries without any obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
