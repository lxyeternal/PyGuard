  "purpose": "A wrapper around requests.Session for REST API calls, providing URL management, request customization, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for URL paths, request data, headers, cookies, environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via requests.Session.request, URL joining, parameter serialization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction, request setup, and network transmission; URL validation prevents absolute URL injection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; URL validation explicitly blocks URLs with '://', reducing injection risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client wrapper with proper URL validation, parameter handling, and error management. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The URL validation explicitly prevents injection of absolute URLs, and data serialization handles boolean values safely. No signs of malicious activity or malicious network behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified based on the thorough validation and standard design. It is safe for production use.",
