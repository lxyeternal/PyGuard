  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling errors from OAuth2 and related endpoints in the requests_oauth2client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests and requests_oauth2client; exception class definitions; property accessors; initialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls, setting of attributes, property accessors, and custom exception messages.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger exception raises via super().__init__ or attribute assignments; exception attributes store error details; no untrusted data is directly executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network calls; structure is typical for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for OAuth2 error handling. It uses standard Python features, including inheritance, property decorators, and exception raising. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code strictly models error types and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All data handling appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply models error conditions and does not perform any harmful actions.",
