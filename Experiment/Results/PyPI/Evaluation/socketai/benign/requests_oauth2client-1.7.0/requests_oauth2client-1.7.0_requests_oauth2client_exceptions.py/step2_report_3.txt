  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code consists solely of exception class definitions for OAuth2 error handling.\n   - No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n   - The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or any form of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Security Risks:**\n   - The code mainly stores error details and provides structured exception handling.\n   - The only potential concern is the handling of untrusted data in exception messages (like `description`, `error`, `error_description`, etc.), but these are used solely for informative purposes and do not influence control flow or execute code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or insecure practices are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports give a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports give 0, which is justified.\n   - **Risk Score:** The highest given is 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to the nature of error handling (which inherently involves untrusted data). This seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the detailed analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n   - Since the code is purely structural exception classes, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made that are unsupported by the code.\n   - The code is standard for an OAuth2 client library and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given error handling involves untrusted data but no actual vulnerability)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk score reflects the minimal concern, primarily due to handling untrusted data in error messages, which is standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
