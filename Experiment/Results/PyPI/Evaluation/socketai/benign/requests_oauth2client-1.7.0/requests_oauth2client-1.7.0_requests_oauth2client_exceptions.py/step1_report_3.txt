{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for error handling in the requests_oauth2client library, including OAuth2, endpoint, authorization, and related errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing.TYPE_CHECKING, requests, and internal modules; class initializations and property methods.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__ methods, property accessors, and error class instantiations that handle error information.",
  "flows": "Error information from responses (requests.Response or string) flows into exception objects and their attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Code is primarily class definitions for structured error handling. No network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes for handling OAuth2 errors, with careful separation of error types and descriptive messages. It relies on external request objects for context. No evidence of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The design appears standard for an OAuth2 client library, focusing on error reporting and handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of error classes for OAuth2 workflows, with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It provides structured error handling without executing or injecting any malicious actions.",
