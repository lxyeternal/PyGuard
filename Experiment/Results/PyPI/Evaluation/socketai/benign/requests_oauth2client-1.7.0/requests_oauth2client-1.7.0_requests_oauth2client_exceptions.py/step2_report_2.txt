  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling OAuth2 and OpenID Connect errors.\n   - It imports `requests` and type hints, with exception constructors storing response data and error details.\n   - The classes are primarily data containers with minimal logic—mainly storing and exposing error information.\n   - No network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs within these classes.\n   - The code appears to serve as structured error handling for an OAuth2 client library.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The exception classes do not perform any network activity, file I/O, or other potentially malicious actions.\n   - The data stored in exceptions is used solely for error reporting and debugging.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.\n   - They emphasize that no external data is executed, no network calls are made, and no secrets or backdoors are embedded.\n   - The purpose across reports is clear: error modeling for OAuth2 flows, with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1) in the first report, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to error handling, which is acceptable.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern might be if untrusted data (like error messages) could be exploited, but since these are just stored and displayed, and not executed, the risk remains low.\n   - The code does not perform any validation or sanitization of error strings, but this is typical for exception classes and not inherently dangerous.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary; the reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I concur with the assessments: the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the low inherent risk of error classes, mainly for debugging and error reporting)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
