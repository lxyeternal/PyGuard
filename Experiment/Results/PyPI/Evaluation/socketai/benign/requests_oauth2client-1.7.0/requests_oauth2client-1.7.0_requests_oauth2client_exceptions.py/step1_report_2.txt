{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes used for error handling in an OAuth2 client library, primarily for handling responses from OAuth2 endpoints and related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes and constructors. No external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing. The class constructors store parameters but do not perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is class definitions with initializers, not data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. No backdoors, hidden network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for error handling within an OAuth2 client context. It primarily initializes attributes with parameters received, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or insecure practices. No indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are present. The structure is straightforward, with clear purpose to manage errors related to OAuth2 protocol endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of exception class definitions for OAuth2 error handling. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious patterns. It is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain threat.",
