  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various OAuth2 and OpenID Connect errors in a secure and structured manner.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'requests' and 'requests_oauth2client' components; exception class initializations and properties.",
  "sinks": "Exception constructors and property methods that process response objects and error details.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation occurs with response/error data, which are stored and may be accessed by properties or subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Use of exception inheritance and custom attributes is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines exception classes for OAuth2 error handling, utilizing standard Python features and typing annotations. No external network interactions or data leaks are present. The code appears to strictly serve as error representation, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. It relies on typical exception handling patterns, with clear input validation and data storage. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of structured exception classes intended for error handling in OAuth2/OIDC flows. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is standard and appears safe for use.",
