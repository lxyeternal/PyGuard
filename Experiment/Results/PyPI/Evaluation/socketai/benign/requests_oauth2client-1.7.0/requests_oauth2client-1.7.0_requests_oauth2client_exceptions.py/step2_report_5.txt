  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the details provided, the code's nature, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a collection of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code is static, primarily class definitions with initializers and attributes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to provide structured error handling, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issue Presence\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines exception classes without any suspicious or malicious content.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The code appears correct and well-structured.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n#### Malware Score\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, code injection, network calls, or payloads are present. The code is purely for error representation.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Justification:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are evident.\n\n#### Risk Score\n- All reports assign a very low security risk (~0.1 or 0).\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard error class hierarchy with no apparent security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions, with no malicious behavior or security flaws.\n- **Scores higher than 0.5:** None are justified given the code's nature.\n- **Inconsistencies:** The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- The code does handle error information from external sources (responses, error strings). While untrusted data flows into exception messages, this is standard for error handling and does not pose security risks.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to error handling, but very low risk overall)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
