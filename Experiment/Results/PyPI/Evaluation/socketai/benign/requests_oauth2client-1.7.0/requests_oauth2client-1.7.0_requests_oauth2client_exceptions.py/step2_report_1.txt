  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are present, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a set of exception classes for OAuth2 error handling, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. They emphasize that the code is standard, well-structured, and safe, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code content:** The code is purely class definitions for structured error handling. No network calls, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Behavior:** The classes are initialized with response/error data, stored as attributes, and used for error reporting. No suspicious logic or side effects.\n- **Security concerns:** None identified; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-Issue Review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Defines exception classes for OAuth2 errors.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is very low, which is appropriate given the purely structural nature. No change needed.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Defines error classes, no external input processing.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The risk is minimal.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Defines exception classes, no external data processing.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Defines error classes, no dynamic or network code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Exception class definitions, no harmful operations.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the code's purpose as error definitions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **No code execution or data exfiltration:** The code only defines exception classes.\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** The code is transparent.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or backdoors:** None present.\n- **Scores are appropriate:** Given the nature of the code, the scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, as it is purely structural error handling code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe for supply chain use, and the scores reflect its benign nature.",
