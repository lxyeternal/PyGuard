{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various OAuth2 and related protocol errors within the `requests_oauth2client` library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, class attributes, and imported modules. Specifically, it reads from `response`, `client`, `error`, `description`, `uri`, and `request` objects/parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be in exception messages (e.g., `description`, `error`, `error_description`, `error_uri`, `response`), but these are used solely for informative purposes in exceptions and not for executing code or influencing control flow.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (such as error codes and descriptions from OAuth2 endpoints) flow into exception objects and messages, but these do not directly influence program control or behavior beyond exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Exception classes only encapsulate error information. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for various exception types related to OAuth2 protocol errors. It includes the use of type annotations, property accessors, and custom exception messaging. There are no operations that execute untrusted data as code, send data over the network, or manipulate files in suspicious ways. The import statements are limited to typing and standard modules, and the classes serve as structured error representations. Overall, the structure is consistent with standard error handling practices, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in an OAuth2 client library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It appears to be well-structured, transparent, and safe.",
