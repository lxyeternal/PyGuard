{
  "purpose": "Defines a comprehensive hierarchy of exception classes for handling OAuth2 and OpenID Connect errors, facilitating structured error reporting within an OAuth2 client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from response objects, error strings, and request parameters during exception initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond storing error details for reporting.",
  "flows": "Error details flow from external responses into exception attributes, used solely for debugging and error handling; no malicious flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for structured error handling, with no network calls, data leaks, or code execution. It uses standard Python exception patterns, with type annotations and attribute storage. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely error representation, and it does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of OAuth2 error classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
