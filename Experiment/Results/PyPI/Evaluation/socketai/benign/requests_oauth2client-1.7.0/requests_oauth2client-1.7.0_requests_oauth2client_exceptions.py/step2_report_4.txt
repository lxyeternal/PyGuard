  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for structured exception handling related to OAuth2/OpenID Connect errors.\n- No network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to serve as a well-structured error handling framework within an OAuth2 client library.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk Scores:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of malicious content.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent in their analysis, emphasizing that the code is purely for error representation.\n- No claims are made that go beyond the code's actual functionality.\n- The scoring seems appropriate: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- The code relies on response objects and error details, which are standard in error handling. These are used solely for informative purposes.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The detailed class hierarchy and type annotations suggest a robust design, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a standard, secure, and well-structured set of exception classes.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly related to error handling, not security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
