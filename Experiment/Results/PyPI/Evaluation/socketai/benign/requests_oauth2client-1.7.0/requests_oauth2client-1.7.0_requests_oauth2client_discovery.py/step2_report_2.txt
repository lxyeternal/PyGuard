  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Generate well-known URLs for OpenID Connect and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.\n- Implementation: Uses the 'furl' library to manipulate URL paths, appending standard segments.\n- Behavior: Pure URL construction, no network calls, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Security: The functions are straightforward, conform to standards, and do not introduce apparent security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The URL construction is standard and safe.\n- No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or backdoors.\n- No dynamic code execution or external network activity.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is that the functions do not validate the input URLs (`origin`, `issuer`). If invalid URLs are passed, the resulting URLs might be malformed. However, this is typical for such utility functions and not inherently insecure.\n- No input sanitization or validation is performed, but given the context, this is acceptable since the functions are for URL generation, assuming the caller provides valid URLs.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1 or 0). The functions are safe, and the overall risk is minimal.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports assign very high confidence (mostly 1 or 0.95), which is justified given the straightforward, standard URL construction.\n- The overall security assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n- The only improvement could be adding URL validation, but this is not critical here.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | **0**             | No malicious behavior or payloads detected.                                                    |\n| **Obfuscated** | **0**             | Clear, straightforward URL construction; no obfuscation present.                              |\n| **Risk**       | **0**             | The functions are safe; minimal security risk, mainly due to lack of input validation, which is acceptable in context. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a well-implemented, standards-compliant utility for URL generation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The high confidence scores in the reports are justified. No changes are necessary to the reported scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I would assign the following scores based on my analysis:\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the observed behavior of the code.",
