  "purpose": "Generate URLs for well-known metadata documents for OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 discovery based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "Function arguments: origin, name, issuer; imported modules: furl",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating URL strings; use of furl library to manipulate URLs",
  "flows": "Input issuer/origin -> URL construction via furl -> URL string returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code; URL construction appears standard and safe",
  "analysis": "The code constructs well-known URLs using the furl library, with parameters controlling URL path segments. It handles URL paths correctly, appending well-known metadata endpoints based on standard specifications. No user input is executed as code; URLs are built purely through string and path manipulations. The code does not fetch or process sensitive data, nor does it contain dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL construction utility for well-known metadata documents. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it pose security risks. The implementation appears safe and straightforward.",
