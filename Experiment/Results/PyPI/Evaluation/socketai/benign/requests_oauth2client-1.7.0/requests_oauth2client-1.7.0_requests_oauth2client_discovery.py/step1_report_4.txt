  "purpose": "Generate well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'origin', 'name', 'issuer'. The 'origin' is parsed from URL strings. No direct user input or external data fetching is present.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs URL strings; no sinks such as network requests or data leaks are present within this code segment.",
  "flows": "The functions take issuer URLs or components, process them to generate URLs for discovery documents, and return URL strings. No data flows to sinks that could cause malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. It uses URL manipulation libraries and standard URL structures. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents based on provided issuer URLs. It employs a URL manipulation library (furl) to safely generate URLs at specified paths, with options to choose root or directory-based paths. The functions do not perform any network operations, data storage, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The code follows standard URL construction practices and does not appear to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL builder for well-known discovery documents in authentication protocols. It does not contain malicious code or behavior. The implementation appears safe and straightforward.",
