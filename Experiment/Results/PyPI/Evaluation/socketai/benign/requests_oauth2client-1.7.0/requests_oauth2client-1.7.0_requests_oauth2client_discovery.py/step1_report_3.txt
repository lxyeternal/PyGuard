  "purpose": "Provides functions to generate well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads input URLs (`origin`, `issuer`, `name`), uses the `furl` library for URL manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Returns constructed URL strings; does not perform network requests or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are processed to produce well-known URL strings; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The URL construction appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to generate well-known URL paths for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents. It uses a well-established URL manipulation library (`furl`) to append paths based on provided parameters. No untrusted data is executed or injected, and no network calls are made. The functions do not handle sensitive data or credentials. Overall, the code appears to be a safe URL construction utility, aligned with relevant standards. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL builder for well-known discovery documents, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely constructs URLs based on input parameters without performing any unsafe operations.",
