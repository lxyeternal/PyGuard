  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for constructing well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a security risk score of 0 is justified. No modifications are necessary."
