  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code constructs well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.\n- They highlight that the code uses the 'furl' library for URL manipulation, which is standard and safe.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The functions do not perform network requests, handle sensitive data, or execute untrusted code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.95), indicating strong agreement on safety.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to correctly implement URL construction as per relevant RFCs.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network calls, no data leaks, no code injection.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Input validation:** Not explicitly performed, but this is typical for URL builders; the risk is minimal given the context.\n- **Use of external libraries:** 'furl' is a standard, well-maintained library.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (around 0.1 or 0), as the code is a utility for URL construction without vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- **Potential concern:** The functions accept raw strings for URLs without validation. While not inherently dangerous, in some contexts, maliciously crafted URLs could cause issues downstream. However, within this scope, it's standard practice, and no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Scores higher than 0.5:** None of the reports assign high scores; all are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard URL construction utility)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, standard, and compliant with specifications.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since no validation is performed, but the risk is negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standards-compliant URL generator for well-known discovery documents. No malicious or suspicious activity is present, and the risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
