  "purpose": "Generate well-known URLs for OpenID Connect and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'origin' and 'issuer' strings representing URLs; use of 'furl' library for URL manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL strings; no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are combined and manipulated via 'furl' to produce standard discovery document URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward URL construction with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs for well-known documents following RFC standards, using 'furl' for safe URL manipulation. It does not perform network requests, handle sensitive data, or execute untrusted code. Input parameters are not validated but are used as-is, which is typical for such utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are simple, standard, and conform to specifications. The security risk is minimal, given the nature of URL construction functions. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is correctly zero; the security risk score could be considered zero, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for constructing well-known URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a security risk score of 0 is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
