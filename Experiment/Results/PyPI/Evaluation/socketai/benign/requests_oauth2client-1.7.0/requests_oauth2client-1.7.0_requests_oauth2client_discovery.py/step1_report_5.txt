{
  "purpose": "This code generates URLs for well-known metadata documents for OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 discovery endpoints based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from the parameters `origin` and `issuer`, which are URLs or URL identifiers provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The functions return URL strings; no untrusted data is used directly in security-sensitive operations like code execution or network requests.",
  "flows": "Input `origin` or `issuer` is processed by `furl` to construct URLs, which are then returned. No further data flow to external systems occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs URL construction with no validation of the input URLs; however, this is expected behavior for URL generation functions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on external URL inputs and constructs well-known URLs based on standard specifications. It uses the 'furl' library for URL manipulation, which is a standard approach. There are no embedded or dynamically executed code segments, no hardcoded credentials, and no network communications or data leaks. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with specification standards, indicating no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides utility functions to generate URLs for well-known OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 discovery documents. It operates securely, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the provided scope.",
