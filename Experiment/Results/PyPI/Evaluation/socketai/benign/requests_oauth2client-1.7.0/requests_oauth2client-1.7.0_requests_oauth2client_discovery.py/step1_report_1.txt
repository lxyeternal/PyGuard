  "purpose": "Generate well-known URLs for OpenID Connect and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'origin', 'name', 'issuer'. Data read from these strings to construct URLs.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output constructed URLs as strings; no direct untrusted data usage or external network calls.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> URL construction with furl library -> URL string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of external libraries (furl) appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to construct well-known URLs based on provided issuer or origin strings. It uses the 'furl' library to manipulate URL paths safely and follows relevant RFC standards. No user input is executed or transmitted, and the functions only build and return URL strings. The usage of 'furl' is standard, and no malicious behavior or data leakage mechanisms are present. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely constructs URLs for OIDC and OAuth2 discovery documents based on input issuer URLs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears safe and well-structured.",
