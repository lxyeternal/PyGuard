  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code constructs URLs for well-known OpenID Connect and OAuth2 discovery documents based on issuer URLs.\n- It uses the 'furl' library for URL manipulation, which is standard and safe.\n- There are no network requests, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- Input parameters are strings representing URLs; no validation or sanitization is performed, but this is typical for URL construction utilities.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct in its URL construction logic.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risks:** All reports agree on the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities or dangerous patterns.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.1 or 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Confidence levels:** Very high (1 or 0.95), consistent with the thorough review.\n- **Anomalies or suspicious elements:** None identified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment of scoring:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 vs 0), but given the code's purpose, a risk score of 0 is justified. The one report with 0.1 may be overly cautious, but it's acceptable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- No reason to assign a higher malware or risk score, as the code is purely URL construction with no malicious intent.\n- The code does not handle sensitive data, nor does it perform dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** I agree with the majority's assessments: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a safe, standard URL utility for well-known document endpoints. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
