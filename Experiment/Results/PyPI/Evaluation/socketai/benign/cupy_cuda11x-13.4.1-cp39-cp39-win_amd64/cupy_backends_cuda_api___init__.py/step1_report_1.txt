  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules or data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of commands based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are not apparent. Usage of standard libraries appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical utility functions, possibly importing standard modules without suspicious patterns. No malicious network activity, credential theft, or system manipulation observed. No obfuscated code or unusual logic. The structure suggests standard data handling, with no clear malicious intent or malicious behaviors identified. Lack of context prevents definitive conclusions, but there are no apparent security issues or malware signals.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign code with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
