  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module with some functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, imported modules, environment variables, and possibly user inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data transmission points, though none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to processing logic, then potentially to sinks such as output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscated or malicious constructs. No unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed thoroughly. It consists of standard imports, straightforward functions, and typical control structures. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, malicious network calls, or backdoors are present. The absence of external network communications or system modifications suggests low risk. The code’s purpose appears benign, and there are no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscated constructs, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard Python script with no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
