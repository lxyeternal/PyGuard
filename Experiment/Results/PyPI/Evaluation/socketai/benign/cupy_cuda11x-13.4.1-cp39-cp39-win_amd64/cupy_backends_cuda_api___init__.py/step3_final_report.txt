  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, parameters, standard library functions, and external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points such as eval/exec, and data leaks through hardcoded secrets or URLs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscated variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs or credentials, suspicious control flows, or empty/placeholder scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that most snippets are benign, with standard data handling and no suspicious patterns. Report 4 describes obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious data flows, justifying high malware (0.65), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.7) scores. Other reports show no signs of malicious activity, with scores around 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk (~0.2). The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The overall assessment suggests a low malware and obfuscation risk, with a notable exception in Report 4, which warrants caution. The confidence levels are high where code is straightforward and lower where code content is absent or unclear.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with one report (Report 4) indicating significant obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, justified by the described suspicious features. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no further adjustments are necessary unless actual code reveals additional malicious indicators.",
