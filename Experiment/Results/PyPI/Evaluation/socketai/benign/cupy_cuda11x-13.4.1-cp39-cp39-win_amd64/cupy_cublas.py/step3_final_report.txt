{
  "purpose": "GPU-accelerated linear algebra routines using cuBLAS and CuPy, performing matrix operations, factorizations, and vector computations.",
  "sources": "Arrays read from numpy or cupy objects, data pointers into GPU memory during computations.",
  "sinks": "Results stored back into cupy or numpy arrays; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from host arrays into GPU buffers, processed by cuBLAS functions, then results are written back to arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GPU linear algebra interface, managing data pointers and GPU resources properly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. Warnings about large matrices are benign. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The functions perform expected mathematical operations with proper input validation and resource handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GPU-accelerated linear algebra library interface with no malicious or sabotage features. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
