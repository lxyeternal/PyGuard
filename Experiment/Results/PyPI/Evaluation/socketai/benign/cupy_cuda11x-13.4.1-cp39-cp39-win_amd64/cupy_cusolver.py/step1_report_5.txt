{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning regarding the use of the 'cupy.cusolver' module and encourages the use of 'cupyx.cusolver' instead.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all functions from 'cupyx.cusolver'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to security issues",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; only an import and warning",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('from cupyx.cusolver import *') can be considered poor practice, but is not inherently malicious. The deprecation warning is standard for library updates.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the entire 'cupyx.cusolver' module, which is a common pattern in Python but can lead to namespace pollution. It then issues a DeprecationWarning indicating that 'cupy.cusolver' is deprecated and suggesting to use 'cupyx.cusolver' instead. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data leakage, malicious code execution, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and relates solely to module import and user notification.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign import and issues a standard deprecation warning. No malicious intent or security risk is evident.",
