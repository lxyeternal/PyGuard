{
  "purpose": "Import the 'cusolver' module from 'cupyx' and issue a deprecation warning about its usage.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from cupyx.cusolver import *' triggers the warning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and warns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') is stylistically poor but not malicious; no obfuscation or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and issues a deprecation warning. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are involved. The wildcard import could cause namespace pollution but does not pose security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are present. The deprecation warning is routine and indicates maintenance, not security issues. The minimal code activity and lack of external data or control flow suggest a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with only a stylistic concern regarding the wildcard import. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warning is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
