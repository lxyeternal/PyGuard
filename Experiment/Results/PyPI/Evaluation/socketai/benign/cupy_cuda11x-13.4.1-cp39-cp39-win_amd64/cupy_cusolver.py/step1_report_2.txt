{
  "purpose": "The code issues a warning regarding the deprecation of an old module and imports functions from an external library for GPU-accelerated computations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'cupyx.cusolver' and the warnings.warn() call",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output manipulation",
  "flows": "Import from 'cupyx.cusolver' (source) -> warnings.warn() (notification), no data flow leading to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning suggests code maintenance but not malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The script imports GPU solver functions from a well-known library (cupyx) with a deprecated warning and then notifies the user. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code execution. The code is minimal, with no user input, data processing, or network activity. The use of a deprecation warning indicates awareness of library updates but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import and issues a deprecation warning for a library component. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be routine maintenance or update notification code.",
