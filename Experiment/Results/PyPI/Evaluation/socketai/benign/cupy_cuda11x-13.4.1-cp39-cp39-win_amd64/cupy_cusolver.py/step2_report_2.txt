  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any security concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import of the 'cupyx.cusolver' module, with deprecation warnings.\n- The code uses 'import *' or 'from ... import *', which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but not malicious.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, network activity, or data leaks are involved.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice for informing users about outdated modules.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import and warn.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the minimal code activity. No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import and warn.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.1, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher malware score (0.1) is probably unwarranted, as there's no malicious activity. The code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score should be 0, matching the other reports. The security risk remains low.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions and warn.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just a wildcard import, which is stylistic. No issues.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import deprecated module and warn.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just maintenance warning.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions and warn.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, benign.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware scores:** All should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher than 0.1 in some reports, but given the code's simplicity, they should be around 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The only concern is the use of 'import *', which is stylistically discouraged but not security-related.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and not indicative of any security issue.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for poor practice but not security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, routine, and not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate in their assessments, but the malware scores should be zero, and the risk scores should be minimal, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
