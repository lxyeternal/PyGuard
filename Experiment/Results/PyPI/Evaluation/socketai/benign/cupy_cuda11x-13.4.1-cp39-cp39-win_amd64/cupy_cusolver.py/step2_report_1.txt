  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe a simple import of 'cupyx.cusolver' (or from it) and issuing a deprecation warning.\n- No report indicates any external data input, network activity, or data processing.\n- No signs of malicious code, such as code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is noted as poor practice but not malicious.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and indicates maintenance, not security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code only imports a module and issues a warning.\n- No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import ('from cupyx.cusolver import *'), which can cause namespace pollution and make code harder to analyze, but this is a stylistic issue, not a security flaw.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low risk (~0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, higher malware or risk scores are unjustified.\n- The only concern might be the wildcard import, which could cause maintenance or clarity issues but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to poor coding practice, not security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with only a minor stylistic concern regarding the wildcard import. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warning is routine and does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
