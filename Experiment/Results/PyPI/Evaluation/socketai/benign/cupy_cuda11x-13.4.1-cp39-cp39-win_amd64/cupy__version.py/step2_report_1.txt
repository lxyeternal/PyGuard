  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code snippet is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. All reports agree that there are no input/output operations, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious constructs.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a standard, benign version declaration. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is just a static version string assignment, the risk score should remain at 0.5 or below. Assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting that there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that this is a benign, standard practice.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
