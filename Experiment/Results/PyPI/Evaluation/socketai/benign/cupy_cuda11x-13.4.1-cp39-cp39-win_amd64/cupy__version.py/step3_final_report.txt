  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '13.4.1' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string, with no input/output, external calls, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
