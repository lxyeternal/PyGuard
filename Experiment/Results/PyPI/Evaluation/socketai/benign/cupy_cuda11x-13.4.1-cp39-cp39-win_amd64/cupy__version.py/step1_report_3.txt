  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages for version tracking. It is a simple string assignment with no external input, no function calls, no data processing. The content appears straightforward and typical for package metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version indicator with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
