  "flows": "No data flow; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable __version__. There are no input/output operations, no external data reads, or complex logic. It is a standard practice for Python packages to include such a version declaration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare a version identifier. No malicious activity detected.",
