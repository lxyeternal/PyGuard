  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input/output operations, data processing, external calls, or other suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for package version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity is detected or implied.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince all reports agree on the benign nature, there is no justification for assigning higher risk scores. The code is a simple version declaration, a common and safe practice.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity. There is no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nThe reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard metadata declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a typical version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\nGiven the entire context, I agree with the reports' assessments. No additional risks or concerns are warranted.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
