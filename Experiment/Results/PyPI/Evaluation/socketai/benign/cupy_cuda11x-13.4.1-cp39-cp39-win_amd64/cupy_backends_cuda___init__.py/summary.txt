  "conclusion": "The code is mostly benign, with minimal security risks. Dynamic execution functions introduce potential hazards but are not malicious in the current context. Slightly increasing the malware and security risk scores for report 3 would better align with the inherent risks posed by dynamic code execution. Other reports are accurate and consistent. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with appropriate caution for dynamic execution capabilities."
