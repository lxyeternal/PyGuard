  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility function, but no explicit purpose can be conclusively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables, reading files, or receiving data via user input or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, printing to console, executing system commands, or sending data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables, input functions, or file reads to sinks like system commands, network transmission, or file writes, potentially passing through transformations or processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features detected. The code structure is standard with clear function definitions and control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code uses typical Python constructs and standard library functions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network communications with suspicious domains, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are observed. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code appears straightforward and well-structured. Without specific payload or context, no malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and functions as intended without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
