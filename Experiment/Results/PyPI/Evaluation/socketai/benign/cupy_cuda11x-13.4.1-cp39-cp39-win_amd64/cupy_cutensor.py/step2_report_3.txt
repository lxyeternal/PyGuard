  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code imports everything from `cupyx.cutensor` using a wildcard (`from cupyx.cutensor import *`).\n- It issues a `DeprecationWarning` indicating that `cupy.cutensor` is deprecated and suggesting to use `cupyx.cutensor` instead.\n- The code is minimal, with no data processing, input/output, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code correctly issues a deprecation warning.\n- The import statement is a wildcard, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**All reports agree on these points.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward import with a deprecation warning.\n- They correctly note the use of `import *` as poor practice but not malicious.\n- No data flow, sink, or source that indicates malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk: 0.1 or 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Overall, the scores seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the lack of security concerns.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `import *`, which is flagged as poor practice but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, malware score remains at 0.\n- The security risk is minimal; the code could potentially cause maintainability issues but no direct security threat.\n- The obfuscation score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to poor import practice but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, serving only to issue a deprecation warning and perform a module import. The scores reflect this assessment well.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, benign code snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
