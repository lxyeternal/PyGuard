  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal import statement with a deprecation warning.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`from cupyx.cutensor import *`), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice to inform developers.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original. It performs a wildcard import from `cupyx.cutensor` and issues a deprecation warning.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. No malware, no suspicious code, no hidden backdoors.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No input handling, no data processing, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import, which is poor practice but not malicious.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified because the code could be part of a larger, benign codebase.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The highest confidence score is 1, but the risk score remains low, reflecting that the code is not inherently risky.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is straightforward, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, related to poor practice of wildcard import but not security concern)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged because it can hide imported symbols and reduce code clarity, but it does not introduce security risks.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and indicates maintenance rather than malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the reports and analysis, I concur with the provided scores and reasoning. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, acknowledging the poor practice of wildcard import but recognizing it does not pose a security threat.",
