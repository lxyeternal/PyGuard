{
  "purpose": "Import the 'cutensor' module from 'cupyx' and issue a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from cupyx.cutensor import *' reads the entire module; the warnings.warn() function issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the warning is benign and does not affect data flow.",
  "flows": "The import loads module symbols into the namespace; the warning informs users about deprecation but does not influence data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') is poor practice but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and issues a deprecation warning. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The wildcard import is discouraged but not harmful. The warning is standard and benign. No security-sensitive operations or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code's simplicity and benign intent justify a malware score of 0, a low security risk score (~0.1), and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to notify about deprecation and perform a module import. There is no malicious activity or security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
