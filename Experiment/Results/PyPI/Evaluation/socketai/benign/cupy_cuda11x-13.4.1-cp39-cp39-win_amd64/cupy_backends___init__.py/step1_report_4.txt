{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard package initialization or utility functions, possibly related to data processing or system setup.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input functions, or external modules that read files or network data.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like printing, writing to files, or network communication that could leak data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like output functions, with some transformations or validations in between.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements, function definitions, and control flow constructs. It does not include any obfuscated logic, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no data leaks or malicious commands are evident. The code's intent seems benign, focusing on data handling or configuration without malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a normal, non-malicious Python script. However, due to the lack of specific context or potential hidden behaviors in external modules, a low confidence level is maintained.",
