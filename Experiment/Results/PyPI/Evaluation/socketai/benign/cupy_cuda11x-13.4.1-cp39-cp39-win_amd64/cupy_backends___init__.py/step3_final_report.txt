  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flows, based solely on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, function parameters, external data sources, and network/file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, or other external data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), potentially via dynamic code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual control flow patterns. No such anomalies are observed in the provided descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports lacking code correctly assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation, with low risk scores justified by benign descriptions. Reports describing straightforward, non-obfuscated code with no malicious features maintain high confidence (0.8) and low risk (0.2). The reasoning is consistent, and scores align with the absence of suspicious activity. No false positives or unwarranted warnings are present. The assessments are conservative and appropriate given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores and zero malware scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and cautious, reflecting the limited data.",
