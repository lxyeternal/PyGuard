  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, but the exact purpose cannot be determined definitively from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, hardcoded strings, or external libraries; specifics are unclear due to lack of visible input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur at network communication functions, file operations, or environment variable access; exact locations are not explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or external calls) through various functions, possibly reaching network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident in the visible code. Lack of clear purpose or excessive dynamic execution could be suspicious but is not confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step; however, due to the absence of actual code snippets, only general observations can be made. No malicious patterns, suspicious functions, or risky behaviors like code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are clearly identified in the provided fragment. The code appears standard but lacks sufficient detail to rule out malicious intent entirely.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not display clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be typical application logic, though insufficient detail prevents a full assurance. No malware or obfuscation is evident.",
