  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, network sockets, subprocess calls, and variable data assignments.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, subprocess executions, environment variable access, and data handling points where untrusted data could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or network inputs through processing functions to network sockets or subprocess commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network domains, and no malicious code patterns detected; code appears standard with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data processing, network communication, and subprocess management without evidence of malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The use of network and subprocess modules is noted but not malicious in context. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.8), given the lack of suspicious features. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The security risk remains low (0.2), acknowledging potential misuse if connected to untrusted endpoints, but no evidence supports malicious activity. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. Security risks are minimal, primarily related to network and subprocess operations, but no active threats are identified. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified, warranting no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
