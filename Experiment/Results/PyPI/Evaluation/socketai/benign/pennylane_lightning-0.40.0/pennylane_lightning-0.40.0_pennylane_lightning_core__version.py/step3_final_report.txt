  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for the package, serving as metadata for version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not involve data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; it is straightforward license and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a static string assignment (__version__ = \"0.40.0\"). It does not perform any dynamic operations, input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the lack of suspicious elements. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code aligns with standard open-source version modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
