  "purpose": "Provide version information for the package.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment of version string (__version__ = \"0.40.0\")",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows related to untrusted input or external data",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of version info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply contains license comments and assigns a static version string to __version__, with no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard version info module typical in open-source projects. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
