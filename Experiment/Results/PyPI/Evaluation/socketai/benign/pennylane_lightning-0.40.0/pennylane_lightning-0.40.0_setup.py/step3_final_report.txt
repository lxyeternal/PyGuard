  "purpose": "Build setup script for a Python package with CMake extensions, managing platform-specific configurations and invoking external build tools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' for project name, environment variables like 'DEBUG' and 'CMAKE_ARGS', and external commands such as 'cmake', 'ninja', 'brew'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing build commands, copying shared libraries, and environment variables influencing build configuration.",
  "flows": "Source data from 'pyproject.toml' and environment variables flow into subprocess commands and file operations during build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Standard use of subprocess and environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build configuration script for a Python package with CMake extensions. It performs dependency checks, platform-specific adjustments, and invokes external build tools in a controlled manner. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls and environment variable reliance are standard for such scripts. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk 0.1-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured build setup with no malicious intent or security risks. External command invocations and environment dependencies are typical and do not indicate malicious activity. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
