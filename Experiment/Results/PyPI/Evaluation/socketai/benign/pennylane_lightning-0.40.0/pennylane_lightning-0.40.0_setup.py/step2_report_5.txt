  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code, and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a setup script for building a Python package with CMake extensions, involving environment variables, platform-specific configurations, and external build tools.\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily concerned with build configuration, dependency checks, and artifact copying.\n- No report mentions hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- The subprocess calls invoke standard build tools (`cmake`, `ninja`, `brew`), which are typical in such contexts.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate build setup with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; focuses on build setup, dependency check, and version parsing.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Correctly identified; environment variables and subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; no obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard, with a low security risk.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the build context)\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Properly identified; subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity; reliance on external tools is typical.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriate; no malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; again, similar to previous.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Correct; external commands and file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriate; standard build script.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, consistent with build script)\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; detailed description.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Properly identified; subprocess calls and environment influence.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriate; standard build process.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.3 (slightly higher, but still reasonable considering environment manipulation potential)\n\n**Verdict:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; detailed and accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Properly described; external build tools and copying.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; legitimate build setup.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** None detected. The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts, and no suspicious network or data exfiltration activities are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or hidden behaviors.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, reflecting the nature of the script.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.3), consistent with build scripts that rely on environment variables and external tools but do not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, typical build system risks, mainly from external tool reliance)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, legitimate build setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
