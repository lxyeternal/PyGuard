{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module related to PennyLane Lightning, likely part of a quantum computing library, and includes licensing information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (_version), license comments, and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports a version number and contains licensing comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; licensing comments are standard, and the import statement is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing and copyright information followed by a single import statement for a version variable. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The import is from a relative module, indicating internal package structure. The code is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata and import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
