{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for PennyLane Lightning, likely providing version information and module setup for a quantum computing framework.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module _version to access __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or network interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import of version info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, a module docstring, and a single import statement. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. The import of __version__ from a local module is standard practice for versioning and not suspicious. No external calls, no dynamic code execution, no embedded data or secrets. The structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a Python package module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
