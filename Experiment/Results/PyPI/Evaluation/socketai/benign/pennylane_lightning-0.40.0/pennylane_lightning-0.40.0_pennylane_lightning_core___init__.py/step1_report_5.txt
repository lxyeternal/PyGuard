{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for PennyLane Lightning, likely part of a larger quantum computing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ from a local module _version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. The license header is standard and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single import statement for __version__. No input handling, data processing, or suspicious activities are present. The code is minimal and appears to be a harmless module header or metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module header with licensing information and a version import. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
