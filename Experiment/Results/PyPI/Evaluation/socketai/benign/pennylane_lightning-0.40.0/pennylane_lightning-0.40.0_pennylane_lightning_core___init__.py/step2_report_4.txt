  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard module snippet containing licensing comments, a module docstring, and an import statement for `__version__` from a local module `_version`.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, user input handling, external network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The import appears to be a typical pattern for version management within a package.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No report mentions any suspicious code, obfuscated segments, embedded secrets, or hardcoded credentials.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for Python package modules.\n   - No anomalies or unusual behaviors are observed.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Overestimations**:\n   - Since the code is purely static, contains no external calls, and is typical for package setup, there's no reason to increase the malware or obfuscated scores.\n   - The risk score is correctly zero, as there's no evident security threat.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimation**:\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments: the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - I would keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.\n\n**Final conclusion**: The code snippet is a standard, harmless module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
