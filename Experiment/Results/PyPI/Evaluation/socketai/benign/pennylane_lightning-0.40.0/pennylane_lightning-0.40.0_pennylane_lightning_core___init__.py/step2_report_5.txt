  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard module for versioning and licensing.\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments, a module docstring, and an import statement (`from ._version import __version__`).\n   - There are no user inputs, environment variables, network calls, or data processing.\n   - The import is from a local module, which is typical for version management in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code.\n   - No external data flows, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic.\n   - The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and contains no security issues.\n   - No false positives or false negatives are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely for versioning and licensing, and no suspicious behavior is detected, there is no justification for raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n   - The code snippet is a standard, harmless module header with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are thorough and correct. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that accurately. No changes are necessary.",
