{
  "purpose": "Abstract base class for a quantum state-vector simulator device, providing interfaces for state initialization, manipulation, and measurement.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as state vectors, basis states, and operations; external C++ bindings (_qubit_state).",
  "sinks": "Internal state modifications; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal state modifications via methods like _apply_state_vector and _apply_basis_state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured abstract class defining interfaces for quantum state management, relying on external C++ bindings typical for high-performance simulators. Validation checks are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data leaks are present. The reliance on external bindings could, in theory, hide issues, but no evidence supports this. The code's design and content are consistent with legitimate scientific computing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard abstract class for quantum state-vector simulation with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk due to external bindings).",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
