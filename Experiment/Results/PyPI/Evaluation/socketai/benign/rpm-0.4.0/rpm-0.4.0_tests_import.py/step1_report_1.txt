{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple test utility to check the RPM configuration directory and the presence of the RPM spec class.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'rpm' module, which may be a third-party or system library, and uses 'rpm.expandMacro' to obtain configuration information.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the RPM configuration directory, which is a safe operation. There are no other sinks like network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'rpm', calling 'rpm.expandMacro' with a macro, and printing the result. No untrusted input or data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports the 'rpm' module inside a function rather than globally, which is unusual but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The script's sole function is informational. No malicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script's purpose is to perform a basic check on RPM configuration via the 'rpm' module, which is typical in system management scripts. It only logs and prints data, with no network activity or data manipulation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are found. The import inside the function is a minor anomaly but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily used for system configuration checking. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
