      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate system compatibility shim for RPM modules, with no signs of malicious activity. Its dynamic loading capabilities pose some environmental security risks if the filesystem or interpreter paths are compromised. Current scores of malware at 0 and obfuscated at 0 are appropriate; the security risk should be increased to about 0.4 to reflect potential exploitation in untrusted environments."
