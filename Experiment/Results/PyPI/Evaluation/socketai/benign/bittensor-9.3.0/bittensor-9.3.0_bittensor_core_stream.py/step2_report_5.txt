  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a framework for streaming responses with token streamer callable, reading input from 'send' and response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** 'token_streamer' invoked during streaming, data sent via 'send'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. 'token_streamer' is external, which could be malicious if supplied malicious code, but this is expected in plugin architectures.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard framework; risk depends on the 'token_streamer' implementation. No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in content, emphasizing standard ASGI patterns, no malicious behavior, 'token_streamer' is user-supplied.\n- No suspicious logic or external calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the structure, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Highlights that 'token_streamer' is user-provided, which could be risky if untrusted, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment, emphasizing standard design, no malicious behavior.\n- 'token_streamer' is a user-supplied callable, which is expected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reinforces the framework nature, standard patterns, no malicious activity.\n- The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of 'token_streamer'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. The code is a well-structured, abstract framework for streaming responses.\n- **Potential risk:** The main concern is that 'token_streamer' is user-supplied, which could be malicious if the implementation is untrusted. But this is inherent to the design, not a flaw.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** None.\n- **Suspicious network activity or backdoors:** None.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the inherent risk in accepting external callables but not indicating a specific vulnerability.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the nature of the code, I concur with the provided scores. The code itself is safe, and the primary security concern is external trust in the 'token_streamer' implementation.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis is a standard, well-structured framework with no inherent malicious behavior.",
