  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a framework for handling streaming responses, with no evidence of embedded malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The 'token_streamer' is a user-supplied callable, which could be malicious if provided by an untrusted source, but this is a typical pattern in streaming APIs.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or mistakes are identified in the code snippets or the reports.\n- The code structure, including abstract methods and nested classes, aligns with standard async web response patterns.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious behavior or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Consistently low (~0.2), acknowledging that the primary risk stems from the 'token_streamer' being user-supplied.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports or the code suggest any inherent maliciousness or high-risk behavior.\n- The main concern is the potential misuse of the 'token_streamer' callable, which is outside the code's control.\n- Since the code is a framework, its security posture depends on how it is used and what code is supplied as 'token_streamer'.\n\n**5. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware or obfuscation, low security risk, and no anomalies.\n\n**6. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify that vulnerabilities depend on external implementation of 'token_streamer'.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are made; the code is neutral.\n\n**7. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured framework for streaming responses.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The security risk is primarily about external code supplied as 'token_streamer', which is expected in such architectures.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2** (due to reliance on external, potentially untrusted 'token_streamer')  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a clean, standard implementation of an abstract streaming response handler. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'token_streamer' callable, which is external to the code and typical in such designs. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
