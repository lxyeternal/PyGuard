  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured framework for streaming responses with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from external 'token_streamer' code, which is expected in such designs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the reliance on external, potentially untrusted code but no inherent vulnerabilities."
