  "purpose": "The script manages version checking for the Bittensor SDK and optionally executes a shell script named 'certifi.sh'.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), os.path, os.path.exists, os.chmod, subprocess.run, __file__",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes 'certifi.sh'), os.chmod (changes permissions), print (outputs messages)",
  "flows": "sys.argv input → conditional check → if 'certifi' command → execution of 'certifi.sh' via subprocess → otherwise prints version info",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs the path to 'certifi.sh' and executes it, which could be potentially malicious if the file is replaced with a malicious script. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present. The script's purpose depends on the content of 'certifi.sh', which is external.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs version checking and optionally runs an external shell script. It constructs a path to 'certifi.sh' within a 'utils' directory relative to the script's location. If the command-line argument 'certifi' is provided, it checks for the existence of 'certifi.sh', sets its permissions to executable, and executes it using subprocess.run with check=True. If not, it simply prints the installed version and checks for the latest version on PyPI. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The main security consideration is the execution of an external script, which could be malicious if the 'certifi.sh' file is compromised. The code relies on the assumption that 'certifi.sh' is safe and correctly located, but it does not verify the content of the script before execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its structure but relies on an external script ('certifi.sh') that is executed dynamically. If the 'certifi.sh' script is malicious or replaced, it could perform harmful actions. No other malicious indicators or security flaws are evident within this code snippet. The overall security risk depends on the integrity of the external script.",
