  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior internally. The main security risk stems from executing an external script without validation, which could be malicious if the script is compromised. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.4 depending on trust in 'certifi.sh'. To mitigate risks, verifying the script's integrity before execution is recommended."
