  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,

  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates risky practices and obfuscation patterns that raise suspicion of malicious intent, though no definitive malware is confirmed. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with higher concern in obfuscated and dynamic code segments. Overall, the dependency warrants cautious review before use."
