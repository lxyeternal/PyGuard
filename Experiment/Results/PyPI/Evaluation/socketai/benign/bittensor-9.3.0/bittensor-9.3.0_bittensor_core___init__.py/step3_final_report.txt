  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic eval/exec, input handling, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential code injection points via eval/exec, network connections, file system modifications, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, untrusted data) to eval/exec or network/file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, high obfuscation, complex control flow, suspicious encoding, dynamic execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits risky practices such as dynamic eval/exec with untrusted inputs, obfuscation, and complex control flow. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns are common in malicious scripts. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but where code is present, the patterns suggest potential malicious intent. The scores assigned reflect suspicion but do not confirm malware. Obfuscation and dynamic execution are weighted heavily in risk assessment. Overall, the code shows signs of being potentially malicious, especially in highly obfuscated cases, warranting cautious handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates risky practices and obfuscation patterns that raise suspicion of malicious intent, though no definitive malware is confirmed. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with higher concern in obfuscated and dynamic code segments. Overall, the dependency warrants cautious review before use.",
