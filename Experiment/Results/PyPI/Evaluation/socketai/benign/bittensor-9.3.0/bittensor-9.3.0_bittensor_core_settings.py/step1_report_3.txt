  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for a Python package related to the Bittensor network, including environment variables, network endpoints, directories, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READ_ONLY, BT_SUBTENSOR_CHAIN_ENDPOINT, BT_AXON_PORT, etc.), file system paths (WALLETS_DIR, MINERS_DIR), hardcoded network URLs, and version string parsing.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints used for websocket connections, environment variables influencing configuration, directory creation, and versioning data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure network endpoints, ports, and directories; version string is parsed; directories are created if not read-only; environment variables influence application behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for critical configuration, but no suspicious or hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are observed. All network URLs appear legitimate and related to the intended service.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration setup for a networked application, relying heavily on environment variables for customizable endpoints and directories. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are present. Network URLs are standard websocket endpoints for the specific service, and version parsing appears safe. Directory creation is conditional on a 'READ_ONLY' flag. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code's purpose is to initialize parameters and prepare the environment for further application logic, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup script with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles environment-based configuration, directory setup, and version parsing securely and transparently.",
