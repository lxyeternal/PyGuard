  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code to verify claims, assess the reasoning, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is predominantly configuration and setup for a networked Python application, relying heavily on environment variables, directory creation, and version parsing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n- Network endpoints are publicly known and standard for blockchain or WebSocket services.\n- The code includes a conditional import of `nest_asyncio`, which is a common pattern for compatibility in Jupyter notebooks.\n- Version parsing and validation are straightforward and safe.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds the code to be standard configuration with no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies the code as configuration/setup, with no malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is sound; environment variables and network URLs are standard.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk is low, considering the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration, environment variables, and legitimate endpoints.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly notes the absence of suspicious activity.\n- The URLs are legitimate endpoints.\n- The code is standard configuration, no malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Focuses on environment variables, directory setup, and version parsing.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign configuration.\n- No malicious patterns or secrets.\n- The environment variables are used for configuration, which is normal.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing configuration, environment variables, and version parsing.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Well-reasoned; the code is standard setup.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The URLs and environment variable usage are typical.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Again, highlights configuration, environment variables, and network setup.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly interprets the code as benign configuration.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard configuration/setup code.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the security risks are minimal.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed as **0**; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious activity, a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2** is reasonable, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  | Justification                                              |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2    | Standard configuration, no malicious patterns.             |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | Same reasoning, slightly lower risk.                        |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | Clear, benign setup.                                         |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Fully aligned with benign configuration.                   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2    | No suspicious activity, standard environment setup.        |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk. The existing report scores are appropriate.",
