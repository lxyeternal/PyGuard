      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior internally. The main security risk stems from executing an external script without validation, which could be malicious if the script is compromised. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.4 depending on trust in 'certifi.sh'. To mitigate risks, verifying the script's integrity before execution is recommended."

The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with higher concern in obfuscated and dynamic code segments. Overall, the dependency warrants cautious review before use."

No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors is detected. The main concern is the trustworthiness of callback functions, which is a manageable risk in flexible plugin systems. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to callback trust assumptions."

The main risk stems from external 'token_streamer' code, which is expected in such designs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the reliance on external, potentially untrusted code but no inherent vulnerabilities."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard practice. The initial assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate."
