{
  "purpose": "This code appears to handle module attribute access and warnings related to versioning information, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules (.core.settings, .utils.btlogging, .utils.easy_imports), specifically version info and logging utilities.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are evident. The code only issues a warning and raises AttributeError.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version-related data or triggers a warning when 'version_split' is accessed; no untrusted data flows to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to manage deprecated attribute access is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dynamic attribute accessor (__getattr__) that warns users when accessing a deprecated attribute 'version_split' and suggests using '__version__' instead. It imports version info and logging utilities, but does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with standard deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving as a deprecation warning handler for a version attribute. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident.",
