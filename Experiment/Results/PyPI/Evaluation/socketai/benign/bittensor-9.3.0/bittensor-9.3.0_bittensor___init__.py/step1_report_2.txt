  "purpose": "This code provides attribute access handling and warning mechanisms for versioning and imports from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and attributes, particularly '__version__', 'version_split', and others from '.core.settings' and utility modules.",
  "sinks": "The '__getattr__' function could be invoked to access 'version_split', which triggers a warning. No other sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Access to 'version_split' triggers a warning, then returns the attribute. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of '__getattr__' for deprecated attribute handling is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific internal settings and utility modules, then defines a '__getattr__' method that issues a deprecation warning when 'version_split' is accessed. The warning informs users about deprecation and suggests using '__version__' instead. No untrusted data input, external network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be straightforward module management with deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, primarily managing module attributes and issuing deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are detected.",
