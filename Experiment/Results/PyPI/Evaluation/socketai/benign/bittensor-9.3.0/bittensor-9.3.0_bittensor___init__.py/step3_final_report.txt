{
  "purpose": "Manage deprecated attribute access ('version_split') within the module, issuing a warning and raising an AttributeError for unknown attributes.",
  "sources": "Access to the attribute 'version_split' triggers the deprecation warning; internal module imports provide versioning and utility data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks are present; the code only issues warnings and raises exceptions internally.",
  "flows": "Access to 'version_split' flows through __getattr__, leading to a warning; other attribute accesses result in AttributeError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward deprecation handling with standard warnings and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to versioning and utilities, then defines __getattr__ to warn when 'version_split' is accessed and raise AttributeError otherwise. No untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is standard for managing deprecated attributes, with appropriate use of warnings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages deprecated attribute access with standard practices. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
