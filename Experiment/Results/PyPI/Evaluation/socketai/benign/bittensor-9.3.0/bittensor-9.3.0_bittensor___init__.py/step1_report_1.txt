{
  "purpose": "This module appears to manage versioning information and utility imports, providing a deprecation warning for an outdated attribute.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core.settings, .utils.btlogging, .utils.easy_imports).",
  "sinks": "The __getattr__ function returns a deprecated attribute, but there are no sinks involving untrusted data handling or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Access to __getattr__ triggers a warning and returns a deprecated attribute, but no data flows involve external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; use of warnings.warn for deprecated attribute access is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration and utility modules, then defines a __getattr__ method that issues a deprecation warning if 'version_split' is accessed and raises an error otherwise. This is typical for managing deprecated attributes and does not indicate malicious intent. The warnings are for developer awareness, and there are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a deprecated attribute handler with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as expected for managing deprecated attributes with appropriate warnings.",
