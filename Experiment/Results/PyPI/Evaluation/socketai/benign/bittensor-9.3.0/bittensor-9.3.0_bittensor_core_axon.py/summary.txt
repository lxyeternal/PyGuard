  "conclusion": "The code appears secure and well-structured, employing standard cryptographic security measures and request validation techniques. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors is detected. The main concern is the trustworthiness of callback functions, which is a manageable risk in flexible plugin systems. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to callback trust assumptions."
