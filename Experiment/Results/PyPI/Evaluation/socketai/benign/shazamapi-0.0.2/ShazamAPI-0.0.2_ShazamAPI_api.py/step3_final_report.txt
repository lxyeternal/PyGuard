{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes audio data, generates signatures, and sends recognition requests to the Shazam API to identify a song.",
  "sources": "Reads input bytes as songData, generates signatures via SignatureGenerator, and obtains UUIDs and timestamps for API requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests with signature data, UUIDs, and timestamps to the external API endpoint; receives JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Input songData -> normalize audio -> generate signatures -> encode signatures -> send API request with UUIDs and timestamps -> receive response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Infinite loop in recognizeSong() may cause inefficiency but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio normalization, signature generation, and API communication for song recognition. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The use of UUIDs and timestamps is typical. The infinite loop could be optimized but does not constitute malicious activity. External API interactions are legitimate. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a song recognition client with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal external API interaction without suspicious activity.",
