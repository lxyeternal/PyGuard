{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to recognize a song from audio data by generating signatures and sending recognition requests to the Shazam API.",
  "sources": "Reads input song data bytes (`songData`), generates audio signature, and requests to an external API using generated signatures.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests containing encoded signatures and metadata to an external API endpoint; no data is written to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads song data -> normalizes audio -> generates signature -> encodes signature -> sends request to API endpoint -> receives JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external API with dynamically generated UUIDs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no suspicious API domains or hidden network activity detected. Signature generation appears standard; no unusual code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes audio data, generates signatures, and communicates with a well-known API for song recognition. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity detected. The external request uses UUIDs and current timestamps, typical for such services. No suspicious file operations, obfuscated code, or data leaks identified. The purpose and flow align with legitimate functionality; security risks are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs song recognition via external API with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. It adheres to expected operations for such an application, with no suspicious patterns or malware indicators.",
