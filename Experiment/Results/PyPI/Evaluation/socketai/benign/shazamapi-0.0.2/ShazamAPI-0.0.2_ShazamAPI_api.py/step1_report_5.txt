{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to recognize songs by processing audio data, generating signatures, and sending recognition requests to the Shazam API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'songData' bytes provided during class initialization, processes audio with pydub, and retrieves signatures from SignatureGenerator.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via POST requests to the API_URL endpoint, including signature URIs and timestamps. The responses are parsed as JSON.",
  "flows": "Audio data is normalized and fed into the signature generator; signatures are created and encoded into URIs, then sent in HTTP POST requests to the API, with responses returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors. The use of external API and request handling appears standard. Signature generation and audio normalization are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code processes audio data for song recognition using external APIs, with proper data normalization and signature creation. No suspicious or malicious operations are evident, and no unusual code patterns or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is legitimate, and all data flows appear intended for song recognition. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data leakage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for audio recognition using an external API, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks.",
