  "purpose": "A straightforward Python setup script for packaging, reading README.md for description, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows",
  "flows": "Static data read from file used in package setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; minor typo in description ('engeenired') which is non-security relevant",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All dependencies are common, and no anomalies are present. The code is human-readable and straightforward. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor typo does not impact security. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
