{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'ShazamAPI' used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to obtain long description; uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or untrusted data handling. No execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads from file -> Provides package configuration to setuptools -> Defines dependencies and package info.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'reverse engeenired' instead of 'reverse engineered'. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration parameters. There are no code execution, input validation, or network activities that could indicate malicious intent. The only minor concern is a typo in the description, which does not impact security. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical packaging operations with no suspicious elements.",
