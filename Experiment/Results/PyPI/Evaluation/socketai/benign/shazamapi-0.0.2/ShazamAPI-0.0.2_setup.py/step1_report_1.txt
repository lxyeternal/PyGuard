{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'ShazamAPI' with its metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content for description, then proceeds with package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. The setup script is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local Markdown file for description and configures package setup parameters. It specifies dependencies like 'requests', 'pydub', and 'numpy', which are common libraries. No suspicious code, network connections, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware. There are no anomalies or security concerns identified in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
