  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ShazamAPI Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads no other external data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no untrusted input flows into potentially dangerous functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file and uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, nor any indication of malicious behavior. The dependencies are common Python libraries ('requests', 'pydub', 'numpy') that are legitimate. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code strictly performs package setup tasks, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be legitimate.",
