  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The only minor issue noted is a typo in the description (\"reverse engeenired\" instead of \"reverse engineered\") which does not impact security.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description in all reports. No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n- **Malware presence:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied; the code is standard.\n\n### Scoring assessment:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing beyond static file reading.\n- Dependencies are common and benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only minor change would be to correct the typo in the description for professionalism, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1 (very low, as the code is benign but a typo slightly reduces confidence to 0.1)  \n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I would set:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to minor typo, but no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes are necessary beyond minor editorial correction if desired.",
