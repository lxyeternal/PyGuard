{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ShazamAPI', specifying metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; package setup parameters from the 'setuptools.setup' function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' -> 'long_description'; dependencies specified in 'install_requires' -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code follows standard package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a markdown file for the package description, then calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The dependencies listed ('requests', 'pydub', 'numpy') are common and not suspicious in themselves. The code is straightforward, standard for Python packaging, and contains no anomalies or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
