{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be for decoding and encoding a custom audio signature format, likely used for audio fingerprinting or identification.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from binary buffers, decodes from base64 URI, reads header and TLV data structures, and processes frequency peaks.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or manipulates data in binary buffers; however, no explicit data sinks like network transmission or file writing are present in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Decodes binary data from a base64 URI → verifies header and CRC → extracts frequency peaks → reconstructs data → encodes back to binary or URI.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code performs standard binary parsing and encoding. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs binary decoding, validation, and encoding of an audio signature format. It uses CRC checks and structured parsing with standard Python libraries. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration functions are present. No suspicious code patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious logic are identified. All functions and data manipulations appear to be consistent with a data encoding/decoding library for audio signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for decoding and encoding a specific binary audio signature format, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate use.",
