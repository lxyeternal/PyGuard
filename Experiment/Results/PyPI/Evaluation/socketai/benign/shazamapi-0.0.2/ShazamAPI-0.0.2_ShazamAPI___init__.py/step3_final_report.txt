  "purpose": "Import the 'Shazam' class from a local 'api' module, likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.api' to access 'Shazam'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are involved in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import loads the 'Shazam' class into the current namespace; no data flows or execution paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import in Python, typical in modular projects. It does not execute any logic or external communication. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning low malware and security risk scores, and high confidence levels. Without additional context about the 'Shazam' class or 'api' module, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the benign assessment, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is safe and standard, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, unless further context indicates otherwise.",
