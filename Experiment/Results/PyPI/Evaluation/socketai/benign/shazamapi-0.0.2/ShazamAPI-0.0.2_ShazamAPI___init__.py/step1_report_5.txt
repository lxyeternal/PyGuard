  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are visible in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement with relative path; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import from a module named 'api', specifically importing 'Shazam'. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks present. Without additional context, this appears to be a standard import statement. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are evident. The import itself does not indicate malicious intent; it is common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import statement within a package. The minimal nature of the code limits further analysis, but no anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
