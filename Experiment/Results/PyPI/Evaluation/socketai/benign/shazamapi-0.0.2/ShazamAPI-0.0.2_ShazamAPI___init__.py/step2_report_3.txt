  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code in the Snippet**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .api import Shazam`. This is a standard Python import, and in isolation, it does not execute any malicious code or perform any suspicious activity. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify that the code is minimal, only an import statement, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Score Justification and Recommendations**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the code snippet. Since no malicious activity is observed, a malware score of 0 is justified. The small 0.1 in one report could be a conservative buffer, but it should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Similarly, the security risk is minimal. The scores are generally 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable. Given the absence of any executable or data flow, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as unobfuscated (score 0).\n\n**4. Critical Analysis of Potential Risks**  \n- The import statement alone does not pose a security threat.  \n- Without additional context (such as the implementation of `Shazam` or the `api` module), we cannot assess if `Shazam` itself is malicious. However, the reports focus only on this snippet, which is safe.\n\n**5. Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent with the minimal and benign nature of the code.  \n- Slight variations (0.8, 0.9 confidence) are acceptable given the limited context.\n\n**6. Final Assessment and Recommendations**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, but for consistency, I recommend setting the malware and security risk scores explicitly to **0** across all reports.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code.",
