{
  "purpose": "Import the 'Shazam' class or function from the local 'api' module, likely used for interacting with or accessing Shazam-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; no input reading beyond module import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data output or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only a module import statement, no data flow or execution flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a simple import statement with no additional context or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'Shazam' from a relative module 'api'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The import appears straightforward and typical for modular Python projects. Lack of additional code limits the ability to analyze further behaviors or potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple module import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
