  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple import statement: `from .api import Shazam`. There is no additional logic, data handling, or external communication shown.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent in stating that this is a benign import statement.  \n   - They appropriately note the lack of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct given the evidence. The import statement itself does not suggest malicious intent.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly set to 0, as no obfuscation is present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which seems reasonable considering the import could be part of a larger, potentially risky system, but on its own, it's benign.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:  \n   - The reports correctly do not assume malicious intent solely based on the import statement.  \n   - Without additional context—such as the implementation of the `Shazam` class or the contents of the `api` module—there's no basis to suspect malicious activity.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \n   - The scores align well with the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet.  \n   - No report assigns a suspiciously high malware or risk score without evidence.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - If the `Shazam` class or the `api` module contains malicious code, it cannot be inferred from this import statement alone.  \n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the contents of the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (appropriate; no malicious activity detected from the import statement alone)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (appropriate; no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0–0.1 (appropriate; the import itself is harmless, but if the imported module is malicious, the risk could be higher, but that cannot be determined here)\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- To fully assess the security implications, review the implementation of the `Shazam` class and the `api` module.  \n- If the `api` module is from an untrusted source or contains obfuscated/malicious code, the risk assessment should be revisited.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe provided code snippet is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the minimal code shown. No changes are necessary based solely on this snippet.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code as presented.",
