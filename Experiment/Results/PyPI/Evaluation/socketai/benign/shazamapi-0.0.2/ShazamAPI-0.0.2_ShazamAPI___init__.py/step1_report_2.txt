  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Shazam' class or function from a local module named 'api'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, no direct input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns evident. The import path suggests a local module, which is typical for organized projects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function 'Shazam' from a local module within the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data leakage. Since it is only an import statement, it does not perform any actions or contain executable logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. Without further context, this appears to be a benign import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not itself pose any security threat.",
