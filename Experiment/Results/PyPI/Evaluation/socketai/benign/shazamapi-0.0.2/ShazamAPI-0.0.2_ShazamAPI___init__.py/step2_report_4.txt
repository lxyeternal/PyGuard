  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .api import Shazam`.\n   - There is no additional code, data flow, or logic present.\n   - The import is relative, indicating a local module within the same package.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No report mentions any suspicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard for modular Python projects.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis & Conclusions:**\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign import statement.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8–1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is still very low and likely not indicative of actual risk.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, all scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement, it cannot perform malicious actions on its own.\n   - The actual behavior depends on the implementation of the `Shazam` class in the `api` module, which is not provided.\n   - Without further context, there is no basis to suspect malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n   - For a more thorough security assessment, the implementation of `Shazam` in the `api` module should be reviewed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal project risk, but generally 0 is justified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
