  "purpose": "Manage copying of type stub files from a fallback directory to documentation stubs, optionally overwriting existing files, and invoke an external 'docify' tool to generate documentation stubs.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for 'packages/pyright-internal/typeshed-fallback' and 'docstubs' directories; invocation of external 'docify' command.",
  "sinks": "External 'docify' process execution; filesystem deletion and copying operations.",
  "flows": "Reading stub files -> copying or deleting directories -> calling 'docify' with stub directory paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or data leaks; standard filesystem and process operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem management for documentation stubs and calls an external documentation generator. No malicious code, network activity, or credential handling is present. External 'docify' invocation is controlled and presumed safe. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The logic is straightforward, with conditional directory removal and copying, followed by a subprocess call. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build utility for managing documentation stubs, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The external 'docify' tool's trustworthiness is assumed but not evidenced as malicious. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal filesystem and process operations typical in build scripts.",
