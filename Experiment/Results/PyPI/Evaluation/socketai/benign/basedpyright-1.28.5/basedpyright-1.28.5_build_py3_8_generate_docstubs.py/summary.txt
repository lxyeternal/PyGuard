  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build utility for managing documentation stubs, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The external 'docify' tool's trustworthiness is assumed but not evidenced as malicious. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal filesystem and process operations typical in build scripts."
