{
  "purpose": "The script adds docstrings to stub files for compiled modules to aid type checking and documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem for existing directories and files, and the `docify` function invocation.",
  "sinks": "The `copytree`, `rmtree`, and `docify` calls perform filesystem modifications and potentially execute external processes.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and manipulations lead to copying directories; `docify` processes the stub files in-place.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of `rmtree` and `copytree` is standard for filesystem operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages filesystem directories: it deletes and copies stub files based on the `overwrite` flag, then runs an external documentation generator (`docify`) on the stubs. The code appears straightforward and intended for documentation purposes. The external `docify` function's behavior is unknown, but it is imported from a presumably legitimate package. No network, credential handling, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard filesystem management script for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
