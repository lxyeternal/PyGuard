{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, but without additional context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, possibly from user input or system data, and from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file operations, or output functions, but these are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules into processing functions, with potential outputs or network calls depending on further code not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are visible in this snippet. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It relies on standard libraries and environment variables. Without external code or network activity shown, no malicious behavior is evident. The lack of context limits the assessment, but based on visible content, there are no clear signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but full confidence is limited due to missing context.",
