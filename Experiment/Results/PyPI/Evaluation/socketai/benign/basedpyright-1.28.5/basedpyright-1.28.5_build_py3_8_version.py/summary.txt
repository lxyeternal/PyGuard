  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for version management. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. The only potential issue is the absence of input validation, which could cause data corruption but not security breaches. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
