Adjustments to security risk scores for Reports 2 and 4 improve alignment with observed evidence. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk."

Without further context, the risk remains low, but caution is advised if 'run' executes code or performs network operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a slightly elevated security risk score (~0.3) is justified to account for the dependency on 'run'."

The risk score should be adjusted slightly higher (~0.4) to account for potential misuse, but overall, the code is straightforward and not malicious."

The external 'docify' tool's trustworthiness is assumed but not evidenced as malicious. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal filesystem and process operations typical in build scripts."

The only potential issue is the absence of input validation, which could cause data corruption but not security breaches. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
