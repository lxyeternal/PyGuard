{
  "purpose": "The code appears to facilitate the execution of a Node.js script from within a Python environment, likely as part of a larger system or automation process.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (input parameters), __file__ (current script file path)",
  "sinks": "node() function execution, which runs a JavaScript file via Node.js",
  "flows": "sys.argv → node() (with script path and arguments), script path constructed from __file__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or unusual language features. The code simply constructs a path to a JavaScript file and executes it.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and a specific 'node' function. It defines a 'run' function that takes a script name, constructs a path to a JavaScript file based on the current script's directory, and executes it using the node() function, passing along any additional command-line arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic appears straightforward, serving as a bridge to execute JavaScript scripts from Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple wrapper to run JavaScript files using Node.js, based on a provided script name. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks within this snippet.",
