{
  "purpose": "To run a Node.js script from a Python environment by invoking a JavaScript file using a node executable.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), __file__ (script location), node (imported from nodejs_wheel.executable)",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() (terminates the process with the result of node execution)",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are passed to the Node.js script via sys.argv; the script path is constructed from the script's directory and filename; the node function executes the script, and sys.exit terminates the process with the script's exit code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected; straightforward invocation of a subprocess",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to execute a JavaScript file using a node executable. It constructs the path to the JavaScript file based on the current script's location. It then invokes the node executable with the script and command-line arguments, and terminates the Python process with the exit code of the script. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. It functions as a bridge to run Node.js scripts from Python.\n\nThe code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of integrating Node.js scripts into a Python workflow without any signs of malicious activity or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility to run Node.js scripts from Python and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues. It reads command-line arguments, executes a script, and exits accordingly. There are no suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
