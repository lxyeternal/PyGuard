{
  "purpose": "The code executes a Node.js script with command-line arguments, acting as a launcher or wrapper for Node.js scripts.",
  "sources": "The script reads the script name from the function parameter and uses __file__ to determine the script path; it also reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The sys.exit() call with the output of node() could terminate the process; executing external scripts based on parameters might lead to command injection if script_name is manipulated.",
  "flows": "script_name parameter → Path(__file__).parent / script_name.js → node() execution → sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code dynamically constructs and executes external scripts based on input, which could be risky if script_name is untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a custom nodejs_wheel.executable node function. It defines a run() function that constructs a path to a JavaScript file based on the script_name argument and executes it using node(), passing along command-line arguments. The use of sys.exit() ensures the program terminates after execution. There is a potential risk if script_name is derived from untrusted input, leading to arbitrary script execution. However, within this code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward script launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Node.js script launcher, with no clear signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk depends on how script_name is provided; if untrusted input is used without validation, it could pose a risk of executing arbitrary scripts. Overall, it is a benign script launcher but warrants caution if script_name originates from untrusted sources.",
