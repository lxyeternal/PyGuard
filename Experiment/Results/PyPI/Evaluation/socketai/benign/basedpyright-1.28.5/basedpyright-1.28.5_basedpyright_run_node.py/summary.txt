  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for launching Node.js scripts but poses a security risk if script_name is untrusted due to lack of validation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should be adjusted slightly higher (~0.4) to account for potential misuse, but overall, the code is straightforward and not malicious."
