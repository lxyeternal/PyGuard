{
  "purpose": "Execute a JavaScript file via Node.js, passing command-line arguments, based on a provided script name.",
  "sources": "script_name parameter, sys.argv[1:] command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "node() function executing the script, potentially invoking a subprocess with untrusted input",
  "flows": "script_name (from parameter) -> path construction -> node() execution with arguments",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization on script_name; direct use of untrusted input in path and subprocess call",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to a JavaScript file based on the script_name parameter and executes it using the node() function, then exits. It does not validate or sanitize script_name, which could allow execution of arbitrary scripts if script_name is influenced by an attacker. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious code. The primary security concern is the potential for executing malicious scripts if inputs are untrusted. Malware scores are correctly assigned as 0, and obfuscation scores as 0. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4), reflecting the risk posed by unvalidated input. To mitigate this, input validation or sanitization should be implemented, especially if script_name can be influenced externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for launching Node.js scripts but poses a security risk if script_name is untrusted due to lack of validation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should be adjusted slightly higher (~0.4) to account for potential misuse, but overall, the code is straightforward and not malicious.",
