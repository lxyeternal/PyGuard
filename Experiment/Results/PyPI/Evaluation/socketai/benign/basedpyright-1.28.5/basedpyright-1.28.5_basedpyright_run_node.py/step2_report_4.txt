  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code's primary function is to execute a JavaScript file via Node.js, passing command-line arguments.\n- None of the reports detect obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code within the snippet.\n- The main concern raised is the potential for security risks if 'script_name' is influenced by untrusted input, leading to arbitrary script execution.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Behavior:\n\n- The code constructs a path to a JavaScript file based on the provided 'script_name' and the current directory.\n- It calls the 'node()' function (imported from 'nodejs_wheel.executable') to execute the script.\n- It terminates the process with 'sys.exit()' after execution.\n- No input validation or sanitization is performed on 'script_name' or 'sys.argv', which could be a security concern if these inputs are untrusted.\n\n### Are the issues reported present?\n\n- **Yes.** The potential for executing malicious scripts exists if 'script_name' is controlled by an attacker, as there's no validation or sanitization.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the potential security risk but do not overstate the maliciousness. They avoid labeling the code as malicious but highlight the risk.\n- They mention that the code does not contain obfuscation or signs of malicious behavior, which is accurate.\n- The reports seem consistent and reasonable in their assessment.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which seems reasonable considering the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n\n- Given the code's straightforwardness and the lack of malicious intent, scores seem appropriate.\n- The risk score could be slightly higher if 'script_name' is untrusted, but the current scores are reasonable.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent but emphasize the importance of input validation.\n- The code itself is a simple script launcher, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, due to potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all factors, I agree with the reports' assessments. The core concern is the potential for executing malicious scripts if 'script_name' is untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus and the code's behavior.",
