{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal launcher that invokes the 'run' function from an external module with a static argument 'index'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the hardcoded string 'index' passed to 'run()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'run()' function, which may execute commands or perform actions based on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The source ('index') flows into the 'run()' function, which may process or execute it, depending on its internal behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'run' function and calls it with a static argument. The implementation of 'run()' is unknown, which is critical for security assessment. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed directly. The code does not contain obfuscation or secrets. The risk depends entirely on 'run()' behavior. Given the static argument and lack of suspicious code, the likelihood of malicious activity from this snippet is very low. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is conservatively set at 0.2 to account for potential malicious behavior within 'run()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the implementation of the external 'run()' function. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified; no modifications are necessary.",
