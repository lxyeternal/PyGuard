  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign; the primary concern is the behavior of the 'run' function. Without further context, the risk remains low, but caution is advised if 'run' executes code or performs network operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a slightly elevated security risk score (~0.3) is justified to account for the dependency on 'run'."
