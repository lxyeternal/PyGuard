  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, or code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, data processing, or dynamic code evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation indicators such as dynamic execution, inconsistent naming, or hidden logic; absence of code in some reports; moderate suspicion scores in Report 4.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, consistent scoring, and high confidence. Report 4 shows moderate suspicion with higher obfuscation and malware scores, justified by indicators like dynamic code features. Missing or empty code in Report 2 limits analysis but scores remain low. Scores are generally aligned with the summaries, with slight adjustments recommended for Report 2's security risk score. Overall, the code appears safe with minimal risk, with some caution in Report 4.",
  "conclusion": "The code dependencies are predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity. The suspicion in Report 4 warrants attention but does not justify high malware scores. Adjustments to security risk scores for Reports 2 and 4 improve alignment with observed evidence. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk.",
