  "conclusion": "The code dependencies are predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity. The suspicion in Report 4 warrants attention but does not justify high malware scores. Adjustments to security risk scores for Reports 2 and 4 improve alignment with observed evidence. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk."
