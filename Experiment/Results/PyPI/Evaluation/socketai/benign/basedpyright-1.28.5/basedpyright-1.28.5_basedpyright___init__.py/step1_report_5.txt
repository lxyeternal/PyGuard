  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit comments indicating its purpose. It might perform some data processing or utility functions, but without further context, its primary goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external files (if any are present). Specific sources cannot be identified without actual code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions, depending on code contents. No suspicious sinks detected without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks could include untrusted input being written to files, sent over the network, or used in system commands. No explicit flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of specific code snippets. Assuming typical Python code, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No indicators of malware or security risks found. Further review requires actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, non-suspicious Python code, with no evident supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
