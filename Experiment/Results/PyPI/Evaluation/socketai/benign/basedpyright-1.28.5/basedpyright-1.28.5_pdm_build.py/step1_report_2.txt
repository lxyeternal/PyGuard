{
  "purpose": "The code defines a build hook for the PDM package manager that automates npm build processes and file management during the build process.",
  "sources": "Reads package.json files, configuration settings, and filesystem data (e.g., reading text files, copying files, reading directory contents).",
  "sinks": "File copying and copying directory trees, updating the files dictionary with package files and scripts, running npm commands.",
  "flows": "Reads package.json and configuration -> executes npm commands -> copies files/directories based on target -> updates files dictionary with package contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. Use of subprocess-like npm commands is standard; no malicious commands detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code performs standard package build operations with no data exfiltration, network communication, or system tampering functions.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a build hook that runs npm commands and copies package files based on build target. It uses the 'npm' module to run npm scripts securely, and copies package.json and distribution files to specified directories, updating the files dictionary accordingly. It conditionally generates documentation stubs and handles both editable and non-editable build targets properly. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The overall functionality aligns with typical build automation tasks without indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard build operations for a Python project integrating npm workflows. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate build script with normal file management and command execution.",
