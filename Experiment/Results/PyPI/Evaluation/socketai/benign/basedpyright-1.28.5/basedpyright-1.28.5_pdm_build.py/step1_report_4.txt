{
  "purpose": "This code defines a build hook for the pdm build system that interacts with npm packages, runs build scripts, and copies files accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads package.json content, reads text from filesystem (package.json, dist directory), reads environment/config settings via context and config_settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess calls via npm() function, copies files (copy, copyfile, copytree), modifies the 'files' dict, reads package.json data.",
  "flows": "Reads package.json -> Runs npm commands -> Copies or modifies files based on build target -> Updates 'files' dict for build system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution. The npm commands and file copying appear standard for build processes.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with npm to install dependencies and build CLI scripts, then copies files and directories depending on build target. It uses standard library functions and well-known external libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications. The process involves legitimate build steps like running 'npm ci' and copying files, which are typical in package build workflows. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build hook for a Python project involving npm packages. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The operations are standard for managing build artifacts and dependencies.",
