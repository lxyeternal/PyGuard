  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard build automation tasks: reading package.json, executing npm commands, copying files/directories, and updating a files dictionary.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution, are identified.\n- The npm commands used ('ci', 'run build:cli:dev') are typical build steps.\n- File copying operations are standard but could pose risks if source files contain sensitive data—however, this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code is well-structured and aligns with common build process practices.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads 'package.json', accesses config, reads files from 'dist'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Runs npm commands, copies files/directories, updates 'files'.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses 'load_text()' without validation; copies entire directories, potentially including sensitive files.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious activity. Slight concern about copying all files without filtering, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build operations.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Focuses on interactions with npm, copying files based on build target.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- Scores are consistent; malware remains 0.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous, with emphasis on npm commands and copying files.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Slightly higher confidence (1.0) and a very low security risk score (0.1).\n- No obfuscation or malware.\n- The description aligns with a straightforward build script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0. There are no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation but generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risks of copying entire directories without filtering, but not indicating a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard build operations, minimal risk, but some caution regarding copying all files without validation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical build hook script with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.0, and set the security risk score at around 0.2 to reflect the potential for sensitive data copying but no actual security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate build automation script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
