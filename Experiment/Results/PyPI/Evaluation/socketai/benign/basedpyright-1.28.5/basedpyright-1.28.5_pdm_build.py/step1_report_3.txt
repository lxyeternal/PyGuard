  "purpose": "This code is part of a build hook for the PDM package manager, orchestrating npm and file operations during package build/update processes.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'package.json' file, reads directory contents with rglob, reads configuration settings, and loads text from a file.",
  "sinks": "Calls npm commands, copies files and directories, modifies the 'files' dictionary which affects build output.",
  "flows": "Reads 'package.json' -> runs npm commands -> copies files/directories or updates the files dictionary depending on build target.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; uses standard library functions and external tools securely. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with external processes (npm), reads and copies project files, and updates build file lists. The npm commands executed are 'ci' and 'run build:cli:dev', which are typical build steps. The script dynamically copies files based on the build target. No indications of malicious activity, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be a straightforward build hook with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a build hook for preparing package files, executing npm commands, and managing build artifacts. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured and standard for a build process.",
