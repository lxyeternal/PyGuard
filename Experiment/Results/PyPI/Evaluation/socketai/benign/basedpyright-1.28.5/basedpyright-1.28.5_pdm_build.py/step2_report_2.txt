  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code performs standard build automation tasks: reading package.json, executing npm commands, copying files/directories, and updating a 'files' dictionary.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or network activity is evident.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- The npm commands used ('ci', 'run build:cli:dev') are typical build steps.\n- File copying involves entire directories, which could include sensitive files, but this is typical for build scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- The code's logic aligns with standard practices for build hooks.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate description.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly notes no validation of 'package.json' content, but this is standard for build scripts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard build automation with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code structures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a standard build process.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no concerns about malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes legitimate build steps.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as standard build automation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The very low risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code doesn't exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting low security risk. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9 or 1.0), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Personal Estimation**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a typical build hook with no security concerns.",
