  "conclusion": "The code is a standard debugging utility for SQLAlchemy in Pyramid, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is executing SQL from request data, which could be exploited if endpoints are publicly accessible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are appropriate given the context. Overall, it poses minimal security threat in a controlled environment but should be protected in production."
