  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical, benign debugging toolbar with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The use of secure token generation and response injection is standard for such tools. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to response modification, which is expected in debugging contexts. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate and justified."
