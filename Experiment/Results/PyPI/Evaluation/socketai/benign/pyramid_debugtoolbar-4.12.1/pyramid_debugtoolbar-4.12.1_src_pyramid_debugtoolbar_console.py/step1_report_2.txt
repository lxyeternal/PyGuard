  "purpose": "Provides an interactive debug console with HTML escaping and thread-local output streams for web debugging environments.",
  "sources": "Reads input source code for execution, reads traceback information, and accesses sys.stdout and sys.displayhook.",
  "sinks": "Executes source code via runcode, writes traceback summaries and output to sys.stdout, modifies sys.displayhook, and accesses traceback rendering functions.",
  "flows": "Input code is compiled and stored; code execution and tracebacks flow to sys.stdout; output flows through thread-local streams with HTML escaping.",
  "anomalies": "Use of thread-local storage and dynamic code registration are normal for interactive consoles; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a thread-safe, HTML-escaped interactive console environment with custom stream handling. It wraps code compilation to track sources, overrides sys.displayhook to display HTML-safe representations, and manages traceback rendering. All functions and classes serve standard debugging purposes without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The use of thread-local streams and dynamic code registration are standard in such environments. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements a secure, thread-safe, HTML-escaped interactive debug console without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate debugging tool with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
