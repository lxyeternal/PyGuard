  "purpose": "Provides traceback rendering, source code inspection, and exception formatting for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.exc_info(), frame locals and globals, source files, external network via xmlrpclib in paste()",
  "sinks": "HTML rendering, logging to stderr, network transmission in paste()",
  "flows": "Source data (traceback, source files, exception info) flows into rendering functions and eval() execution within frames",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in Frame.eval() which can execute arbitrary code; external network call in paste() that could leak data if misused",
  "analysis": "The code is a debugging utility for traceback visualization and source inspection. eval() is used to evaluate code within frames, which poses a security risk if untrusted input is evaluated. The network call in paste() uploads traceback info externally, which could leak sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and intended for development use, not production security. The use of eval() and external network activity are known risks but are typical in debugging tools. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2-0.4) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard debugging utility with inherent risks due to eval() and network activity but no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's purpose. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found.",
