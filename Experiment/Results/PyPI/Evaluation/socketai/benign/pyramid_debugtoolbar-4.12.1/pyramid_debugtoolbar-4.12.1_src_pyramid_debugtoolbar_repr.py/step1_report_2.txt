{
  "purpose": "The code provides debugging representations of Python objects as HTML for inspecting object structures during development or debugging.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input objects passed to functions such as dump(), repr(), and from sys._getframe() for local variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data includes outputs to sys.stdout._write, which could include untrusted data, but no external network or file operations are present. No external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow through representation functions (repr, dump_object, dump_locals), generating HTML output that is written to sys.stdout or returned as strings. No external data flows such as network or file operations are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code uses regex, custom object representation, and HTML formatting, but all appear to serve debugging purposes. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTML representations of Python objects for debugging, utilizing various type-specific formatting methods. It handles sequences, mappings, regex, and basic types, and includes a fallback for exceptions during representation. It reads local variables from frames for introspection. The module is purely for debugging output with no network access, file writes, or malicious data handling. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, external communications, or include malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe debugging utility designed to generate HTML representations of Python objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
