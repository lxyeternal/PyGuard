{
  "purpose": "Provides HTML representations for debugging objects, exceptions, and help content, facilitating detailed inspection during development.",
  "sources": "Reads data from object attributes, sys._getframe for local variables, and user input via pydoc.help.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTML-formatted strings to sys.stdout._write, which is used in a controlled debugging environment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object attributes or local frames through repr methods to sys.stdout._write for display.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.stdout._write and sys._getframe, which are environment-specific debugging features; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard debugging utility that generates HTML representations of objects and exceptions. It relies on common Python introspection functions and safe HTML escaping. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of sys.stdout._write and sys._getframe is typical in debugging contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden backdoors. The minor reliance on environment-specific functions just slightly elevates the security risk score but remains within acceptable bounds for debugging tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard debugging utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight environment-dependent risk is justified and does not pose a real security threat.",
