  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging extension employing advanced techniques like monkeypatching. While monkeypatching core framework classes can introduce security risks if misused or environment is compromised, the current implementation appears controlled and intended for debugging purposes. No malicious activity is detected. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential security implications of monkeypatching core components."
