  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, importing modules and setting a version string.\n- No input/output handling, no data processing, no dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The only dynamic operation is retrieving the version via `_version.get_versions()[\"version\"]`.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, only imports and version assignment.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified, no malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package init, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but the reasoning states no malicious intent, just the version retrieval.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The only \"risk\" could be from the version retrieval, but it's benign. A score of 0.1 is acceptable, but perhaps a 0.0 would be more precise since no actual security concern exists.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Comments:** The report is consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Similar to previous analyses, straightforward imports and version assignment.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correct reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion: a typical __init__.py with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Again, a standard package initialization.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malware or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only minor point is that some reports assign a security risk of 0.1, which could be slightly inflated given the benign nature. A risk score of 0.0 might be more accurate, but 0.1 is still acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign __init__.py for a Python package. No security issues or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with a slight room for lowering the security risk score to zero, but this does not significantly impact the overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. All reports correctly conclude this, and the scores reflect that understanding.",
