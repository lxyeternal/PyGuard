  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports modules and sets version info.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues found; the reasoning is sound.  \n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of external data handling and malicious code.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk:** All scores are 0, with a slight security risk score of 0.1, justified by the minimal risk associated with version retrieval.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues; reasoning is appropriate.  \n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard import structure, no suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Potential issues:** None.  \n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; straightforward imports, no dynamic code execution or data handling.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros, matching the benign nature.  \n- **Potential issues:** None.  \n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign package initialization with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros, as expected.  \n- **Potential issues:** None.  \n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, mainly importing modules and setting version info. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified due to the version retrieval, but even that is negligible.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
