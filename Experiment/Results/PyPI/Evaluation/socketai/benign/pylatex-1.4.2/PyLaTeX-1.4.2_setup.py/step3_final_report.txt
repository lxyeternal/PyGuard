  "purpose": "This setup script manages dependencies, performs environment checks, and executes source code conversion between Python 2 and 3 using external tools for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads version info, environment variables, and file contents; executes subprocess commands for '3to2', 'pasteurize', and a custom shell script.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess calls that run code conversion tools; no untrusted data is executed directly.",
  "flows": "Source data (version info, environment variables) influences conditional subprocess execution for code conversion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke external tools ('3to2', 'pasteurize', 'convert_to_py2.sh') for source code conversion; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks, manages dependencies based on Python version, and conditionally runs external tools for source code conversion. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. External subprocess calls are standard for maintaining compatibility, and no untrusted input is executed. The subprocess commands are controlled and depend on environment conditions, reducing risk. The overall structure is typical for setup scripts with environment-aware features.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package, with external tools used appropriately for source code conversion. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to reliance on external tools, which should be verified for integrity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2.",
