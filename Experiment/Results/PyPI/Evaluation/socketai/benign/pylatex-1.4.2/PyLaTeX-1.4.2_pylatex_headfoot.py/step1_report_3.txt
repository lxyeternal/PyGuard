  "purpose": "This module implements classes for creating and customizing LaTeX headers and footers, specifically for page styles using the 'fancyhdr' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base_classes, .package, and .utils modules; no external data input handling; internal data assigned via class constructors.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs LaTeX command strings and appends them to data structures; no untrusted external data processing, network operations, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Class constructors and methods generate LaTeX commands and append them to internal data structures, primarily using fixed strings or provided parameters. No flow from untrusted input to dangerous commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses LaTeX command generation with no external data execution or injection points. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to generate LaTeX styles and commands for page headers and footers, utilizing safe parameter handling. It uses straightforward string concatenation and method calls to build LaTeX commands. No network access, file I/O, or untrusted input processing is observed. The purpose appears solely to generate LaTeX code for document formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard implementation for LaTeX document styling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely to generate LaTeX commands for page styling without any malicious intent.",
