  "purpose": "Provides version metadata information by parsing a static JSON string generated by 'versioneer.py'.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string 'version_json' embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function parsing the static JSON string; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "The static JSON string is loaded via json.loads() and returned as a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string with version info, including date, revision ID, and 'dirty' flag. The function get_versions() parses this string with json.loads() and returns the resulting dictionary. There are no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code appears auto-generated by 'versioneer.py' and is typical for version management. No security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation are present. The JSON data is static and benign, and the code's purpose is solely to provide version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and auto-generated, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward version info loader. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
