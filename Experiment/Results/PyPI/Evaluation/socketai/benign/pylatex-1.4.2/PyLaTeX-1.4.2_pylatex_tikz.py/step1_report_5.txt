  "purpose": "The code defines classes for constructing and managing TikZ and PGFPlots graphics in LaTeX, including coordinates, nodes, paths, and plots.",
  "sources": "Input data includes string parameters for coordinates, path types, node identifiers, and options; user-supplied coordinate strings and options.",
  "sinks": "Methods such as __repr__, dumps, and string concatenations generate LaTeX commands. No direct data leaks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings or objects are parsed and converted into LaTeX code representations; data flows from user input through parsing and object methods into LaTeX command strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No use of environment variables, system calls, or network operations is observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of LaTeX TikZ and PGFPlots classes, with parsing of coordinate strings, construction of LaTeX commands, and data encapsulation. The regex matches coordinate patterns. The classes do not perform external calls, network activities, or data exfiltration. All data processing occurs locally within class methods. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign library for LaTeX diagram construction. It contains no malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
