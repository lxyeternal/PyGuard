  "purpose": "The code provides classes for constructing and representing TikZ and PGFPlots LaTeX diagrams and commands, including coordinates, nodes, paths, and plots.",
  "sources": "No input reading; static class definitions. No data input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; functions mainly generate LaTeX code strings. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code constructs strings for LaTeX code without executing external commands or performing system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unusual language features. The code appears to be a straightforward LaTeX diagram generation library.",
  "analysis": "The module defines various classes for creating TikZ diagrams and PGFPlots plots, including coordinate parsing, path building, and rendering commands. It uses regular expressions for coordinate string parsing but does not execute or evaluate external input. No network connections, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears well-structured and focuses solely on LaTeX code generation. No suspicious behavior or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured LaTeX diagram class library with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It only constructs LaTeX strings for diagram rendering and does not perform any harmful actions.",
