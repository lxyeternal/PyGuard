  "purpose": "Converts 'quantities' objects to LaTeX strings formatted for SIunitx, including unit translation and uncertainties.",
  "sources": "Uses 'quantity' argument and 'quantities' package internally.",
  "sinks": "Generates LaTeX strings, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input flows into formatting functions, output as LaTeX strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "Standard data transformation; no malicious behavior detected. The code performs straightforward formatting of quantities, handling uncertainties, and translating units via a static dictionary. No external data, network activity, or code execution is present. The import of 'quantities' is standard and trusted. The logic is clear, purpose-driven, and relies on well-known packages. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting quantities into LaTeX for documentation purposes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
