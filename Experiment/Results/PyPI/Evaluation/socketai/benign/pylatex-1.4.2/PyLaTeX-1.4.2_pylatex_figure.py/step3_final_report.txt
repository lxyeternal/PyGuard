  "purpose": "This code manages LaTeX figure environments, allowing addition of images and plots, with utilities for saving plots and handling filenames securely.",
  "sources": "Filenames provided to add_image and add_plot methods, data from matplotlib plotting functions, user-supplied options such as width and placement.",
  "sinks": "plt.savefig writes image files to temporary directories; LaTeX commands generate includegraphics with sanitized filenames; no external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input filenames and options -> filename processing via fix_filename() -> saving plots/images with plt.savefig() -> LaTeX commands include images with options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected. Use of uuid and temp directories is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for LaTeX figure management, including safe filename handling, temporary file creation, and image inclusion. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The filenames are sanitized, and plots are saved in temporary directories, reducing persistent risk. External libraries are used appropriately. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for managing figures and images in LaTeX documents, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard utility module.",
