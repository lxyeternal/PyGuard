The minimal risk pertains to handling untrusted input in LaTeX commands, which is standard in such systems. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0 to 0.2). Overall, the code is safe for its intended purpose."
