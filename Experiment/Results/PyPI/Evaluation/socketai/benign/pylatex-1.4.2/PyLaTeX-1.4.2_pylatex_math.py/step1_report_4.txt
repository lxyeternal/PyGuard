{
  "purpose": "The code provides LaTeX environment and command classes for mathematical content rendering, including alignments, matrices, vectors, and inline math.",
  "sources": "Input data in the Math class (via 'data' parameter), vector names, and matrices passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Dumps methods generating LaTeX strings; no untrusted data execution or system command calls.",
  "flows": "Data inputs (e.g., 'data', 'name', 'matrix') flow into class constructors, then into dump methods generating LaTeX output; no external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code imports numpy dynamically within methods, which is acceptable for optional dependencies. No malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for LaTeX mathematical environments with typical parameters. It does not process external untrusted input in a way that leads to code execution or data exfiltration. The numpy import is local and used solely for formatting matrices. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of LaTeX math environment classes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for rendering math content and does not perform any harmful operations.",
