  "purpose": "Provides a command-line driver for Paver build tool, issuing a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports modules and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning suggests code maintenance, not malicious activity. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and paver.tasks modules, issues a deprecation warning about 'paver.command', and calls paver.tasks.main(). There are no input or data processing flows, no external data handling, and no suspicious operations. The warning indicates deprecation, which is a normal development practice. No malicious or anomalous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard code for a command-line driver with a deprecation warning. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
