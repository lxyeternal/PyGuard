{
  "purpose": "A minimal command-line driver that issues a deprecation warning and delegates execution to paver.tasks.main()",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports warnings and paver.tasks modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; no data leaks or malicious effects are present",
  "flows": "The code issues a warning and then calls paver.tasks.main(), delegating control without data flow to external modules",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward wrapper that warns about deprecation and delegates to an external task manager. It does not process user input, handle external data, or perform any dynamic or malicious actions. The reliance on paver.tasks is standard for build tools. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple wrapper with a deprecation warning. The scores are appropriate and reflect the minimal security concern.",
