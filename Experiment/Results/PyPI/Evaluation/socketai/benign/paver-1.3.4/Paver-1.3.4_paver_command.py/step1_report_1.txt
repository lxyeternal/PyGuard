  "purpose": "A command-line driver script for Paver, a Python-based build automation tool.",
  "sources": "The script reads import statements and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the script only issues a warning and calls a function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module 'paver.command' and issuing a deprecation warning. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and paver.tasks, issues a deprecation warning indicating 'paver.command' is deprecated, and then calls paver.tasks.main(). There is no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data transmission. The warning is informational and does not perform any malicious activity. The code is straightforward, primarily serving as a wrapper to execute the main function from paver.tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious wrapper script that handles deprecation warnings and invokes the main build task. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident.",
