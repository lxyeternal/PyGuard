  "conclusion": "The code is standard automation for build and deployment processes with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security issues relate to insecure permission settings and handling of untrusted inputs, which could be exploited but do not constitute malware. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), justified by implementation flaws rather than malicious activity."
