  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script or module potentially involved in data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, environment variables, or possibly external files or inputs (exact sources cannot be determined as the code is missing).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network calls, file operations, or system commands, but specifics cannot be determined without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like output functions or external systems, but detailed flow cannot be identified without code content.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected based on the provided information. Lack of code detail limits detection of subtle issues.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of the actual code content, a detailed analysis is limited. No suspicious behaviors, malicious patterns, or security risks can be confidently identified without further code details. The code appears to be standard but cannot be fully evaluated.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no clear indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but insufficient detail prevents a definitive assessment. Additional code content is needed for a thorough review.",
