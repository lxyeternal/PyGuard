  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent with their findings. Report 4's high suspicion is justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation. Report 1's initial malware score is slightly conservative; increasing it to 0.4 improves accuracy given the signs of obfuscation and data exfiltration potential. Other reports correctly identify benign or insufficiently detailed code. Overall, the security risk remains moderate for suspicious code and low for benign or absent code. The adjusted scores better reflect the observed behaviors and potential risks."
