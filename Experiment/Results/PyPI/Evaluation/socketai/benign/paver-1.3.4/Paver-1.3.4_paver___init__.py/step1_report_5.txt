  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or package, but no specific purpose is evident due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of input or data are visible in the provided content.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious or insecure data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or eval statements are apparent.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is entirely empty, containing no logic, variables, or function definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code; therefore, there are no data sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of code also means no potential malicious or suspicious behaviors are detectable. Without code content, we cannot identify any anomalies or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the empty input, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign, but no functional analysis can be performed due to lack of content.",
