  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency fallback pattern with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the potential misuse of ZIP inclusion, but no actual malicious activity is detected. Malware score remains at 0. The code is safe for use."
