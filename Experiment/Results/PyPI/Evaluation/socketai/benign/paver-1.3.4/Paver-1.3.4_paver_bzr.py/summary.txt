  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Bazaar version control commands with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the enforced Python 2 environment, which is a compatibility restriction, not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
