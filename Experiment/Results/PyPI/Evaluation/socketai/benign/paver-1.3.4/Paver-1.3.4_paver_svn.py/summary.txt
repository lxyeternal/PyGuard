  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with a known security concern: lack of input sanitization leading to potential command injection if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score of approximately 0.4 is justified, and mitigation involves input validation or safer subprocess usage."
