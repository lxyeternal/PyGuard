  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for SVN operations: checkout, update, export, info.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'url', 'dest', 'revision', 'path' used directly in shell command strings.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands executed via sh(), potential for command injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into command strings, then to sh() execution.",
  "anomalies": "No input sanitization or escaping; straightforward command construction; no secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs SVN commands by interpolating user inputs directly into strings without sanitization, creating a command injection risk if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Parsing 'svn info' output is safe. The main concern is the potential for malicious input exploitation. The code is otherwise benign, functioning as a wrapper around SVN CLI. The scores across reports correctly reflect these observations, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4) due to command injection potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with a known security concern: lack of input sanitization leading to potential command injection if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score of approximately 0.4 is justified, and mitigation involves input validation or safer subprocess usage.",
