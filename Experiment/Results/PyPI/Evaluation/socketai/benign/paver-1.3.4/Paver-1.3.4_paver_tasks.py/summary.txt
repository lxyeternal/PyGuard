  "conclusion": "The main security vulnerability is the execution of external 'pavement.py' source code via 'exec(compile(source, ...))' without validation, which can lead to remote code execution if the source is malicious or tampered with. No malicious code or malware is embedded within the provided code itself. The risk is inherent to the pattern of dynamic code execution, not malicious intent. The malware scores should be set to 0, as there is no embedded malicious payload, but the security risk remains high due to the unsafe execution pattern. The pattern should be improved by validating or sandboxing external scripts to mitigate this risk."
