{
  "purpose": "Provides aggregation functions for grouped data using pandas, with support for various statistical and transformation functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, numpy, pandas, and local modules. Reads input data from function parameters such as group_idx, a, and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Uses pandas groupby to process data; no apparent untrusted data sinks or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into pandas DataFrame and groupby operations, then into aggregation functions, which produce the output array.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code present. No suspicious data leaks or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper function that performs groupby operations and aggregation using pandas, supporting multiple functions. It constructs a dictionary of function implementations using functools.partial, including handling NaN-related functions. The aggregate function delegates to an internal _aggregate_base function, which is assumed to handle core aggregation logic. All imported modules and functions appear standard and safe. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code operates entirely within the data processing scope without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of grouped data aggregation leveraging pandas, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe for use as part of a larger data analysis library.",
