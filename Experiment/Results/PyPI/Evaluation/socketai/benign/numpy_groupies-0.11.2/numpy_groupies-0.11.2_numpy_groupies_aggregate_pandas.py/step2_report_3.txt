  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of data aggregation functions leveraging pandas and numpy.\n- It employs standard patterns: pandas groupby, partial functions for various aggregation methods, support for nan-aware variants.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, external network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- Utility functions (`check_dtype`, `allnan`, `anynan`) are imported but their implementations are not shown; assuming they are standard.\n- The code does not contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence & Logic Validity**\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports conclude that the code performs legitimate data processing with no malicious or suspicious elements. This aligns with the code analysis.\n- **Logic flaws:** No logical flaws or errors are evident in the code snippets. The code appears consistent and well-structured.\n\n### **Score Justification & Recommendations**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at 0. No change needed.\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at 0.\n\n#### **Security Risk / Overall Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n- The code is standard data aggregation logic with no external side effects or security concerns.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Issues or Assumptions to Challenge:**\n\n- The reports rely on the assumption that utility functions (`check_dtype`, `allnan`, `anynan`) are safe and standard. If these functions were malicious or flawed, that could introduce risk, but based on the context, this seems unlikely.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or external system interaction, which are common vectors for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n\n- The assigned scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected that would justify higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Remarks:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of data aggregation functions with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.                         |\n| Security Risk   | 0                   | No external interactions, secrets, or vulnerabilities evident.     |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code and reports are aligned, and the current scoring accurately reflects the security posture. No adjustments are necessary.",
