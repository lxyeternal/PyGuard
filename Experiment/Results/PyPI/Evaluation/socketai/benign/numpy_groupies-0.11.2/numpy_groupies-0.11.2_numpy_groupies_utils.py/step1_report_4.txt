  "purpose": "Provide common utility functions and functionality for aggregate implementations in a numpy-based grouping library.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, import statements, get_aliasing, get_func, check_boolean, minimum_dtype, check_dtype, check_fill_value, check_group_idx, _ravel_group_idx, offset_labels, input_validation, unpack, allnan, anynan, nanfirst, nanlast, multi_arange, label_contiguous_1d, relabel_groups_unique, relabel_groups_masked, is_duck_array, iscomplexobj functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted external input; data transformations are all within numpy arrays and function calls, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows involving untrusted input; functions process data internally with no external data flow, mostly array operations and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code consists of utility functions for array validation, type management, and label manipulations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for array and data validation, type management, and group relabeling. It includes functions for alias mapping, dtype determination, validation checks, and group relabeling algorithms. There are no network calls, file I/O, or executable code that could be malicious. The functions seem standard and focused on array processing. No anomalies like obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code relies on numpy and standard Python features, with safe data validation and transformation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of utility functions for array validation, dtype management, and group label manipulations with no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured grouping library, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
