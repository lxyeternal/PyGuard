  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning and metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or malicious outputs present",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, no flow from external untrusted input to critical variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard versioning pattern, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a version tuple based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern for type hints. The version string and tuple are statically assigned with fixed values. There are no inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be boilerplate for package versioning with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security risk.",
