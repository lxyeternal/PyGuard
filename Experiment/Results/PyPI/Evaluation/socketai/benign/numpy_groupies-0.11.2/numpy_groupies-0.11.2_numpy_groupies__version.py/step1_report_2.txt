  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is not intended for functional logic beyond version management.",
  "sources": "Version string assignment and type checking imports",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; purely static version information assignment",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment of version information without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version definition with explicit comments, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables, includes type checking imports conditionally, and assigns static version information. There are no input sources, external data handling, or dangerous code constructs. The presence of comments clarifies the purpose. Overall, it appears to be standard versioning code generated by setuptools_scm, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as version metadata for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
