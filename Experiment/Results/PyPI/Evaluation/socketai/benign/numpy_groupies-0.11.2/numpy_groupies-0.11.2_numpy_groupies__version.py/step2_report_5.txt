  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static version information snippet generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code uses standard patterns, including conditional type hint imports, and assigns fixed version strings and tuples.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are observed.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** perform any runtime operations beyond static variable assignments.\n- It does **not** process user input, perform network calls, or handle sensitive data.\n- The version variables are assigned static, hardcoded values.\n- The conditional import for type hints is standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is boilerplate version info.\n- No flawed reasoning or misinterpretation detected.\n- The assessments correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks)\n\nThese scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is purely static metadata.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not supported by evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a standard, auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, harmless version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
