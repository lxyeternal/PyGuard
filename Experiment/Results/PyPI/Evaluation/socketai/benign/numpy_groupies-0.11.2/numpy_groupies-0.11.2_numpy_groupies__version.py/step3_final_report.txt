  "purpose": "Static version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version string and tuple, conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info snippet with conditional type hint imports. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm, serving purely informational purposes. All signals indicate benign, non-malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version metadata snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
