{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version control and package management.",
  "sources": "The version string and version tuple definitions, as well as conditional type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data inputs that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly from hardcoded values, with no dynamic or untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code contains straightforward variable assignments and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata module created by setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports typing annotations when type checking and assigns fixed version strings and tuples. No external input, user data, or dynamic code execution is involved. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns; the code is purely informational and intended for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version info file generated by a packaging tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply stores static version information.",
