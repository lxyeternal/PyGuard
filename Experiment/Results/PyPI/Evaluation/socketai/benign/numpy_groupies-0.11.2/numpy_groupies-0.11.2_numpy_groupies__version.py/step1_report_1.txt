{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime operations beyond assigning version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, importing typing for type hints if TYPE_CHECKING is True.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard version definition code, no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for TYPE_CHECKING to conditionally import typing and define a version tuple. It assigns static version strings and tuples, which are typical for version management. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling present. The code is straightforward and generated automatically by setuptools_scm, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static metadata definition, with no external data handling or suspicious logic.",
