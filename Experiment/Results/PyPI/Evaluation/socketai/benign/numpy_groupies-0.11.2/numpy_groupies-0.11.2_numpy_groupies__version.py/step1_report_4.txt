{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, primarily used for version control and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version), type checking conditional import, and tuple definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly from static literals, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard pattern for version management; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The 'TYPE_CHECKING' import is typical for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version information variables and a conditional import for type checking. The version data is statically assigned and does not involve external inputs or risky behaviors. The structure aligns with common practices for managing package version info. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks.",
