  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and standard for pytest test filtering. The main security concern is executing untrusted 'func' functions supplied via markers, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if 'func' is malicious. No malware or obfuscation is present. The malware score remains 0. The security risk score should be set around 0.6 to account for the potential danger of executing untrusted code, especially in environments where marker 'func' could be manipulated maliciously."
