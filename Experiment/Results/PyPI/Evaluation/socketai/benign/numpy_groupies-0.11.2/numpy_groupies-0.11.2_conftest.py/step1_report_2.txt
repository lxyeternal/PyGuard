{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest to silently discard test items with invalid parameter combinations based on custom marker logic.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from test item markers and test parameters during collection phase.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily manipulates test items; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Markers are read from test items to decide whether to deselect tests; no external data flow or output manipulation beyond test item management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard pytest configuration and collection modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest hooks for configuration and collection modification. It uses markers to conditionally deselect tests based on a provided function. No external input, no malicious code, no suspicious data handling or network activity. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard pytest plugin development practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest configuration script for filtering tests and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and safe.",
