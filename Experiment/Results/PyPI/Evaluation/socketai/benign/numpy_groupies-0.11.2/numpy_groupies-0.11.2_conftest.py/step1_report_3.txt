{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest to silently discard test items with specific parameter conditions",
  "sources": "The code reads input from test items and their markers; the function parameters provided via markers",
  "sinks": "The code removes certain test items based on marker conditions, affecting test execution flow",
  "flows": "Markers with 'deselect_if' trigger evaluation; if conditions are met, items are removed from the test collection",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present; no external network activity or data leakage observed",
  "analysis": "The code adds a custom marker 'deselect_if' to pytest configuration, then modifies test collection by evaluating a function specified in the marker against each test's parameters. Tests that satisfy the function condition are deselected. The logic is straightforward and primarily controls test filtering based on parameters. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not handle untrusted input directly, nor does it perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script used for test filtering. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply modifies test collection based on user-defined conditions.",
