  "purpose": "Utility functions for grouped data aggregation using numpy, supporting operations like sum, min, max, product, all, any, and handling nan values.",
  "sources": "In-memory data arrays, group indices, and optional fill values; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Results stored in numpy arrays; no external data transmission or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays and group indices through aggregation functions to output arrays; no untrusted external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Uses standard numpy in-place operations and controlled dynamic function retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard grouped aggregation functions with proper initialization and data type handling. It employs numpy's in-place operations and a dynamic function selector via get_func, which is typical for such utility modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The functions are designed for in-memory data processing, suitable for testing or benchmarking. The security risk is minimal, and the code structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for grouped data aggregation with numpy. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
