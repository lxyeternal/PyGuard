  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured statistical utility module with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is its dependency on get_func, which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the dependency concern. Overall, the code is safe for use."
