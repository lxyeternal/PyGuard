  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as statistical utilities and an 'aggregate' function, with input from parameters and utils.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or I/O; data flows internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only concern is reliance on `get_func` which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.2), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.8. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the score aligns with the low risk and no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard aggregation functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; data processed internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk is 0, malware 0, confidence 1, which seems justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, consistent scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard statistical functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Focuses on safe data processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk 0, malware 0, high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with mention of potential reliance on `get_func`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights the dependency on `get_func` which could be risky if malicious, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk 0.2, malware 0, confidence 0.9. Slightly higher risk due to external function dependency, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning appropriately accounts for the external dependency; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; reliance on `get_func` is noted but not deemed malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk 0.2, malware 0, confidence 0.9. Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured statistical utility module.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Use of `get_func`:** The only potential concern, as it introduces external code execution risk if `get_func` is compromised, but this is acknowledged and not evidenced here.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting the minor dependency concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed).\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 seems appropriate, considering the dependency on an external utility function (`get_func`), which could be a vector if malicious.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is a benign utility with minimal external dependency risk, which is adequately reflected in the scores.",
