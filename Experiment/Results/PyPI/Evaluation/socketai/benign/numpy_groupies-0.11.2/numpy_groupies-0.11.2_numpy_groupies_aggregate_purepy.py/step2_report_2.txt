  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a statistical utility module with an 'aggregate' function, relying on parameters and internal utils, notably 'get_func'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O; data flows internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; 'get_func' could be a concern if malicious, but not evident here.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, with confidence 0.8. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign, with the main concern being the external 'get_func' utility. Without its implementation, risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar aggregation utility, emphasizing standard operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; data processed internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; straightforward implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1), no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Very unlikely to be malicious; standard code with no suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focused on data aggregation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal processing only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious intent; standard statistical functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1), no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with note on 'get_func'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O; data flows internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Potential concern about 'get_func', but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; reliance on external 'get_func' is a minor point.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; validation is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a standard, well-structured statistical utility module with grouping and aggregation functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors across reports.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the external 'get_func' utility, which could be malicious if compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Data Leakage or External Communication:** None observed.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Consistent, standard implementation with proper validation.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slight concern over reliance on external 'get_func', but overall very low risk.\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical data aggregation utility, with no signs of malicious intent. The main point of attention is the implementation of 'get_func' in the utils module, which should be reviewed separately to ensure it doesn't introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed analysis.",
