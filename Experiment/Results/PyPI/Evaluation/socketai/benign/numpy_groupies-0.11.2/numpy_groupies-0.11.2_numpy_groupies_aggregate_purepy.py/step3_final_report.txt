{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical aggregation functions and utilities for grouping data, including functions like sum, min, max, mean, variance, standard deviation, and sorting.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as group_idx, a, and optional kwargs; internal utility functions like get_func and aggregate_common_doc.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or I/O; data processed internally within the functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into aggregation functions, with potential reliance on get_func to determine the specific operation; data is grouped and processed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected; reliance on external get_func could be a vector if compromised, but no evidence here.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical and grouping utilities with validation of inputs. It uses get_func to dynamically select functions, which could be a concern if malicious, but no malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with validation checks for group indices and input types. The potential risk lies in the external get_func, but in this context, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured statistical utility module with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is its dependency on get_func, which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the dependency concern. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
