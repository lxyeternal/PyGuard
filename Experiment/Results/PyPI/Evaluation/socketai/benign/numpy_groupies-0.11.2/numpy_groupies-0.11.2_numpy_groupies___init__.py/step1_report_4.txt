{
  "purpose": "This code provides various aggregation functions with fallbacks depending on the availability of dependencies (numpy, numba). It dynamically imports modules and assigns functions accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads package imports (numpy, numba, setuptools_scm, internal modules). Reads version information from internal modules or external package.",
  "sinks": "Calls to aggregate functions, potential version information exposure via __version__",
  "flows": "Imports dependencies -> assigns fallback functions -> calls aggregate functions -> retrieves version info",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports with fallback to dummy functions, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, no malicious network activity. Usage of __version__ is standard. No suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing an aggregation function and defines a dummy function for missing implementations. It conditionally imports numpy and numba, assigning fallback functions if unavailable, which is standard. It conditionally imports version info, handling missing modules gracefully. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets are detected. Overall, it appears to be a typical dependency management and version handling module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module manages aggregation functions and version info with standard conditional imports and fallbacks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code is benign and intended for use in a larger package. Overall security risk is very low.",
