{
  "purpose": "This code manages optional dependencies (numpy, numba) with fallback functions and retrieves version information, facilitating flexible aggregation functionality in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for aggregate modules, optional dependency imports (numpy, numba), version retrieval from local or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Conditional imports lead to assignment of fallback functions; version info retrieval flows from local or external sources; aggregation functions are assigned based on dependency availability.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; fallback functions are standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard dependency management techniques, with try-except blocks for optional modules, assigning dummy functions when dependencies are missing. Version info is retrieved via typical methods. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The fallback functions are safe, and the import logic is straightforward. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for optional dependency handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency management module with fallback mechanisms and version retrieval, exhibiting no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment confirms its benign nature.",
