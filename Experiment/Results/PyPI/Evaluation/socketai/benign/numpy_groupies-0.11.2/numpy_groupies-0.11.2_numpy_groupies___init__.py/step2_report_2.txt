  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily about dependency management, conditional imports, fallback functions, and version info retrieval.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code behaviors are present.\n- The functions and import mechanisms are standard for a Python package that supports optional dependencies.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes dependency management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data sinks; flow is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard fallback mechanisms.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 (low, considering dependency management), confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of dynamic imports and fallback functions is common; no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Conditional imports and fallback functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of try-except for optional dependencies is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard dependency management with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** The current scores (0.1-0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal dependency management complexity but no security threats.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since dependency management can sometimes hide issues, but none are evident here)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the assessment aligns well with the code's nature.",
