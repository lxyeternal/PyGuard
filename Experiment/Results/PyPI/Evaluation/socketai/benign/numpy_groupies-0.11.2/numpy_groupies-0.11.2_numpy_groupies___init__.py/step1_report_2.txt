{
  "purpose": "The code appears to facilitate data aggregation operations, providing fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies and managing different implementations based on available libraries such as numpy and numba.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.aggregate_purepy, .aggregate_numpy, .aggregate_numpy_ufunc, .aggregate_numba, .utils, ._version), and optional external libraries (numpy, numba, setuptools_scm).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or malicious data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional assignments based on availability of numpy and numba, with fallback functions; version extraction flow with optional external package.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically assigns functions based on import success, which is standard but can sometimes obscure control flow. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports for numpy and numba, assigning fallback dummy functions when dependencies are missing. It manages multiple implementations for aggregation functions and version retrieval, with no malicious logic. No external data sources or network communications are present. The use of dynamic imports and fallback functions is common in library code to support optional dependencies. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical modular, dependency-aware Python library setup with no signs of malicious intent. It handles optional dependencies gracefully and exposes aggregation functionalities accordingly. No malicious or security-threatening code was identified.",
