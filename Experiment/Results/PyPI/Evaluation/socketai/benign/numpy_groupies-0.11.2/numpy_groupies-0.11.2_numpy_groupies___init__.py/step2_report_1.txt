  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages optional dependencies (numpy, numba) and version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling or external data sinks are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code employs standard fallback mechanisms, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent; the code appears benign with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly above zero, but justified as the code handles optional dependencies and could, in theory, be misused if dependencies are maliciously replaced. Still, overall, very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency management and fallback functions.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious code is identified.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly higher but still very low, justified by the reliance on optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the same aspects: dependency imports, fallback functions, and version info.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's structure.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Reiterates dependency management, version retrieval, and safe fallback mechanisms.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The confidence level remains high.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, confirming the absence of malicious activity.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is standard dependency management with fallback functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in all reports, justified by the fact that optional dependencies are dynamically imported, which could, in a malicious environment, be exploited. But in this context, the code is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, justified by dependency handling; minimal attack surface.\n\nThis code appears to be a typical, well-structured dependency management module with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
