{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and conditional imports for data aggregation, handling different dependencies like numpy and numba, and managing version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.aggregate_purepy, .aggregate_numpy, .aggregate_numpy_ufunc, .utils, .aggregate_numba, ._version) and standard libraries (numpy, numba, setuptools_scm).",
  "sinks": "Function calls to aggregate, unpack, label_contiguous_1d, multi_arange, relabel_groups_masked, relabel_groups_unique, step_count, step_indices; potential for indirect execution of imported functions.",
  "flows": "Code imports modules; if dependencies are present, functions like aggregate are overridden; uaggregate calls aggregate and unpack; version info is retrieved and assigned.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports handle missing modules gracefully; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of try-except for imports is standard but warrants caution if modules are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules based on availability, replacing placeholder functions with dummy implementations when dependencies are missing. The core function uaggregate wraps aggregate with unpack. Version management uses either local or external tools. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic is present. Conditional imports are handled properly, and no code executes untrusted data or external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency management and utility module for data aggregation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of try-except blocks for imports is typical and not inherently malicious. No backdoors, data leaks, or harmful actions are evident.",
