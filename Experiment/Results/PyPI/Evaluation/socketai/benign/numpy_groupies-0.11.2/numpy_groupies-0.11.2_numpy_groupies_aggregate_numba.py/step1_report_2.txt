  "purpose": "The code provides a set of aggregation operations implemented with JIT compilation for efficient data processing, intended for use in data analysis tasks involving grouped data.",
  "sources": "Input data: group_idx, a, size, fill_value, order, dtype, axis, and kwargs; external functions imported from .utils (aggregate_common_doc, aliasing, check_dtype, check_fill_value, funcs_no_separate_nan, get_func, input_validation).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct output of untrusted data, network communication, or file operations. The code manipulates arrays and performs calculations but does not write to external systems or leak data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (group_idx, a, etc.) into input_validation; then through various internal functions (callable, _inner, _2pass_inner, etc.), with data being processed and stored in arrays (ret, counter, mean, outer). No external data transmission or system commands are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of third-party libraries (numba, numpy) is standard. No obfuscated code, unusual function names, or dynamic code execution are observed. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard aggregation functions optimized with JIT compilation. It includes functions for sum, product, length, logical all/any, min/max, argmax/argmin, variance, standard deviation, cumulative sums/products, and nan-aware variants. Input validation and dtype checking are performed appropriately. No network calls, file operations, or system commands are present. The functions do not handle untrusted external data beyond array manipulations and do not leak data externally. The code structure is typical for high-performance numerical computation, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a legitimate and well-structured implementation of grouped aggregation operations using numba for performance. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
