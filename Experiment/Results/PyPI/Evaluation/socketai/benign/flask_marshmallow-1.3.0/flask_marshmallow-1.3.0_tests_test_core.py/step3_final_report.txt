  "flows": "Mock data -> dump/jsonify functions -> Response objects -> get_data/JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of controlled unit tests for Flask and Marshmallow schemas, utilizing mock data and URL generation. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor security risk scores could be lowered to zero, as no vulnerabilities are demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments are accurate; minor risk scores can be adjusted to zero for clarity.",
