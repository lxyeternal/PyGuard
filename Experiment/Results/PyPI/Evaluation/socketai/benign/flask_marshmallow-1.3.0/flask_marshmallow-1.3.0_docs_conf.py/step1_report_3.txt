  "purpose": "Configuration script for a Sphinx documentation project for Flask-Marshmallow, setting up themes, extensions, and project info.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call, sys.path modification, static list definitions, configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "importlib.metadata.version() retrieves version info; no direct data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version() -> setting version variable; no other flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata to dynamically get package version is standard; appending to sys.path is typical for local theme inclusion; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard Sphinx configuration tasks. It imports version info dynamically using importlib.metadata, which is safe. It appends a directory to sys.path for custom themes, a common practice. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or executable code execution are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. All data sources are static or controlled, with no external input involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for documentation setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
