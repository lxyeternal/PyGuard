  "purpose": "Configure documentation build settings for the Flask-Marshmallow project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata, os, sys modules; append to sys.path; import version info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no data leaks or untrusted data effects apparent.",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version() retrieves version info; sys.path modification for module resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Use of importlib.metadata for version retrieval is standard. Path modification and static configurations are typical for documentation setups.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up Sphinx documentation configurations, including themes, extensions, paths, and project metadata. The use of importlib.metadata to get the package version is normal. Appending to sys.path for theme directory inclusion is common in Sphinx configs. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution, is present. No obfuscated code or anomalies are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely sets up project metadata, paths, themes, and extensions for building project documentation.",
