  "purpose": "Configure documentation build settings for the Flask-Marshmallow project, including theme, extensions, and metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"flask-marshmallow\"), os, sys, sys.path, string literals, dictionary definitions, list literals",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or output, no network or file operations involving untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. It appends a theme directory to sys.path, defines extensions, mappings, project metadata, and styling options. It imports package version info using importlib.metadata, which is a standard way to retrieve package versioning and does not pose security risks. No user input handling, network communication, or sensitive data processing occurs. The code is straightforward, static configuration without any dynamic or suspicious code blocks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply sets up project metadata and appearance, and references local themes and static assets.",
