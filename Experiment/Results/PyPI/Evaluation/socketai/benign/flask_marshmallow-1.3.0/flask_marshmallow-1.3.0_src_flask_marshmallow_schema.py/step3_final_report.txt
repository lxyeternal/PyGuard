  "purpose": "Defines a custom marshmallow.Schema subclass with a jsonify method for Flask responses.",
  "sources": "self.dump() method for serialization, flask.jsonify() for response output.",
  "sinks": "flask.jsonify() outputs serialized data as HTTP response.",
  "flows": "Data serialized via dump() then passed to flask.jsonify() for response.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of marshmallow.Schema with a custom jsonify method. It uses standard libraries and functions without any external data sources, secrets, or dynamic code execution. No network activity or malicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign utility for serializing data in Flask applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The small security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are justified given the code's simplicity, but could be slightly lowered to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
