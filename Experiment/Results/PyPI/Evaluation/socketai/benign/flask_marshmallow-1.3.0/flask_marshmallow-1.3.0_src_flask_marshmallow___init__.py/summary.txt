  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask extension for marshmallow integration, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
