{
  "purpose": "Provides validation classes for uploaded file size and type in Flask/Marshmallow applications.",
  "sources": "Reads from FileStorage.stream for size; uses filename for extension; os.stat for file size.",
  "sinks": "Raises ValidationError on invalid size or type; no external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input FileStorage -> size/type validation -> ValidationError if invalid -> success if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard regex and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file validation routines: calculating size via stream or os.stat, parsing size units with regex, and checking filename extensions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic present. Extension spoofing is a known limitation but not malicious. The code is straightforward, using common libraries and practices, with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of file size and type validation for web uploads. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It relies on common validation techniques with minimal security risks, primarily the known limitation of extension-based validation.",
