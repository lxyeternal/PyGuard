{
  "purpose": "This module provides custom validation classes for handling file uploads, specifically validating file size and file type in a web application using Flask and Marshmallow.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from FileStorage objects, particularly their stream and filename properties.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions raise exceptions upon invalid input, but do not write or transmit data. No external sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data from FileStorage objects is validated through size and extension checks, with no complex data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded values are present. The code performs standard file validation without obfuscation or hidden behavior. No unusual code patterns or dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validators: FileSize and FileType, both operating on FileStorage objects. FileSize calculates size via file streams, using safe methods like getbuffer() and os.stat(). FileType checks filename extensions against a whitelist. The parsing of size strings is done with a regex and standard conversion. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or system modifications. Error handling is limited to raising ValidationError with formatted messages. Overall, the code performs straightforward validation without suspicious side effects or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate validation code for file uploads, focusing on file size and type. No malicious intent or malicious code segments are evident. The design is consistent with standard practices for secure file validation in web applications.",
