  "purpose": "Provides custom validation classes for file size and file type in Flask-Marshmallow schemas.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FileStorage objects, including file streams and filenames.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes file stream data via size calculations, but primarily performs validation checks.",
  "flows": "Reads file stream or filename → validates size or extension → raises ValidationError if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validator classes: FileSize and FileType. FileSize calculates file size from streams or temporary files, parsing human-readable size strings into bytes. FileType checks file extensions against allowed types. Both validators perform standard validation routines without executing untrusted code or making network requests. No hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors are present. The only potential concern could be reliance on filename extension for validation, which is common but can be spoofed; however, this is standard practice rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate validation logic for uploaded files, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs size and type validation securely without executing or leaking data. Overall, it poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
