{
  "purpose": "Provides validation classes for file size and file type within Flask applications using marshmallow.",
  "sources": "Reads from FileStorage objects, specifically the 'stream' attribute and 'filename' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Uses validation functions that could raise ValidationError with custom messages, but does not execute untrusted code or perform unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "Validations check the size and extension of uploaded files; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The functions are standard validation routines with no hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validation classes for file size and type, utilizing safe standard library functions and regex parsing for size units. The '_get_filestorage_size' function reads from FileStorage streams, but it does so securely by resetting the stream position after reading. The validation classes raise ValidationError with customizable messages, but do not perform any unsafe operations or external calls. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent is detected. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard practices for validation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of file validation for size and type, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for use in a production environment.",
