{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom validators for file size and file type, intended for use with Flask-Marshmallow to validate uploaded files in web applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from FileStorage objects, specifically from the stream attribute and filename property.",
  "sinks": "The code performs file size calculations using os.stat() and file.read(), and raises ValidationError messages. No external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input (FileStorage) -> _get_filestorage_size / filename extension check -> ValidationError (if invalid) -> Successful return of the validated FileStorage object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present. Functions and classes perform expected validation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes for validating file size and type for uploaded files, using safe operations such as reading file streams and checking extensions. The _parse_size function converts size strings into byte values safely using regex and float conversion. Validation classes raise ValidationError with formatted messages when constraints are not met. No external network access, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. Usage of standard libraries and safe practices suggests this code is benign and intended solely for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of file validation for web applications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation using safe methods and does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments.",
