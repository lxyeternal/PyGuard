  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides safe, standard validators for file size and type. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code performs expected validation tasks with no signs of malicious activity. The functions use safe practices, such as resetting stream pointers after reading, and rely on standard libraries.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard validation logic with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard validation code, with high confidence and no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified), confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to potential spoofing via filename extension, which is a known limitation of extension-based validation, not maliciousness. The malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Validates file size and type; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified; reliance on filename extension can be spoofed, but this is a common and accepted practice, not malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; standard validation routines, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are legitimate, standard validators for file size and type, used in web app validation.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports correctly identify no malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to reliance on filename extension for file type validation, which is a known limitation but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minor risk due to extension spoofing, but this is standard practice, not malicious.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is benign, performing standard validation routines with safe practices. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment confirms this code is safe and intended solely for legitimate file validation purposes.",
