{
  "purpose": "Provides validation classes for file size and file type, intended for use with Flask and Marshmallow schemas to validate uploaded files.",
  "sources": "Reads from file.stream, file.read(), and file.filename; uses environment via os.stat and os.path.splitext; reads input parameters for size parsing and extension validation.",
  "sinks": "os.stat for file size, os.path.splitext for extension extraction, and regex for parsing size units; no direct sinks that send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input FileStorage object -> _get_filestorage_size or extension extraction -> validation logic -> raises ValidationError if invalid",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of regex for parsing sizes is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution present. Error messages are straightforward. No network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validators for file size and type, relying on standard Python libraries and common patterns for input validation. The functions use well-understood mechanisms like os.stat, regex parsing, and file extension checking. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be intended solely for input validation in web applications. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of file validation classes for Flask/Marshmallow, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs legitimate validation functions with no external or covert malicious activity.",
