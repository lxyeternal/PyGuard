{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style, used in syntax highlighting within applications like code editors or documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class attributes defining style properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or perform data leaks; no network operations, file writes, or external calls.",
  "flows": "The code sets style properties directly and does not process untrusted data or user input; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments. The code is straightforward style definitions with static strings and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports style tokens and defines a subclass of Style with static color and style attributes for syntax highlighting. There are no dynamic executions, input/output operations, or data processing that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code solely specifies static style mappings, which is typical for styling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign style configuration for Pygments. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and is purely declarative styling code.",
