  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, based on the Tango style, for use in Flask-related projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pygments.style and pygments.token; class attribute definitions within FlaskyStyle.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no handling of untrusted input or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a style class with static attributes and no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The style definitions are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling components from the Pygments library and defines a Style subclass with static style mappings for syntax token types. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code solely sets color and style attributes for syntax highlighting purposes. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The overall structure is clear and standard for style definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static style definition for syntax highlighting. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this module.",
