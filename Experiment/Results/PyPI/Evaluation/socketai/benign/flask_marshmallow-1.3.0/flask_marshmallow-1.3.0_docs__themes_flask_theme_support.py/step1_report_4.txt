  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, based on the Tango style, intended for use with Flask applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token; class definition setting style attributes and token styles.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely defines style configurations without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a syntax highlighting style. It imports necessary modules, defines style attributes, and assigns color styles to various token types. There are no dynamic executions, data inputs, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving solely as a style configuration for syntax highlighting. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
