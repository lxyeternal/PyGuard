  "purpose": "Static style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighting, defining color and style mappings for various token types.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; static class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static style definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling modules and defines a class with static style attributes for syntax tokens. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or execution. The style definitions are clear, static, and serve aesthetic purposes only. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely declarative, with no external interactions or executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for Pygments with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its static, non-malicious nature and assign appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
