{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules, class definition for FlaskyStyle.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external inputs, or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static style configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious functions or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling components from the pygments library and defines a subclass FlaskyStyle that specifies color and style attributes for syntax highlighting tokens. All properties are statically defined; no runtime code execution, data manipulation, or external interactions are present. The style configuration appears straightforward and typical for a Pygments style class, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign style definition for syntax highlighting with no malicious or security concerns. It is static, uses standard library components, and does not perform any suspicious activities.",
