{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style, likely used for code display or IDE customization.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pygments.style' and 'pygments.token', and the class definition with style attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sink points or untrusted data handling observed in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes style mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward style configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Pygments, defines a class 'FlaskyStyle' inheriting from Style, and assigns various style rules to token types for syntax highlighting. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic. The purpose appears purely stylistic and static.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign style definition for Pygments syntax highlighting. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no signs of obfuscation or malware. It simply sets aesthetic styles for syntax tokens.",
