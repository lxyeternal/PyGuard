  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe use of pickle for serialization/deserialization without validation, posing a high risk of remote code execution if malicious pickle data is introduced. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk scores in the reports are appropriate, with a recommended overall risk score around 0.9. To mitigate this vulnerability, replace pickle with safer serialization formats like JSON and implement validation measures."
