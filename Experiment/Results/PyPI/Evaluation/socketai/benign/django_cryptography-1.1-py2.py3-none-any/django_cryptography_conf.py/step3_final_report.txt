  "purpose": "Configuration class for cryptographic key derivation using PBKDF2 with SHA256, static salt, and optional key input.",
  "sources": "Reads SALT, KEY, SECRET_KEY, and configuration data from class attributes and Django settings.",
  "sinks": "Derives cryptographic key via pbkdf2.PBKDF2HMAC and stores in configured_data['KEY'].",
  "flows": "Input parameters (SALT, KEY, SECRET_KEY) flow into PBKDF2HMAC derivation process, resulting in derived key stored in configured_data['KEY'].",
  "anomalies": "Uses a static, hardcoded salt ('django-cryptography'), which reduces cryptographic security but is not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic key derivation with PBKDF2, relying on a static salt which is a known security weakness but not malicious. No malicious activity, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The use of SECRET_KEY as input is typical but depends on SECRET_KEY's security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature, with the main concern being the static salt's security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic configuration utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The static salt reduces cryptographic strength but does not constitute malicious activity. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
