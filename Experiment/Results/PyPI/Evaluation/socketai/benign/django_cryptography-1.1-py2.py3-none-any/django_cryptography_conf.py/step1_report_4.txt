  "sources": "self.configured_data['KEY'], settings.SECRET_KEY, self.configured_data['SALT']",
  "sinks": "self.configured_data['KEY'] after derivation",
  "flows": "KEY and SECRET_KEY flow into PBKDF2HMAC for key derivation; salt and digest influence the process",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded SALT value 'django-cryptography' which may reduce salt uniqueness; no explicit input validation or secure storage of derived key",
  "analysis": "The code sets up cryptographic parameters using the cryptography library. It derives a key via PBKDF2HMAC with a fixed salt value and a configurable secret key (either provided or from Django settings). The salt 'django-cryptography' is hardcoded, which is not ideal for cryptographic best practices but not malicious by itself. The key derivation process appears standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code’s primary function is cryptographic key derivation, which is a normal security operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic setup with key derivation using PBKDF2. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are present. The use of a fixed salt is not best practice but not malicious. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate security utility.",
