  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by proper implementation and use of cryptography, with reliance on external configuration being a common practice but a minor potential misconfiguration point."
