{
  "purpose": "Provides cryptographic utilities including HMAC, PBKDF2, AES encryption/decryption, and a modified Fernet implementation for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as key_salt, value, secret, password, salt, data, token, and external settings (CryptographyConf) for keys and digest algorithms.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions processing data; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into cryptographic primitives (hashing, key derivation, encryption), with signing and verification steps; no suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom for IVs, reliance on external configuration for keys, and flexible Fernet key handling are standard practices; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs cryptography library functions correctly, with proper IV handling, padding, and signing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The Fernet implementation is a variation but appears intentional and benign. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by proper implementation and use of cryptography, with reliance on external configuration being a common practice but a minor potential misconfiguration point.",
