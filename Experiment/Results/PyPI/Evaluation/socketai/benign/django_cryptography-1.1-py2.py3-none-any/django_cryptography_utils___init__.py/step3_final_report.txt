  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or summaries.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, files, network connections, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, data output streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file output, potentially via code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious indicators detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or suspicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern given limited code or summaries. Confidence levels are appropriate, higher where more code is available. No obfuscation detected. Minor adjustments could include lowering risk scores to zero where code is fully benign, but current scores are reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the available data. No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists, and the low security risk scores are appropriate. Slightly lowering risk scores to zero in fully benign cases could improve precision, but current assessments are acceptable.",
