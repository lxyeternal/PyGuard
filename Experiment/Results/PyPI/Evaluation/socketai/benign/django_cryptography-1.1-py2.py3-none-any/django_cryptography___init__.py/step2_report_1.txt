  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `get_version` from `django.utils.version`.\n- Defines a static version tuple `VERSION`.\n- Calls `get_version(VERSION)` to generate a version string stored in `__version__`.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is straightforward, using Django's official utility.\n- No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard versioning pattern.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, notes the straightforward nature.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=0.9 and securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Concern:** The securityRisk=0.1 seems to imply a minor concern, but the code doesn't present any real risk.\n- **Verdict:** The small risk score is probably unwarranted; the code is benign.\n- **Suggestion:** Reduce securityRisk to 0 or 0.05 for consistency.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward version retrieval.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard version info code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros except confidence=1, but securityRisk=0.25.\n- **Concern:** The securityRisk score is higher here without any justification. The code is harmless.\n- **Suggestion:** Lower securityRisk to 0 or 0.05.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports correctly have malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, static version string generation using Django's utility.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malware.\n- The minor securityRisk scores assigned in some reports are overestimations given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are largely accurate in their assessments, but the small securityRisk scores in reports 2 and 5 should be lowered to reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard version reporting snippet with no security concerns. The scores should reflect that, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
