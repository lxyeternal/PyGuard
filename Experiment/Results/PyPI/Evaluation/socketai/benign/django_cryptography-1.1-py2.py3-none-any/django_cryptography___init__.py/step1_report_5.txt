  "sources": "Importing get_version from django.utils.version; calling get_version with VERSION tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "VERSION tuple is passed directly to get_version; the function likely generates a version string based on this tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only involves standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Django utility function for version handling and defines a version tuple. It then uses get_version to generate a version string. No untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be for informational purposes only, with no side effects or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
