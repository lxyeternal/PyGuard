  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it imports `get_version`, defines `VERSION`, and assigns `__version__`.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** No flaws; it's a straightforward version string generation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; code matches description.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** No suspicious behavior; uses official Django utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — the risk score might be slightly high given the benign code.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely for versioning, a risk score of 0.1 seems slightly elevated but perhaps acceptable if considering the potential for misinterpretation.\n- **Recommendation:** Possibly reduce risk to 0, but not critical.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; static version tuple, standard utility.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** No anomalies; standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** No anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.25 — slightly higher, perhaps due to the mention of potential risk.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is benign, a risk score of 0.25 may be overstated. It might be better to set it to 0 unless there's a reason to suspect otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are mostly 0, with some at 0.1 or 0.25, which may be slightly high given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code itself is a standard versioning snippet, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores should reflect that: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports are unjustified; they should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical version string generator using Django's internal utilities, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
