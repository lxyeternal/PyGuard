  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version of the Django utility package.",
  "sources": "The function call to django.utils.version.get_version with the VERSION tuple as input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The VERSION tuple is passed to get_version, which generates a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard Django utility functions and a static version tuple.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a versioning utility from Django, defines a static version tuple, and calls get_version to generate a version string. The version tuple is hardcoded and static. The get_version function is part of Django's internal utilities, used for consistent version reporting. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version reporting snippet from Django with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard version string generation without external inputs or sensitive operations.",
