  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code imports `get_version` from `django.utils.version`, defines a static `VERSION` tuple, and assigns the output of `get_version(VERSION)` to `__version__`. The code is straightforward, using standard Django utilities, with no obfuscation or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's function.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; relies on Django's official utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) perhaps due to cautiousness about external utility behavior, but no real concern. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard version reporting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the process is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.25, confidence=1.\n\n**Key Point:** The securityRisk score is set to 0.25, which is relatively high given the code's simplicity. The report claims the code is standard, with no external input or data leaks.\n\n**Justification:** Since the code only calls a utility function with a static tuple, there's no real security risk. The elevated score may be overly cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Most are 0 or very low, except report 5's 0.25, which seems unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code's simplicity and reliance on Django's internal utilities, a risk score higher than 0.1 isn't justified. I would set all to **0**.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward version string generator, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is safe and standard. The only adjustment I recommend is lowering the security risk score in report 5 from 0.25 to 0, aligning with the actual minimal risk posed by this code snippet.",
