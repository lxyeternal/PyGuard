{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version of the Django package.",
  "sources": "The get_version function from django.utils.version, and the VERSION tuple.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The VERSION tuple is passed to get_version to generate __version__, which is then stored.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a versioning utility from Django, defines a version tuple, and uses get_version to produce a string version. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The only potential concern might be if get_version behaves unexpectedly, but it is an official Django utility intended to generate version strings from version info, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines and retrieves the Django version string; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
