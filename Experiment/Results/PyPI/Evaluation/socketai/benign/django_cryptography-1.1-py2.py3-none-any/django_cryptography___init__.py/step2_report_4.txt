  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scores:\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple import and function call to generate a version string.\n- All reports agree that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The get_version function is an official Django utility, used here in a straightforward manner.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The version tuple is hardcoded and static.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, standard versioning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also straightforward, with a minor concern about get_version's behavior, but it's an official utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard version handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.25). While the code remains straightforward, the report notes no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Potential concern:** The elevated score might be due to the mention of \"potential\" in the purpose, but since the code is static and uses official utilities, this seems unwarranted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.25 — possibly slightly overestimated but acceptable given the cautious approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version string generator.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are zero, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code does not involve any risky operations. The highest is 0.25, which is acceptable for a cautious estimate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and the use of official Django utilities, I would assign a **risk score of 0** for this code.\n\n**Note:** The slight elevation in report 5's securityRisk score appears to be an overestimation; I would recommend lowering it to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are generally appropriate, with the exception of report 5's securityRisk, which should be 0.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**In conclusion, I would set:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward, standard nature.",
