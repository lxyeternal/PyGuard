  "purpose": "Determine the version of the Django package being used",
  "sources": "Import statement for get_version from django.utils.version, usage of get_version(VERSION)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external connections",
  "flows": "The get_version function processes the VERSION tuple to generate a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward version handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports get_version from Django's utility module, defines a VERSION tuple, and calls get_version with this tuple to set __version__. The process appears standard for version management. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is involved. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The code is simple and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines and retrieves a version string for Django, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
