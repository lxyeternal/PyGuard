  "purpose": "Generate a version string for the Django utility based on a predefined version tuple.",
  "sources": "The code reads the VERSION tuple and calls get_version to generate the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "The __version__ variable stores the output, which could potentially be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "VERSION tuple → get_version() function → __version__ assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on a standard Django utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Django utility function, defines a version tuple, and assigns a generated version string to __version__. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The usage appears to be a normal versioning approach in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward versioning implementation using Django utilities, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
