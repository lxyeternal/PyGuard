  "purpose": "Generate a version string for a Django project using the get_version utility.",
  "sources": "Import from django.utils.version and static VERSION tuple.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__; no untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "get_version(VERSION) produces version string assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static versioning code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an official Django utility, defines a static version tuple, and assigns the generated version string to __version__. No dynamic inputs, external data, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple, clear, and standard for version reporting. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The scores in previous reports overestimate minimal risks; given the benign nature, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version string generator using Django's utility. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The appropriate assessment is that all risk and malware scores are zero, with high confidence.",
