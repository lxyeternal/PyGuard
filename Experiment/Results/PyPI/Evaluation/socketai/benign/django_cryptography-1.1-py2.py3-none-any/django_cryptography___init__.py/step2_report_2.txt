  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it imports `get_version`, defines `VERSION`, and assigns `__version__`. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code structure; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning correctly states that `get_version` is an official utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — possibly slightly high for such simple code, but the report assigns a minimal risk, which seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just version retrieval.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code; no anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Straightforward version reporting, no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code; no anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard version retrieval.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code; no anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.25 — slightly higher but still low, given the simplicity.\n- **Analysis:** The report suggests a minimal security risk; this is acceptable given the static nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard versioning snippet.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1 and 0.25) for report 2 and 5, but overall very low, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard Django versioning snippet.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (very low, just the minimal inherent risk of static version info)\n\n**Note:** The minor risk scores assigned in some reports (0.1 or 0.25) are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and carries no security risks. The scores should be uniformly zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (around 0.05).",
