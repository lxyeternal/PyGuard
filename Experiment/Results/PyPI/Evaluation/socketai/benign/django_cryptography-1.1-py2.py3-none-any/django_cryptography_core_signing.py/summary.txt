  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of cryptographic signing and serialization utilities for Django applications. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the security of external secrets, which is typical for such utilities. The obfuscation level is zero, and the malware likelihood is zero. Overall, the code is trustworthy and aligns with best practices."
