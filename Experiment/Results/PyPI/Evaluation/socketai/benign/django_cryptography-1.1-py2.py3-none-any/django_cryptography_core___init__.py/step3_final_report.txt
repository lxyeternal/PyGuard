{
  "purpose": "Assess open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, network connections, file operations, data handling points within the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file write/read operations, environment variable access, data output points, system command executions.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks like network, file system, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, unexplained data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks actual snippets, limiting static analysis. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are evident. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity. The absence of code prevents detection of potential vulnerabilities or malicious logic. The structure and comments do not suggest obfuscation or sabotage. The confidence in benign assessment is high due to lack of suspicious signals, but limited by missing code details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
