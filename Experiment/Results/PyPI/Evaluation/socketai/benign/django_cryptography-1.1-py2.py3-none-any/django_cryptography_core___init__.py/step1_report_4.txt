  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external modules (exact sources are not visible in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or data exports, but explicit sink functions are not clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or source variables through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. There are no signs of obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed as a standard Python script with typical structure. It does not contain suspicious patterns such as malicious data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or connection to suspicious domains. Without specific external context or hidden code, it appears benign. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent within the visible code, though the lack of comments or clear purpose limits confidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious flows, or malware indicators.",
