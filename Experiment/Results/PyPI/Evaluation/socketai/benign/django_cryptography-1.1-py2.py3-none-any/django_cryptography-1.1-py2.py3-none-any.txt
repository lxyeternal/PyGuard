      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe use of pickle for serialization/deserialization without validation, posing a high risk of remote code execution if malicious pickle data is introduced. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk scores in the reports are appropriate, with a recommended overall risk score around 0.9. To mitigate this vulnerability, replace pickle with safer serialization formats like JSON and implement validation measures."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of cryptographic signing and serialization utilities for Django applications. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the security of external secrets, which is typical for such utilities. The obfuscation level is zero, and the malware likelihood is zero. Overall, the code is trustworthy and aligns with best practices."

Slightly lowering risk scores to zero in fully benign cases could improve precision, but current assessments are acceptable."

      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by proper implementation and use of cryptography, with reliance on external configuration being a common practice but a minor potential misconfiguration point."
