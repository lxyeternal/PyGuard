  "purpose": "Build configuration for Sphinx documentation, setting paths, extensions, and project info.",
  "sources": "Path manipulations, import of 'geotext' for version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script. It adjusts sys.path to include the project root, imports 'geotext' solely to access its version, and sets documentation options. There is no user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The import of 'geotext' is standard for version referencing and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The import of 'geotext' is typical and safe, and no suspicious behavior is present.",
