  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx, setting up paths, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Reads project root directory via os.getcwd(), imports the 'geotext' module, and adds project root to sys.path.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "sys.path insertion and import of 'geotext' is straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically inserts paths and imports a module without validation; 'geotext' module import could be scrutinized if malicious, but nothing suspicious is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file, with no user input handling, no network connections, no execution of untrusted code, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The import of 'geotext' is a normal dependency import, and the path modifications are typical for documentation builds. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily sets up paths, extensions, and output options for documentation generation.",
