{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'geotext' module, verifying extraction of cities, nationalities, and countries from text.",
  "sources": "Input text variables within test methods, provided directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing the output of geotext.GeoText to expected results; no external data sinks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> geotext.GeoText(text) -> extraction methods -> assertion checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; standard testing code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing by providing static input strings to the geotext library and verifying the extracted entities against expected results. There is no data collection, network communication, or manipulation of environment variables. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears standard for a test suite, focusing solely on input-output validation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script for verifying the functionality of the geotext module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It merely tests text parsing capabilities using predefined inputs and expected outputs.",
