{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'geotext' module to verify extraction of cities, nationalities, and countries from static text inputs.",
  "sources": "Static string literals within test cases, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs assertions only.",
  "flows": "Input strings fed into geotext.GeoText instances, results compared against expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests using static data, with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It tests the functionality of the geotext library in extracting geographic entities and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the static, controlled inputs and assertions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured unit testing suite for the geotext library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
