  "purpose": "Unit tests for the geotext module to extract geographical and nationality data from text.",
  "sources": "Input text strings provided directly within test cases for geotext.GeoText.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; no data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into geotext.GeoText instances, which process and extract data like cities, nationalities, and countries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing for the geotext module, calling its methods with various text inputs to verify city, nationality, and country extraction. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No external connections, environment variable misuse, or obfuscation present. The module appears to be a standard test suite. All operations are typical for unit testing and involve no risky code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite for the geotext module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
