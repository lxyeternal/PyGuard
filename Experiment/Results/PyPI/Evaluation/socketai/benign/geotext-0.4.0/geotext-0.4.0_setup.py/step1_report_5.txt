{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package called 'geotext', used for extracting country and city mentions from text.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, HISTORY.rst, and package requirements from the file system; reads package data files",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) are used solely for package metadata; no data flows to potentially harmful sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic; the script is a standard setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup functions, reads documentation files, defines package requirements, and calls setup() with metadata. It uses standard practices for packaging, with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. No external network or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
