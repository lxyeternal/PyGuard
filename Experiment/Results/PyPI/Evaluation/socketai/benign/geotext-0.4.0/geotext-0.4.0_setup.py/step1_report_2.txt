{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the geotext Python package, primarily used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; no other data inputs or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling of untrusted input; no external data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "File reading operations for package descriptions; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures, including reading documentation files and configuring package metadata. No external data inputs are processed beyond static file reads. No code injections, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic are present. Usage of 'setuptools' and 'distutils' is standard for Python package configuration. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for the 'geotext' package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. It is a typical package configuration file with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
