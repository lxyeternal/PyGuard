{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'geotext'. It handles package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long descriptions; reads dependencies from variables (though empty); reads package data from the 'geotext/data/' directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or execute external commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads documentation files and configuration variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard packaging practices and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from standard libraries, reads static files for descriptions, and defines package metadata and dependencies. It appears to be a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. All code is typical for Python package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard packaging tasks securely and transparently.",
