{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for the 'geotext' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files to compose the long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no data is processed or output in a manner that could lead to leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to build package metadata; no flow of untrusted input into execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard setup.py patterns with no obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading documentation files, defining requirements, and calling setuptools.setup with package metadata. It handles ImportError gracefully. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
