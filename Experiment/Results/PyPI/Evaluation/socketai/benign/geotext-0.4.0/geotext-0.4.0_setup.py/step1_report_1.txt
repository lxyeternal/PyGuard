{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'geotext', used for extracting country and city mentions from text.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, HISTORY.rst files for long description; imports setup functions; reads package data files.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data being written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly static file reading and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and data inclusion for distribution. It reads documentation files, specifies dependencies, and configures package details. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks are present. The 'requirements' and 'test_requirements' lists are placeholders but do not contain malicious code. The code adheres to typical setup.py conventions without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware or malicious data flows. The overall security risk is negligible.",
