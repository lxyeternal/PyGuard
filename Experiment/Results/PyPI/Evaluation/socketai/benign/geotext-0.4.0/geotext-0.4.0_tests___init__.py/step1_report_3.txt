  "flows": "No data flows, source-to-sink paths, or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the encoding declaration; no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is merely a single line comment specifying the file encoding. It does not contain any executable code, data processing, or logic. Since it lacks functions, data handling, external calls, or any dynamic features, there are no security risks, data leaks, or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple encoding declaration comment with no executable content. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security issues. It appears to be a standard, benign header comment.",
