{
  "purpose": "The code specifies the encoding for the Python source file as UTF-8.",
  "sources": "The source is the line specifying the file encoding, which is a comment indicating the encoding used.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data processing in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs as this is only an encoding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment setting the encoding; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard declaration for UTF-8 encoding at the start of a Python file. It does not read input, process data, or include any executable logic. There are no source-to-sink flows, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports or functions. It is a common practice for Python 2 files to specify encoding, and this line alone does not pose any security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign encoding declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
