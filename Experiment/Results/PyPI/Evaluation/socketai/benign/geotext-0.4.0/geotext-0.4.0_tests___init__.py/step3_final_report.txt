{
  "purpose": "This code declares UTF-8 encoding in a Python script, serving as a file encoding declaration.",
  "sources": "The comment line specifying '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-'",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment declaring UTF-8 encoding, a common and benign practice in Python scripts. No executable code, data processing, or external interactions exist. The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious logic, or anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a standard encoding declaration comment. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
