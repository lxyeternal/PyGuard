{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or a minimal script that specifies UTF-8 encoding but does not contain executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit input sources such as user input, environment variables, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "There are no data outputs, external calls, or potentially unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code contains only a encoding declaration without executable instructions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains only a coding declaration; no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a coding declaration indicating UTF-8 encoding. It does not include any logic, input handling, data processing, or external interactions. As a result, there are no source or sink points, and no data flows to analyze. The code is typical of a minimal file header, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple encoding declaration with no executable logic or malicious content. It poses no security risks.",
