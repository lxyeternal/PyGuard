{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module header setting metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and importing a class 'GeoText' from a local module (.geotext).",
  "sources": "Static attributes (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement (from .geotext import GeoText).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import statement imports 'GeoText' from local module; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with metadata attributes and an import statement. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or malicious constructs. The import is from a local module, typical in package structures. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. Overall, the code is standard, harmless, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module header with a harmless import statement. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
