{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module header with metadata and an import statement for a geotext library, likely for geographical text processing.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and the import statement 'from .geotext import GeoText'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; only metadata and a straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of module metadata and an import statement. It does not include any code that reads input, processes data, or performs actions that could be malicious. The import of a local module 'geotext' suggests intended functionality related to geographical text processing but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module header with an import statement for a geospatial text library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
