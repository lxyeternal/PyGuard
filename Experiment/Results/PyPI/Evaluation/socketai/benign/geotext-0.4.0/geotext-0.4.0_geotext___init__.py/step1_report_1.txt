{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import the GeoText module.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; metadata variables set statically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of author, email, and version metadata; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata attributes (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports a module from a relative package. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The import statement imports a class or module (GeoText) but does not instantiate or invoke any methods. There is no obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module header with metadata and an import statement. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup.",
