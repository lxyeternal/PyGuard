{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module metadata declaration and import statement for the 'geotext' library, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads author information, email, version, and imports the 'GeoText' class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the only action is importing a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The metadata is standard; no obfuscated code, code injection, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains module metadata attributes (__author__, __email__, __version__) which are standard. It imports a class 'GeoText' from a relative module, which is typical for package structure. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or security-sensitive code. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple module declaration with a harmless import statement. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
