{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package/module and imports a class named GeoText from a local module.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement from local module (.geotext import GeoText)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks, network activity, or execution of untrusted code detected",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident; the code is purely declarative and import-based",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The import statement is standard for local module import.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports a class from a local module. No user input, external data, or network operations are present. The import is from a relative module, which is typical for package structure. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module header with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to provide metadata and import functionality for a Python package. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.",
