  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports the GeoText class from a local package",
  "sources": "Module metadata assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement for .geotext",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as there are no input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple metadata definitions and a standard import statement",
  "analysis": "The code only sets module metadata and imports a local class. There are no dynamic or malicious code elements, no data input, and no suspicious network or system interactions. The import is from a relative package, which is typical for package modules. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module header with a harmless import statement. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
