{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code or descriptions for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code itself, input data, environment variables, network interactions, and data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited or indicate malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system commands), indicating potential malicious or insecure behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or code that performs unexpected actions.",
  "analysis": "All five reports describe code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The malware scores are consistently 0, and security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting confidence in benign behavior. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or detailed code descriptions. Minor variations in risk scores are justified but could be standardized for consistency. No anomalies or inconsistencies are identified. The assessments align with the provided descriptions, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores and reasoning across all reports are consistent and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary based on the current information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
