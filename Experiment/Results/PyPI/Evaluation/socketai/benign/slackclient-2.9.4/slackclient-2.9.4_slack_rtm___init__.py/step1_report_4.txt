{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, potentially involving external inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, possibly from environment variables or external files if present, but no explicit input sources are identifiable in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs such as print statements or data writes, but none are clearly present in the code. There are no obvious untrusted data handling points or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through processing functions, but no external untrusted data sources or destinations are explicitly connected in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated or misleading code constructs are detected. No unusual behavior like network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard syntax and no complex or suspicious language features. It does not perform dangerous operations, call external servers, or manipulate system files. The absence of input validation or external interactions reduces the likelihood of malicious activity. The code appears benign and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to serve a normal computational purpose without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
