{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific functionality, which is not explicitly described due to the lack of visible code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to files, network sockets, or displays output; potentially uses eval or exec on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like eval, exec, or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual language features or dynamic execution are not present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation without signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malicious data handling, secret leaks, or malicious network activity. The use of third-party libraries seems typical. Without visible explicit code, there is no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation, but due to lack of detailed code content, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
