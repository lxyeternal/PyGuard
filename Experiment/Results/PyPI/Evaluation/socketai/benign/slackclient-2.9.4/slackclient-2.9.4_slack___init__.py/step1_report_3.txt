  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports and logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from Slack SDK libraries; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No use of untrusted data, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup and imports for Slack SDK components. There are no operations, data processing, or network actions that could be malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The imports are typical for a Slack bot or app integration, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a Slack integration, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is benign and intended for normal operation.",
