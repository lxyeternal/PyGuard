  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. All imports are from official Slack SDK modules with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and Slack SDK modules, setting a default NullHandler for logging to prevent warnings. There is no data processing, user input, or network activity. All imported modules are standard, official Slack SDK components. No code executes or manipulates data in a suspicious way. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for logging and Slack API interactions. It performs no malicious actions or security risks.",
