  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an async Slack webhook client, matching the implementation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Identifies that user input flows into request bodies and headers, which is accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. The code relies on external functions (_build_body, _build_request_headers), but nothing suspicious is indicated.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The assessment of low malware (0) and low security risk (0.2) aligns with the code's nature. The confidence (0.9) seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate, with data flowing into HTTP requests and response parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. External utility functions are a concern but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Low malware (0), low security risk (0.2), consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flows into requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; session management and request handling are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score remains 0, matching the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identified.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or backdoors. Logging practices are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware remains 0, security risk low.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, proper session handling.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk low (0.1), matching the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code is a standard webhook client, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2) is reasonable given the potential for untrusted input in request bodies and headers, but overall low.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for network code handling untrusted input)\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free from malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed. The supply chain risk here is minimal.",
