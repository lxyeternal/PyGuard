  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a simple assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable, referencing a URL for versioning standards. The code is straightforward, static, and does not involve any dynamic behavior, input/output operations, or data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \n- No reports identify any anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No code execution, network activity, or external data handling is observed.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond assigning a string to a variable.\n\n3. **Risk & Malware Scores**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with benign code.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation or complex code.\n\n4. **Evaluation of the Scores & Reasoning**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- Since the code is a standard version declaration, there is no justification for higher risk or malware scores.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions**  \n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, benign version string assignment.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates for scoring:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or complex code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk associated with static version assignment)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
