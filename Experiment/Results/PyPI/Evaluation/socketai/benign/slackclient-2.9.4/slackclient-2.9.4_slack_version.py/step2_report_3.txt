  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: `__version__ = \"2.9.4\"`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors involved.\n   - No code indicates malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple, benign version string assignment.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware score = 0\n     - obfuscated = 0\n     - securityRisk = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, referencing an external URL for versioning standards. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is benign.**\n- **No changes needed to the scores or analysis.**\n- **I agree with the current assessment: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.**",
