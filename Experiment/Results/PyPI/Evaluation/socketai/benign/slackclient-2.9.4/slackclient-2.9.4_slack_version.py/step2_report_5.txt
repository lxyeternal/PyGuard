  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code snippet is a straightforward assignment:  \n```python\n__version__ = \"2.9.4\"\n```  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a static version string assignment, with no dynamic behavior, inputs, or outputs.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages.  \n- They note the reference URL to PEP 440, which is appropriate and standard.  \n- No report mentions any hidden or suspicious code, which aligns with the code provided.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.  \n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, these scores seem reasonable.  \n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is necessary.  \n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n**Step 5: Examine malware scores for malicious activity.**  \n- The code is just a static string assignment; no malware activity is present.  \n- The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \n- All reports assume the code is benign, which is correct.  \n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are made, so no challenge needed.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores with the report content.**  \n- All reports are consistent; scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a typical, straightforward version string assignment, widely used in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious behavior or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, simple static assignment with no obfuscation.        |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.             |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and poses no security concerns.**",
