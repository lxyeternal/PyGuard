  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable, referencing PEP 440 standards via a comment. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or data flows. The code is standard in Python packaging.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \nNo report mentions any suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or potential malware behavior. The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security issues. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Justification**:  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, the risk is negligible. The only potential concern might be if the version string were dynamically fetched or if the comment linked to malicious content, but the code itself does not do that.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis is a typical, safe version string assignment with no malicious or obfuscated content, posing no security risk.",
