  "purpose": "Declare the package version following PEP 440 standards.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, referencing an external URL for versioning standards. It involves no input/output, dynamic code execution, or data processing. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current assessment and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
