  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a simple version assignment with a reference comment.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a special variable __version__, referencing PEP 440 standards. There are no input or output operations, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The comment provides a URL for versioning standards but does not execute any code or include any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward version identifier assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
