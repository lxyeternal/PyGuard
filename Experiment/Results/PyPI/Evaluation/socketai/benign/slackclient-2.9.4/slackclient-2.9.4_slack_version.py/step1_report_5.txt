  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the package/module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The version string is not used as a sink for untrusted data; it only stores static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code present; simple static assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, referencing a URL for versioning standards. No input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. This is typical for a version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier. No malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
