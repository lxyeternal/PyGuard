{
  "purpose": "Definition of a class to represent an HTTP webhook response with attributes for URL, status code, body, and headers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: url, status_code, body, headers",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data stored in attributes; no external or untrusted data flow evident",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to instance attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that assigns input parameters to instance variables. The parameters are explicitly passed during instantiation. No external data sources or sinks are invoked within this snippet. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection is present. The structure and code style are straightforward and typical for data container classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data structure for holding webhook response data with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
