  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple class that stores webhook response data with no external or malicious activity.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and no external data handling beyond the constructor parameters.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1, possibly reflecting minimal concern about data handling or benign data storage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues are **not** present in the code; the code is just a basic data container.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0, with some at 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, these are acceptable but could be standardized at 0 for clarity.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, raising the malware score would be unjustified.\n- The minimal \"securityRisk\" scores could be standardized to 0, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward data class with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, simple data storage, with no security concerns or malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or concern is necessary.",
