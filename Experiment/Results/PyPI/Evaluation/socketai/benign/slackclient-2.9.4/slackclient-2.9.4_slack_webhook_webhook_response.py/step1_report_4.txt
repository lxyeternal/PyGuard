  "purpose": "Define a class to represent HTTP webhook responses with associated data fields.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method: url, status_code, body, headers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous manner; no execution or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no unusual behaviors, and no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The class constructor takes in four parameters: url, status_code, body, headers. These are stored as object attributes. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, and no security-sensitive operations performed within this snippet. The code is straightforward and purely data structure initialization without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple data container for webhook response data. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. It does not include any network operations, credential handling, or suspicious logic.",
