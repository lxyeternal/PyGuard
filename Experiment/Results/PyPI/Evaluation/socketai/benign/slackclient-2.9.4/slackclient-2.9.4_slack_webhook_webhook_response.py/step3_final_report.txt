  "purpose": "A simple data container class for storing webhook response details such as URL, status code, body, and headers.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters: url, status_code, body, headers",
  "sinks": "None; the code only assigns parameters to instance variables",
  "flows": "Parameters flow directly into instance variables without external or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute assignment with no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that assigns input parameters to instance variables. It contains no external calls, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The class functions solely as a data container. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code's simplicity and directness indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the analysis, though the slight risk scores could be standardized to zero given the lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data class with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
