  "flows": "Input parameters -> instance variables during object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The class constructor initializes instance variables from parameters provided during object creation. No external input handling, no network operations, no secret management, or suspicious code logic. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with standard parameter assignments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely stores data passed during initialization without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
