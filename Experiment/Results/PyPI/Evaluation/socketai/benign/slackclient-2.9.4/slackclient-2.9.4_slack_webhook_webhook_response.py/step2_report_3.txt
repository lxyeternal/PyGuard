  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the corresponding code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward class that stores webhook response data.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are identified.\n- The class attributes are assigned directly from constructor parameters, with no apparent malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided. They correctly describe a simple data container class with no errors or flaws.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports suggest any malicious activity; all indicate benign, standard data structures.\n- **Security risks:** The risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, with some at 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score higher than 0.1 seems unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a plain data class with no security-sensitive operations, no external calls, and no obfuscation.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable; no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware or vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard, safe data container class for webhook responses. No further action or concern is warranted.",
