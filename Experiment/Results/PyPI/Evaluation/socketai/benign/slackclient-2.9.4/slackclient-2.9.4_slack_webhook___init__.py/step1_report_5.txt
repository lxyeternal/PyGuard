{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes related to webhook handling, including synchronous, asynchronous clients, and response processing, likely for use in a webhook integration library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .webhook_response, .client, and .async_client",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet, as it only contains import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable, since no data processing or transmission occurs within these imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module imports",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from local modules related to webhook handling. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data manipulations shown. Import statements are common and do not indicate malicious activity by themselves. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure is clear and typical for a package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign import of classes related to webhook processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for exposing classes in a Python package.",
