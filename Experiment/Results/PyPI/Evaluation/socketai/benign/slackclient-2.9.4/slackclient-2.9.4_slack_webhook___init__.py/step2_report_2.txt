  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of import statements importing local modules related to webhook handling.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent.\n   - The code appears benign and standard for a Python package setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the import statements are straightforward and do not pose security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code snippet.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is purely static imports, there's no justification for increasing these scores.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n   - They correctly interpret the import statements as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the code is benign, it's important to verify the imported modules (`webhook_response`, `client`, `async_client`) in the larger codebase for malicious behavior. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a standard set of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No changes to scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
