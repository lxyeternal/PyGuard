  "purpose": "Import statements for webhook-related classes, likely for handling webhook responses and clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: webhook_response, client, async_client.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or potential security effects identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows involving untrusted data, as the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes related to webhook handling. It does not include any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, input handling, or potential points of malicious behavior within these lines. Given the simplicity, no security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard import statements with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger package, and these lines themselves are safe.",
