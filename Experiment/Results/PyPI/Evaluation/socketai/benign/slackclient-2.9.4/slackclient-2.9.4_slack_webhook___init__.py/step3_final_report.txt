{
  "purpose": "This code imports local modules related to webhook handling, likely as part of a package's __init__.py or module setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from local modules: webhook_response, client, async_client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements do not process external input",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution beyond static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The import statements are standard and include '# noqa' comments to suppress linter warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
