  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .webhook_response import WebhookResponse  # noqa\nfrom .client import WebhookClient  # noqa\nfrom .async_client import AsyncWebhookClient  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n- The code only contains import statements from local modules: `webhook_response`, `client`, and `async_client`.\n- No functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- The imports are standard, with `# noqa` comments to suppress linter warnings.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as standard import statements related to webhook handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states that the code is only importing classes, with no data flow or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; only imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes only static import statements with no data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others; straightforward imports with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### General comments:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n- The confidence level of 1 across all reports is justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on this code fragment)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based solely on this snippet, I would agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and the reports correctly reflect that.",
