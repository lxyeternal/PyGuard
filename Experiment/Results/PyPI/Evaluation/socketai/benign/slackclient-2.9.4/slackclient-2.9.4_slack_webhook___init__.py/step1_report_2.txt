  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes related to webhook handling, likely for use in a larger application that manages webhooks.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: webhook_response, client, async_client.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or execution of untrusted code; import statements are generally safe.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; code only imports classes without executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import statements with noqa comments, standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements with no execution or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of noqa suggests suppression of linter warnings but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward import module.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard import statements for local classes related to webhook handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
