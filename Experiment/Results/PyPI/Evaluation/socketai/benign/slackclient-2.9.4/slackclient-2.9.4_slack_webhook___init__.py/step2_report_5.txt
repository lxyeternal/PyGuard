  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .webhook_response import WebhookResponse  # noqa\nfrom .client import WebhookClient  # noqa\nfrom .async_client import AsyncWebhookClient  # noqa\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements from local modules.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The use of `# noqa` suggests suppression of linter warnings but does not imply malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The code appears to be part of a package or library that provides webhook handling capabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly note that the code is benign and only contains import statements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  Not applicable here; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Malware score considerations?**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a standard module import pattern, typical in Python packages.\n- No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No adjustments needed. The code is standard, safe, and poses no security risks.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
