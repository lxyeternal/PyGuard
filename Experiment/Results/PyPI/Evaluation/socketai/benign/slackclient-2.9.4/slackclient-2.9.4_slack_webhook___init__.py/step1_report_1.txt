{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to webhook handling, including synchronous and asynchronous clients, likely for use in a larger application that interacts with webhooks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: webhook_response, client, async_client",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed in these imports",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected; imports are standard and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules related to webhook functionality. There are no functions, data handling, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. Import statements themselves are common and do not pose security risks unless the imported modules are malicious, which cannot be determined from this fragment alone. The code appears to be part of a larger, standard Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet shows standard import statements for webhook-related classes from local modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this fragment. The code appears benign.",
