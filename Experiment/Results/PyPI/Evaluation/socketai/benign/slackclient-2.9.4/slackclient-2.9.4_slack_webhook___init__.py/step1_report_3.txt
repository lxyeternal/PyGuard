{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to webhook handling, including synchronous and asynchronous clients, likely for webhook communication.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: webhook_response, client, async_client.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data processing or external output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of import statements; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes related to webhook responses and clients, both synchronous and asynchronous, from local modules. There is no data processing, no external network activity, and no suspicious logic present. This pattern is typical for a library or package setup that provides webhook-related functionalities. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not handle untrusted data nor perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import setup for webhook functionalities without any malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain any malware or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
