  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for Slack API error handling.\n- No external data input, output, or processing occurs.\n- The constructor in SlackApiError captures a message and response object, but this is standard for error reporting.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is purely class definitions for exceptions.\n- No evidence of code injection, malicious logic, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- No external data handling or processing that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None identified. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for defining custom exceptions.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's nature, a score above 0.1 isn't justified unless there is hidden malicious intent, which isn't evident.\n\n### Justifications:\n- **Higher risk scores (>0.5):** Not justified. The code is purely structural, with no active operations or external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should be 0, as the code is transparent.\n- **Security risk:** Should stay at 0, since no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The inclusion of the response object in `SlackApiError` could, in theory, contain sensitive data if logged or mishandled elsewhere. However, in this code snippet, it’s just stored as an attribute; there's no evidence of data leakage or malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified based solely on exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes with no malicious or security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider how these exceptions are used in the broader application. If exception messages or response objects are logged or exposed insecurely elsewhere, that could introduce security risks. But based solely on this code snippet, no issues are present.",
