{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various Slack client errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception messages and responses are handled internally.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted directly, only exception messages and response objects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception handling involves internal message construction and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely provides custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. The constructor in SlackApiError incorporates a message and response object, but there's no handling of untrusted input or external data that could lead to vulnerabilities. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward, focused on error definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for Slack API error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
