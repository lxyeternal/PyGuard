  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes for Slack API error handling.\n   - No external input, data processing, or network operations are present.\n   - The constructor in `SlackApiError` incorporates a message and response object, but this is standard for error reporting and does not pose security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n   - They mention that the response object could contain sensitive data if improperly handled downstream, but this is an implementation concern outside the scope of these class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. This is reasonable since the only potential concern is that the response object could contain sensitive data, but that is not an inherent flaw in the code itself.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a high risk score. The highest is 0.1, which is justified by the possibility of sensitive data exposure if the response object is mishandled later, not by the code itself.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where there is none. They recognize that the response object could contain sensitive data but do not consider this a vulnerability in the code itself.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Slack API error handling.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The minor security concern about the response object containing sensitive data is acknowledged but does not imply malicious intent or vulnerability in the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign, standard exception classes with no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is safe and does not pose security threats.",
