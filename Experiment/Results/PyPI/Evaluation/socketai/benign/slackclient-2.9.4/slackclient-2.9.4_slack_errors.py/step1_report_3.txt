{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various Slack client errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; purely class definitions and error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes do not process or transmit data beyond their initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only custom exception class definitions related to Slack API errors. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks present. The classes do not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or external file operations. The constructor in SlackApiError captures response data, but this is typical for error reporting and does not suggest malicious intent. There are no indications of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Overall, the code serves a standard purpose of defining error classes without executing any risky or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for Slack client error handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
