  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the potential for security issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Slack API errors.\n- No external input/output, data processing, or network activity occurs within these classes.\n- The constructor in `SlackApiError` includes a response object, but this is standard for error reporting and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence of data leakage, injection, or backdoors.\n   - The inclusion of response data in exceptions is typical for debugging and error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Some reports assign a very low security risk (e.g., 0.1), which might reflect a cautious approach, but given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n   - The overall risk scores are very low, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external data handling, the risk should remain minimal.\n   - The only minor point is that including response data in exceptions could, if mishandled elsewhere, leak sensitive info. However, within this code alone, this is not a concern.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; the reports are cautious but accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple exception classes with no security issues.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, reflecting minimal risk; perhaps slightly higher due to potential data leakage if response data is sensitive, but not in this context)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for Slack API error handling. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain low.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
