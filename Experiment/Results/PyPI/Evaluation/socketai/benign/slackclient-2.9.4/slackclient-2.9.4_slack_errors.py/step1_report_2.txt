{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various Slack client errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exception messages and responses are used internally or passed during exception raising.",
  "sinks": "The __init__ method in SlackApiError constructs a message that includes the response object, which could potentially contain sensitive data if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Exception message and response data flow from the point of error detection to logging or handling mechanisms that may display or log the information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears standard for exception handling with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exceptions inheriting from the base Exception class, tailored for Slack API error handling. The classes serve as structured error types. The SlackApiError class captures a response object, but there is no evidence of data leakage or malicious behavior. The overall structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for Slack API error handling. No malicious activity, supply chain threats, or security risks are present.",
