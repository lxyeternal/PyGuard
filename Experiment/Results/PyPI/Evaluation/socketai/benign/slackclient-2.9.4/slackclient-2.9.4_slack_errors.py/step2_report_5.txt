  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions related to Slack API error handling.\n- No external input, data processing, or network communication occurs.\n- Exception messages and response objects are handled internally, with no evidence of untrusted data being processed insecurely.\n- The constructor in SlackApiError captures a response object, which could contain sensitive data, but this is standard practice for error reporting and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The overall structure is straightforward and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The only minor discrepancy is in report 4, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, this is an overestimation. It might be considering the fact that response data could contain sensitive info, but this is standard in error handling and not a vulnerability.\n\n**Risk scores:**\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is still very low and likely overestimated given the code's context.\n- Since no actual processing of untrusted data occurs, and no malicious code is present, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n\n**Malware scores:**\n- All reports correctly identify malware as 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Obfuscated scores:**\n- All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The slight elevation in report 4's securityRisk score is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.",
