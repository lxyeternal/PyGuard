  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Slack API errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exception classes are instantiated during error handling.",
  "sinks": "None; exception classes do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Error occurs during Slack API interactions; exceptions are raised with messages and response data, but no data flows are present within these class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The response object in SlackApiError could contain sensitive data if logged or mishandled externally, but this is standard for error reporting and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to Slack API errors. No external input, data processing, or network activity occurs within these classes. The constructor in SlackApiError captures a message and response object, which is typical for error reporting. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are evident. The response object could contain sensitive data if mishandled outside this context, but within this code, it remains an attribute. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Slack API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight concern about the response object containing sensitive data is a general caution, not an indication of malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
