{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Slack client errors",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; exception messages and response objects are set internally",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points identified; exception handling does not involve external data manipulation",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up exception classes with attributes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; all classes are standard exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to Slack API errors. These classes are purely for error handling and do not perform any data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. The constructor in SlackApiError stores a response object and constructs an error message, but this is typical for exception classes. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. All elements are standard class definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of custom exception classes for Slack API error handling, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation present.",
