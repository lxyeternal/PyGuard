  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Slack API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight concern about the response object containing sensitive data is a general caution, not an indication of malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat."
