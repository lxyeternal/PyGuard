  "purpose": "The code constructs request bodies and headers for Slack webhooks and logs responses for debugging.",
  "sources": "get_user_agent() and convert_bool_to_0_or_1() functions, input parameters to _build_body, _build_request_headers, and _debug_log_response",
  "sinks": "Update of request headers, logging output",
  "flows": "Input parameters to request header construction, response object to logging output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard libraries and functions. No obfuscated code or suspicious control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be part of a Slack webhook utility, responsible for building request bodies and headers, and logging responses. It uses imported functions for user agent retrieval and boolean conversion, and processes data structures without executing untrusted code. The logging function only logs at debug level, which is typical for debugging purposes. No malicious or suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are evident. No external network communication beyond typical HTTP request headers is present, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as intended for request preparation and response logging within a Slack webhook context. No malicious behavior or security threats are identified.",
