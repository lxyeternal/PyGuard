{
  "purpose": "The code constructs request bodies and headers for Slack webhooks and logs webhook responses for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes original_body (Dict), default_headers (Dict), additional_headers (Dict), and resp (WebhookResponse).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs HTTP request headers and body, and logs response data. The response data could potentially leak if logging is misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Input data (original_body, headers) is processed and combined into request payloads; response data is logged for debugging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses external utility functions without suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles building request data and logging responses. It conditionally includes data based on input parameters and logging levels. External functions like get_user_agent, convert_bool_to_0_or_1, and _parse_web_class_objects are used, but their presence alone is not suspicious. Response logging respects logging levels to prevent leaking sensitive data unless debugging is enabled. No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for constructing Slack webhook requests and debugging responses. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
