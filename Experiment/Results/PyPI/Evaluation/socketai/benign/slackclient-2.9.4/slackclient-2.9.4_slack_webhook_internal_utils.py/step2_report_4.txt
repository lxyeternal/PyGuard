  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for constructing request bodies, headers, and debugging responses. Uses standard imported functions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. Usage of imported functions appears benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate with high confidence (1). Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, constructing request data and logging responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation. Response logging is conditional on log level, which is good practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly less than perfect confidence (0.9), but still very high. Malware score remains 0, security risk very low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, request construction and response logging.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation. External functions are used but appear benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1), malware score 0, security risk minimal.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same utility functions, external functions not defined here.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is thorough; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request and logging utilities.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Full confidence (1), malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low, 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe code is a standard utility module for Slack API interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential logging of response data, which could leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but this is mitigated by logging level checks)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and well-structured. The scoring aligns with the actual analysis.",
