  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing request bodies, headers, and logging responses in Slack webhook interactions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and imported functions such as get_user_agent(), convert_bool_to_0_or_1(), and _parse_web_class_objects().",
  "sinks": "Response body and headers used in HTTP requests; response body logged for debugging purposes.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters flows into request body and headers; response object is logged based on log level.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; response logging conditioned on log level to prevent leaks; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with utility functions for request construction and response logging. External functions used are standard and benign. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Response logging is conditioned on log level, which is good practice. The security risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects potential for sensitive data exposure via logs, but this is a common and manageable concern. Malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern related to response logging is justified but not indicative of any security breach. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
