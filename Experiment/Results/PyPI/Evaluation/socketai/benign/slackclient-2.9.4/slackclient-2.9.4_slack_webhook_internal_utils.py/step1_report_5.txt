  "purpose": "Helper functions for building request bodies, headers, and logging responses in a Slack web API context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (_build_body, _build_request_headers, _debug_log_response), external imported functions (get_user_agent, convert_bool_to_0_or_1, _parse_web_class_objects).",
  "sinks": "Request headers construction and logging functions; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data from input parameters flows through functions, with no external data sources or sinks leading to malicious behavior. _build_body processes a dict, _build_request_headers combines headers, _debug_log_response logs response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No unsafe code patterns or obfuscation observed. Usage of external functions appears standard for request construction and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for constructing HTTP request bodies and headers, and for debug logging. It imports functions that retrieve user agent strings and parse web class objects, which are common in API request setups. The functions handle data processing and logging in a typical manner, with no signs of malicious activity. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling that leads to insecure operations, and no suspicious external calls. The code appears clean, straightforward, and standard for API interaction and logging tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs standard request setup and logging functions typical in web API clients. No malicious or maliciously intended code is detected.",
