  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing request bodies, headers, and debugging responses in Slack web integrations.",
  "sources": "get_user_agent() for user agent string, convert_bool_to_0_or_1() for boolean conversion, _parse_web_class_objects() for processing body objects, resp.headers and resp.body from WebhookResponse.",
  "sinks": "None directly; all functions process data for HTTP requests and responses, primarily in memory.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and imported functions flow through building request body and headers, and are logged during response debugging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of imported utility functions appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to build request bodies and headers, and to log responses. It uses standard practices for request construction, including dynamic header management and response logging at debug level. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or unsafe code practices. All imported functions are used in a benign manner. The code is straightforward and well-structured with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for a Slack web integration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
