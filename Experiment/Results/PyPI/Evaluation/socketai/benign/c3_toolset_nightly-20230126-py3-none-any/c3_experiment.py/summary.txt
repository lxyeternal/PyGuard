  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured quantum experiment simulation framework with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only minor concern is the use of pickle for data storage, which is standard but should be handled carefully if untrusted files are loaded. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
