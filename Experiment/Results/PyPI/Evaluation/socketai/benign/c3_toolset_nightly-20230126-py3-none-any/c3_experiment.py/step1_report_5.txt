{
  "purpose": "The code models and simulates quantum experiments, including configuration, gate computation, state evolution, and result processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from configuration files (hjson, JSON), environment variables (os), and possibly user-defined parameters via method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files (pickle, txt, json), but only in specified log directories; no network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration files into model and parameter objects; through simulation steps via propagators; and outputs are stored locally in files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Use of dynamic imports or eval-like functions is absent. No obfuscated code detected. No hidden or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive quantum experiment simulation framework. It reads configuration files, constructs models, computes propagators, and performs state evolution. It uses standard libraries and follows normal design patterns. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution mechanisms are present. File operations are limited to local configuration reading and optional local storage of results. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are identified. Overall, the code appears to serve its intended simulation purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate quantum experiment simulation tool with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on local data and performs typical scientific computations. No malware or security risks are detected.",
