  "purpose": "This code implements a quantum experiment simulation framework, managing configuration loading, propagator computation, and state evolution for quantum systems.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (hjson, JSON), model, generator, instructions, and internal parameters.",
  "sinks": "Local file storage (pickle, text files, JSON); no network activity or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into internal models and instructions; propagator computations and state evolutions occur locally; results stored in files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for saving propagators; dynamic assignment of propagation methods; no suspicious code obfuscation or external code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard quantum simulation class with configuration management, propagator calculation, and state evolution routines. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code detected. The use of pickle is typical for internal data serialization but can be risky if loading untrusted files; however, in this context, it is only used for dumping data. The dynamic method assignment and configuration loading are controlled and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears legitimate and free of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured quantum experiment simulation framework with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only minor concern is the use of pickle for data storage, which is standard but should be handled carefully if untrusted files are loaded. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
