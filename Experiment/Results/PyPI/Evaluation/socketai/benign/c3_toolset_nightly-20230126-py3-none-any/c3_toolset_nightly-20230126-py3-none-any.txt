      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured quantum experiment simulation framework with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only minor concern is the use of pickle for data storage, which is standard but should be handled carefully if untrusted files are loaded. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, configuration-driven orchestration tool with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main potential security concern is reliance on external configuration files, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but the code itself is safe."

      "conclusion": "The reports' scoring aligns well with their descriptions and reasoning. The primary adjustment is to slightly increase the obfuscated score for Report 4 to better capture the suspicion of obfuscation. No evidence of confirmed malware or obfuscation exists; the overall security risk remains low to moderate based on described features."
