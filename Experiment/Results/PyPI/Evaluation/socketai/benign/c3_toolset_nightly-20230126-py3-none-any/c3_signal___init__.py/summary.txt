  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring aligns well with their descriptions and reasoning. The primary adjustment is to slightly increase the obfuscated score for Report 4 to better capture the suspicion of obfuscation. No evidence of confirmed malware or obfuscation exists; the overall security risk remains low to moderate based on described features."
