{
  "purpose": "This code implements a quantum system modeling framework, handling configuration parsing, Hamiltonian calculations, basis transformations, and state management for quantum simulations.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (loaded via 'read_config'), input parameters for Hamiltonian and basis transformations, external data in configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files into internal structures; Hamiltonian and basis transformation functions process internal data; no external data flows or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is clear and structured for scientific computation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard quantum modeling class with configuration parsing, Hamiltonian computation, basis transformations, and state management. It does not contain network activity, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are present. The security measures are typical for scientific software, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent quantum simulation framework with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
