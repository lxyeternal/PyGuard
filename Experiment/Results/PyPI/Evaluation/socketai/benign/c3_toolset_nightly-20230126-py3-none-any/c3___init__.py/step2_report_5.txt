  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, sinks, data flows, or suspicious operations.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a straightforward version string assignment with no anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The summaries appropriately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and contain no mistakes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious activity, no reason exists to assign a high risk score.\n   - The highest risk score is 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, so this score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they simply state that the code is a static version string assignment.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward and readable)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard version string assignment, common in Python packages. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
