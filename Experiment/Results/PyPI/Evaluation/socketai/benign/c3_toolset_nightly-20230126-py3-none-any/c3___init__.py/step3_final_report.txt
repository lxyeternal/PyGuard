  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a static string ('20230126') to the __version__ variable. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is a standard practice in Python modules for versioning, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a version identifier. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No security concerns or malicious activity are present, and no modifications are necessary.",
