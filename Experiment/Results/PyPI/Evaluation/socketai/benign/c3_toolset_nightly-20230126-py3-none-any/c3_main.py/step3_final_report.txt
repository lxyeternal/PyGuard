{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and executes an optimization process based on configuration files, setting up models, generators, experiments, and optimizers as specified.",
  "sources": "Configuration files read via hjson, initial points and experimental data loaded from specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "File operations for loading initial points and experimental data; no network or system command execution detected.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into model, generator, experiment, and optimizer setup; initial points are loaded from files; no external network or command flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward orchestration script that reads configuration files, sets up models, generators, experiments, and optimizers, then runs the optimization unless in debug mode. It performs standard file I/O, object instantiation, and configuration parsing. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear and follows common practices for such workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, configuration-driven orchestration tool with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main potential security concern is reliance on external configuration files, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but the code itself is safe.",
