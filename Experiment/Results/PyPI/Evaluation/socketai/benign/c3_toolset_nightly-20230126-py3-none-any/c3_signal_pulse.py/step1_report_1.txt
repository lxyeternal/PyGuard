{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for envelope shaping and carrier signals used in pulse design, including configuration serialization.",
  "sources": "Reading class parameters, function calls for envelope shapes, file writing via open() and hjson.dump().",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration files, potentially vulnerable to path injection if filepath is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Parameters are read during class instantiation and used in shape computations; configuration data is written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity, no unusual code constructs, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for managing pulse envelope parameters and serialization. It uses standard Python and TensorFlow features with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or network activity. File operations are straightforward and limited to writing configuration files. The only potential concern is reliance on external inputs for file paths, which could be exploited in a broader context, but this is typical for configuration serialization and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for pulse shaping and signal configuration serialization. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks within this module.",
