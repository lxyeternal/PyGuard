{
  "purpose": "Define classes and methods for shaping and managing pulse envelopes and carriers in quantum or signal processing systems.",
  "sources": "File open for writing configuration files (write_config methods), access to class parameters, shape functions, and shape evaluation within class methods.",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration files (potentially sensitive data), no untrusted external data sources, no direct data leaks or malicious external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Parameters and shape functions flow through class methods, configurations are dumped to files, shape values are computed via shape functions and masks, but no external or untrusted data influences these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs observed. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present. Use of complex data structures and file operations are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes for pulse shaping with configuration export functions and shape computations. No evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious actions. The shape functions are passed as callables and used internally. File writing is limited to configuration files and appears benign. No signs of malicious backdoors or malicious code patterns are present. The usage of tf.GradientTape and TensorFlow functions is consistent with typical signal processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for pulse envelope and carrier management. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The file operations are standard and confined to configuration exports. Overall, the code is benign with no malicious intent detected.",
