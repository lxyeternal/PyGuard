{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for pulse envelope shaping and carrier signals, with configuration serialization via file I/O, for signal processing or quantum control applications.",
  "sources": "Reading parameters from class attributes, external shape functions, and writing configuration files to specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration data to files; no network or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Parameters are set during class initialization; configuration data is serialized via write_config() method; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. File paths are user-controlled but standard for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for pulse envelope and carrier configuration, utilizing TensorFlow for shape computations and file I/O for serialization. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of external shape functions is standard, and parameters are managed with validation. The file writing operations are typical for configuration purposes. Potential concerns about file path handling are standard and not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for pulse shaping and configuration serialization. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical configuration file handling. The low risk scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
