{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'aresponses' Python package, used for asyncio response mocking and testing.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; primarily static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into 'long_description' variable, used during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network connections or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, reads a local README file for documentation, and calls setup() with static package configuration. No user input, no environment variables influencing control flow, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors. All dependencies are specified with version constraints to ensure compatibility. The setup configuration appears standard and legitimate for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply reads static documentation and configures package metadata for distribution.",
