  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'aresponses' Python package, used for asyncio response mocking in tests.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from os.path; uses package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily loads static configuration and package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md into long_description variable; no untrusted data flow or external data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. All code appears standard for a setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies based on Python version, and registers a pytest plugin. No code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. No dynamic code or obfuscation identified. No external network activity or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or security-risk behaviors detected. It contains no hidden code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
