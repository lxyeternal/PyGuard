  "purpose": "A utility function to match text against a pattern, with compatibility for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Pattern parameter input, text parameter input",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or leaked",
  "flows": "Pattern (string or regex object) compared against text to determine match",
  "anomalies": "The 'ANY' pattern is defined but not used; compatibility code for re.Pattern detection",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern 'ANY' that matches all strings. The function '_text_matches_pattern' checks if the pattern matches the provided text, handling compatibility with older Python versions by trying to access re.Pattern or re._pattern_type. It compares the pattern as a string or regex object with the text, returning True if matched. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The 'ANY' pattern is harmless and unused, serving as a default catch-all. The compatibility code is standard. Overall, the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign pattern matching utility with compatibility considerations. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
