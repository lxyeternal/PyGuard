{
  "purpose": "Define a helper function to check if a given text matches a regex pattern, with compatibility for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'pattern' and 'text'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is sent or leaked outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'pattern' and 'text' are checked and matched; no external data flow or output manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a compatibility workaround for 're.Pattern' which is typical for supporting older Python versions; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and pre-compiles a regex pattern 'ANY' matching everything. The function '_text_matches_pattern' checks if 'pattern' is a string or a compiled regex object and performs matching accordingly. It includes a try-except block to support different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The function appears to be a standard utility for pattern matching with backward compatibility considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for regex pattern matching with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It supports older Python versions and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
