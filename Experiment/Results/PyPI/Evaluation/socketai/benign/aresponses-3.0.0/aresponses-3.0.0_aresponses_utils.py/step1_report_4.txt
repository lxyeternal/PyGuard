{
  "purpose": "This code defines a regular expression pattern and a function to match text against a pattern, primarily for pattern matching compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'text' in the '_text_matches_pattern' function, and the 'pattern' argument passed to that function. The module-level variable 'ANY' is a compiled regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output data; it only performs pattern matching. There are no sinks related to untrusted data leading to leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Input 'pattern' and 'text' flow into the '_text_matches_pattern' function, where they are checked against each other. No further data flow or external interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The 'ANY' pattern matches any string, which might be unnecessary but is not inherently malicious. The function includes compatibility code for old Python versions, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple utility for matching text against a pattern, with consideration for compatibility across Python versions. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of 'ANY' as a pattern is benign, perhaps for default matches. The code appears straightforward and intentionally simple, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for pattern matching, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves a straightforward purpose without any suspicious or malicious code.",
