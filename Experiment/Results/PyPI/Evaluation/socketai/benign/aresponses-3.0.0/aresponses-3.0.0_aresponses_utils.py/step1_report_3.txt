{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to match a text against a pattern, with compatibility considerations for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The function _text_matches_pattern reads input data through its parameters 'pattern' and 'text'. The variable 'ANY' is a compiled regex pattern that matches any string.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, system commands, or other security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data 'text' is compared against 'pattern' or the predefined 'ANY' pattern to determine a match; no untrusted data flows into system-critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic pattern type detection for compatibility is benign. The 'ANY' pattern is very permissive, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global regex pattern 'ANY' that matches everything. The function '_text_matches_pattern' checks whether the provided 'pattern' matches 'text'. It includes a try-except block to determine the correct regex pattern class for compatibility with older Python versions. If 'pattern' is a string, it compares directly with 'text'. If 'pattern' is a regex object, it performs a search. There are no external data sources, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to be utility code for pattern matching with version compatibility considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, version-compatible pattern matching utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is benign and designed for safe pattern matching tasks.",
