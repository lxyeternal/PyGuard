  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple utility for pattern matching, with compatibility for older Python versions.\n- No external data flows, sinks, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The 'ANY' pattern is benign, matching all strings, and is not used maliciously.\n- The code does not perform any system modifications, network operations, or data exfiltration.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports accurately describe the code's functionality and characteristics.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign utility functions.\n\n- **Potential misinterpretations?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. They align with the code's behavior and the detailed analysis.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- **Why is the risk score 0.0?**  \n  Because the code performs only pattern matching with compatibility considerations, with no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or dangerous behaviors.\n\n### Malware and Potential Assumptions:\n- No claims of malicious behavior are made or implied.\n- The use of 'ANY' is benign and not a backdoor or malicious pattern.\n- Compatibility code is standard and not suspicious.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign utility function for pattern matching, with no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The compatibility code is standard practice, and the 'ANY' pattern is harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed. The code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
