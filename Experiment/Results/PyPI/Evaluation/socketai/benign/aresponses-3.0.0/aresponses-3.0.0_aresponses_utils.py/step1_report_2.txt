  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a text matches a given pattern, compatible with different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'pattern' and 'text' within the function _text_matches_pattern.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching logic; no external data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Pattern and text are checked and compared; no external data flow or untrusted source to sink path detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code structures observed. The pattern 'ANY' is defined but not used; it appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern 'ANY' that matches everything, and a helper function '_text_matches_pattern' which checks if a text matches a pattern. The function includes compatibility code for different Python versions. It compares input pattern (string or compiled regex) against the text. No input sanitization, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for pattern matching tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for pattern matching with compatibility considerations. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
