  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard aiohttp server with no malicious behavior or backdoors. The main concern is the lack of input validation for the 'protocol' parameter, which should be sanitized in production. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate."
