  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from AssertionError or other custom exceptions.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or network interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be error categorization within a testing or mocking framework.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and safe.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Security risk score: 0, malware score: 0, confidence: 1.\n- *Assessment:* Fully accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of data handling or external interactions.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the purpose as defining exceptions for testing/mocking.\n- No external data or malicious patterns.\n- Scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusions; straightforward class definitions.\n- No anomalies or risks identified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also consistent; no suspicious behavior.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 across all reports, justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
