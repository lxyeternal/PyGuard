{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to response assertion errors for a hypothetical or existing response mocking/testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for response assertions, likely used in testing frameworks. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The code is straightforward, with clear inheritance from standard exception classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as custom exception class definitions. It contains no malware or security issues.",
