  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AssertionError or related exceptions.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or malicious patterns are observed.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; the code only defines exception classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- Similar analysis; straightforward class definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- Same reasoning; no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**However,** considering the role of this code:\n- It is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- There are no dynamic or external components.\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The scores reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, and the scoring aligns with its functionality. No further action needed.",
