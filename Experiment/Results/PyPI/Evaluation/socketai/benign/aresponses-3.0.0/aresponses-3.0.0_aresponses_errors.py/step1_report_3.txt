  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to assertions and route handling errors for a mocking or testing framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with inheritance from AssertionError.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply class inheritance and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes that inherit from AssertionError and other custom exceptions. These classes are intended for use in error handling within a testing or mocking context. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns or behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions without any obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines custom exception classes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard in structure and purpose, with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
