  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to response assertions and routing.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only class definitions with inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no untrusted data handling, no output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only class inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from AssertionError, specifically for response assertion errors and route-related errors. There are no inputs, data handling, or external interactions. The structure is simple and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for error handling in Python. No malware, anomalous behavior, or security concerns are detected.",
