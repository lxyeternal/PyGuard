  "purpose": "Defines custom assertion error classes for use in a response mocking/testing framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from AssertionError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources or sinks; class inheritance is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes that inherit from AssertionError, indicating they are intended for specific error handling scenarios within a testing or mocking context. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions. The class hierarchy appears standard and lacks any malicious patterns or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for structured error handling.",
