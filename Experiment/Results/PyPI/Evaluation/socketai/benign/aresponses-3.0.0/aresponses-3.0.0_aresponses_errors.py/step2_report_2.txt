  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AssertionError or related classes.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be error categorization within a testing or mocking framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe, purely structural.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high, given the simplicity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard pattern, no external data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on testing/mocking context, same pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, standard exception class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports confirm that the code is purely defining custom exception classes with no data handling, external communication, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 in all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n- No adjustments needed; all scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, safe pattern for defining custom exceptions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores and reasoning across all reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is necessary.",
