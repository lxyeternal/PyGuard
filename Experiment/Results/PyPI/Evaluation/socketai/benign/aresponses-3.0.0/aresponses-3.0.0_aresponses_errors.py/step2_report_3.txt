  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes, inheriting from AssertionError or other custom exceptions.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a testing or mocking framework, which is a common pattern.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is clearly to categorize errors related to response assertions and routing.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- There are no logical errors, flaws, or mistakes in the code snippets provided.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is purely structural.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence score is 1, which seems justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is only defining exception classes, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No higher scores are justified because there are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior.\n- They acknowledge the code's purpose and context without overgeneralizing.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward class definitions.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and serves as error categorization within a testing or mocking framework. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely structural with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
