  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AssertionError or related exceptions.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be error categorization within a testing or mocking framework.\n- The confidence scores are uniformly 1, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature described.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it is purely structural and standard.\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The reasoning dismisses any potential for hidden malicious behavior, which is justified given the simplicity and purpose of the code.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or suggestions:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected, supporting the current scoring.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a testing/mocking framework. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.",
