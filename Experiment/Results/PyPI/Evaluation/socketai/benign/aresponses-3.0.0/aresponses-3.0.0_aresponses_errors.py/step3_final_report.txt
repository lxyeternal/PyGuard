  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for response assertion errors and related error types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from AssertionError and related exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions, inheriting from AssertionError and other related exceptions. There are no data flows, external inputs, or malicious behaviors. The code is simple, standard, and serves as error categorization within a testing or mocking framework. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments or further analysis are necessary.",
