  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for aresponses assertion errors and specific error types related to routing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from AssertionError, NoRouteFoundError, UnusedRouteError, UnorderedRouteCallError",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data or external inputs",
  "flows": "No data flows present; only class inheritance hierarchies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. It inherits from standard exception classes, which is typical for error categorization. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code appears to be part of a larger application, focusing on error handling for an HTTP mocking library or similar component.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
