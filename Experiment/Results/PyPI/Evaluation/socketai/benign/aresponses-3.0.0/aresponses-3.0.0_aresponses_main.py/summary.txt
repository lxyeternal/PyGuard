  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility with no malicious intent. The internal class patching is standard for such tools and does not constitute malicious behavior. The potential security risk is minimal and confined to testing contexts. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
