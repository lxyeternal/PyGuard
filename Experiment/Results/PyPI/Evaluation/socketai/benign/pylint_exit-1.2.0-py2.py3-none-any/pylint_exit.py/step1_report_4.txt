  "purpose": "The script manages and interprets pylint exit codes, providing user-friendly output and configurable enforcement settings for message levels.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command line arguments (pylint return code and CLI flags).",
  "sinks": "Output is written to the console (print statements).",
  "flows": "Source: pylint exit code input -> decode and interpret messages -> display messages and enforce settings based on CLI flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations. The code appears purely for managing pylint exit codes and user interface. No obfuscated code, external data fetching, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes pylint return codes, decoding them to display specific message levels and determine exit status. It allows command-line configuration to fail on specific message types. The logic is straightforward, with no external data fetching, network activity, or system modification beyond process exit. The functions perform data parsing, output formatting, and enforcement logic. No anomalous or suspicious code patterns identified. No embedded malicious payloads, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility script for managing pylint exit codes with configurable failure conditions. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security risks. It is a benign utility for development workflows.",
