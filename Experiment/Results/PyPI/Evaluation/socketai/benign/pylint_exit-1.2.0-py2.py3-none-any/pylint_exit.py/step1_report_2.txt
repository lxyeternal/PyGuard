  "purpose": "The script manages and interprets pylint exit codes, decoding them, displaying messages, and applying user-defined enforcement rules for code quality checks.",
  "sources": "Input source is the pylint return code provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs messages to the console and exits with a specific code; no external network or data storage is involved.",
  "flows": "The pylint return code is input via command-line, decoded to extract messages, which are then displayed, and an exit code is determined and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No suspicious external connections or data leaks are detected. The code primarily handles display logic and configuration adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for interpreting pylint's return codes, decoding bit-encoded message flags, and managing enforcement settings through command-line options. It includes functions for decoding, message extraction, and applying user preferences for error/warning handling. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or system alterations beyond standard exit codes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are evident. The script strictly manages input, processing, and output related to pylint status codes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for interpreting pylint exit statuses and configuring enforcement rules. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and primarily focused on user interaction and output formatting.",
