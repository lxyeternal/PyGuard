  "purpose": "This script interprets pylint exit codes, decodes bitwise flags into human-readable messages, and manages enforcement settings via CLI flags.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument input (pylint exit code, enforcement flags)",
  "sinks": "Console output (messages, status reports)",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> decode() -> get_messages() -> display messages -> determine exit code -> output final status",
  "anomalies": "The decode() function incorrectly processes bits, returning only message strings instead of full tuples, leading to potential inconsistencies in downstream functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for decoding pylint exit codes, displaying messages, and setting enforcement flags. No external network, file, or system modifications are performed. The decode() function has a bug: it uses format(value, \"b\") reversed and zips bits with exit_code_list, but only returns message strings, losing other tuple data. This inconsistency could cause errors in functions like show_workings() that expect full tuples. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. The code is transparent, well-documented, and safe. The only concern is the functional bug in decode(), which affects message decoding but not security. Correcting decode() to return full tuples would improve reliability.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility with a minor functional bug in decode(). It does not pose security risks or contain malicious code. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) is justified. Fixing decode() would ensure consistent behavior. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its purpose.",
