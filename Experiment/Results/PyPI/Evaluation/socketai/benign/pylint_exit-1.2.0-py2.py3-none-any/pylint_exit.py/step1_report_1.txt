  "purpose": "This script processes pylint exit codes, decodes them, and displays relevant messages, also allowing enforcement settings via CLI options.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the command line argument 'pylint_exit_code'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; output is printed to the console. No external network or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Input (pylint return code) -> decode functions -> display messages and determine exit status -> sys.exit().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manipulates and displays data without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility for interpreting pylint exit codes. It decodes bit-encoded status codes into human-readable messages, allows enforcement adjustments via CLI flags, and outputs status messages. The functions perform straightforward data processing and display. There are no network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications. The code structure is consistent with standard CLI utilities and does not include obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for handling pylint exit codes and does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It strictly processes input and outputs messages without external communication or side effects.",
