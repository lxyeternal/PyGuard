{
  "purpose": "The script processes pylint exit codes to decode, display, and enforce specific message levels based on user-configurable options, mainly for integrating pylint results into CI/CD workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input via command line argument 'pylint_exit_code'. Uses argparse to parse CLI flags and arguments.",
  "sinks": "Prints messages to stdout; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files. Modifies internal data structures for enforcement settings.",
  "flows": "Input pylint code -> decode -> display messages -> enforce rules based on CLI flags -> determine exit status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; the code appears to be a straightforward utility for interpreting pylint exit codes and enforcing rules based on CLI options.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility script that interprets pylint exit codes, decodes the bitwise flags into human-readable messages, and applies user-specified enforcement rules through command-line flags. It does not handle untrusted input beyond CLI arguments, and it does not perform external network operations or system modifications. The functions are primarily for parsing, decoding, displaying messages, and setting enforcement flags. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The script's logic is clear, structured, and aligns with typical CLI utility patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The overall security risk is very low, and confidence is high in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-based script designed for interpreting and enforcing pylint message levels. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
