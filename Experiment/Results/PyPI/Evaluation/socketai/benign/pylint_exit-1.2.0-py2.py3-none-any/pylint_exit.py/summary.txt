  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility with a minor functional bug in decode(). It does not pose security risks or contain malicious code. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) is justified. Fixing decode() would ensure consistent behavior. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its purpose."
