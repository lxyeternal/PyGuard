      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for dbt coverage analysis. The high security risk scores (e.g., 0.95) in some reports are overstated; a more accurate risk estimate is near zero, around 0.05-0.1. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is safe for use."
