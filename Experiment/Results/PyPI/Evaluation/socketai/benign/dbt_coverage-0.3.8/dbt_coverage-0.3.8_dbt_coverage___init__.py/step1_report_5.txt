{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to analyze dbt project artifacts (manifest.json and catalog.json) to compute and compare coverage reports for data warehouse models, tables, and columns.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files (manifest.json, catalog.json) from filesystem, and input parameters from command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs coverage reports in JSON, markdown, or formatted string to console or files; raises RuntimeError on coverage failures; logs information and warnings.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON files from filesystem -> Parses manifest and catalog data structures -> Computes coverage metrics -> Outputs reports or raises errors based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard Python libraries and command-line parsing via 'typer'. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically loads JSON artifacts (manifest and catalog), processes and filters tables and columns, and computes coverage metrics. It contains functions to load, parse, filter, and generate reports. It performs expected file operations, data parsing, and report generation with no signs of malicious behavior. No embedded code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted input beyond file reading, and no suspicious data leaks are evident. The structure and logic align with legitimate functionality for coverage analysis, with safe usage of libraries and clear control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate tool for analyzing dbt project coverage reports. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. The code performs expected file I/O and report processing without suspicious or malicious activity.",
