  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or effects are caused.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. This is a common and legitimate pattern for Python package setup scripts. No external data is read, no sensitive information is accessed or leaked. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or unusual activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
