  "purpose": "Defines a unittest.TestCase subclass with test methods, each augmented with custom attributes for metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "Method definitions and subsequent attribute assignments to the test methods.",
  "sinks": "No external inputs, data flows, or untrusted data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional attribute assignments directly to methods after their definitions; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test class with placeholder methods. Additional attributes are assigned to methods post-definition, which is syntactically valid but unusual. No external data, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. The attributes serve as metadata and do not influence control flow or security. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The unconventional attribute assignments do not pose security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
