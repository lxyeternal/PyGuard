{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions from the 'nose2' testing framework and defines module metadata and exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'nose2.main' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Imported functions are made available for external use, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; minimal code with standard imports and definitions",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific functions from the 'nose2' testing library, sets a version string, and defines what is exported when the module is imported. There are no signs of data manipulation, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears to be part of a test suite setup, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
