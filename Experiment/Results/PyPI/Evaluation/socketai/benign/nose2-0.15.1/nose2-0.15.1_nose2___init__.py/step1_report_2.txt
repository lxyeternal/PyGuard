  "purpose": "Define module metadata and expose specific functions from nose2.main",
  "sources": "Import statement from nose2.main",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows, just imports and variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions 'discover' and 'main' from the 'nose2.main' module, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical module initialization snippet, with no external data handling or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module metadata and function export setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
