  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for test framework error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; code primarily defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a comment indicating copied code, but no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes for a testing framework, along with a comment about code origins. The exception classes do not contain any methods or data that could be malicious. The comment suggests code copying but does not imply malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No external data input, network activity, or sensitive information handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless definition of custom exceptions with an explanatory comment. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
