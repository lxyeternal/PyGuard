{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for testing framework error handling, specifically for test not found and load failures.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code contains only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The comments indicate some code is copied from unittest2, but this does not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as simple custom exception definitions for a testing framework. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
