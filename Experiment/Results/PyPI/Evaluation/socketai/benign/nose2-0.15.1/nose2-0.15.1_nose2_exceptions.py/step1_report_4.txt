{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for test framework error handling",
  "sources": "None; code does not read external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform output",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; the code only defines exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. It includes a comment about code copied from unittest2, which is informational and does not influence behavior. No input, output, or external data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for test error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The mention of code copied from unittest2 is benign and does not imply any security concern.",
