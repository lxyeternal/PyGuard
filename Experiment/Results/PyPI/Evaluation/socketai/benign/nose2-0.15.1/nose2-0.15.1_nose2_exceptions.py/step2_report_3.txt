  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes (`TestNotFoundError` and `LoadTestsFailure`) and a module-level variable `__unittest`.  \n   - The code does not process any input/output, perform dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data.  \n   - The comments mention copying from unittest2, which is benign and common in testing frameworks.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n   - No report detects any obfuscated code, hidden logic, or malicious constructs.  \n   - The code is straightforward and standard for test frameworks.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Scores**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their reasoning.  \n   - They correctly dismiss any security concern, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n   - No report makes unreasonable assumptions; all conclusions are justified based on the code.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**  \n   - Since the code is simple, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate.  \n   - The confidence level of 1 in all reports is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code's purpose is solely to define exception classes, a common pattern in testing frameworks.  \n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
