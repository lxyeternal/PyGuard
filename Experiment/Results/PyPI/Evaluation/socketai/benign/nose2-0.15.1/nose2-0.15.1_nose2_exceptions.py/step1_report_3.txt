  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling test not found and load failure errors in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Code does not read input or external data; only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; code solely defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious attributes or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two custom exception classes, with no external input, data processing, or network communication. The comment indicates this code is derived from unittest2 but does not include any malicious or suspicious activity. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of custom exceptions for a testing framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
