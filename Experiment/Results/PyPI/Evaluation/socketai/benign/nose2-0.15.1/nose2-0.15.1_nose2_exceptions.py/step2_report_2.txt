  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code in question consists solely of defining two custom exception classes and a module-level variable indicating a unittest context.\n- All reports agree that there are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code.\n- The mention of copying code from unittest2 appears to be purely informational and does not introduce any security concern.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no embedded secrets, and no dynamic or external code execution.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   - The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities. It is a minimal, benign snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   - Since there is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The mention of copying from unittest2 is benign and does not imply any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is entirely benign, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary. The current scores correctly reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
