  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes and a module-level variable. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and serves as part of a testing framework.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The repeated emphasis on the benign nature aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat or risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - The mention of code copied from unittest2 is benign and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward definition of custom exception classes, with a comment about code origin.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
