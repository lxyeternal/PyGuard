{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for test framework error handling, indicating a module used in testing infrastructure.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class definitions and comments only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with benign comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module defining two exception classes and a module variable, with comments referencing unittest2. It contains no input/output, dynamic code, network activity, or secrets. The code's purpose is to serve as part of a testing framework, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard infrastructure code for exception handling in testing frameworks. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
