  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for test framework error handling.",
  "sources": "Constants (__unittest) and class definitions (TestNotFoundError, LoadTestsFailure).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines exceptions and a flag.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining exception classes related to testing. It includes a module-level variable indicating a unittest context. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign test utility snippet copied or referenced from unittest2. No indicators of obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a testing framework infrastructure.",
