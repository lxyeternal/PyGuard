  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code defines a module-level variable `__unittest = True`.\n   - It defines two custom exception classes: `TestNotFoundError` and `LoadTestsFailure`.\n   - The code includes comments indicating it was copied or developed in reference to `unittest2`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no embedded secrets.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as part of a testing framework infrastructure.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes; it does not process untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The comments about copying from `unittest2` are benign and informational.\n   - The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Reported as 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Reported as 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score**: Reported as 0, which is reasonable. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:\n   - No issues are present in the code or the reports' reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n   - The consistent high confidence (1) across reports is justified.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a standard, harmless snippet defining custom exceptions.\n   - No further risk or malware concerns are warranted.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates after review**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code, with no security concerns.",
