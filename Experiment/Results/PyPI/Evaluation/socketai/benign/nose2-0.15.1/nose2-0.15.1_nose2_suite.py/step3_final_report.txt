{
  "purpose": "The code implements a layered test suite extension for unittest, managing setup and teardown across layers with hooks, ensuring tests are run with proper layer context and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Internal attributes of 'layer', 'session', and test objects; hooks invoked during setup/teardown.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no network or file operations; method calls on trusted objects.",
  "flows": "Methods invoke hooks and classmethods on 'layer' objects during setup/teardown; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. External 'session' and 'layer' objects could be malicious if externally supplied, but this is outside the code's control.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured extension of unittest for layered testing, with hooks managing setup and teardown phases. It uses class attributes and external hooks responsibly, with exception handling to prevent crashes. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. External dependencies ('session', 'layer') could pose external risks if maliciously crafted, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. The code's logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, primarily external dependency-based.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe extension for layered test management, with no internal malicious behavior or obfuscation. External objects could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external dependencies. Overall, the code poses no internal security threat.",
