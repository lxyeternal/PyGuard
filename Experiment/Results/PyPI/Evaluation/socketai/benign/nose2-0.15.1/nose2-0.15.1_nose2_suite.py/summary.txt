  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe extension for layered test management, with no internal malicious behavior or obfuscation. External objects could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external dependencies. Overall, the code poses no internal security threat."
