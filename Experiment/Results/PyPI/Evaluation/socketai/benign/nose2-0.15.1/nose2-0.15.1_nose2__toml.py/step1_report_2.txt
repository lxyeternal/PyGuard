{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to dynamically import a TOML parsing library and provide a function to load TOML files into a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Reading the file specified by the 'file' parameter in the load_toml function.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reads a file specified by the user; however, this is standard for file I/O and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input file path from function argument -> open() -> toml.load() to parse and return data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code gracefully handles missing modules by raising an exception.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'tomllib' for Python 3.11+ or falls back to 'tomli' if not available, setting a flag accordingly. It provides a function load_toml that loads a specified file as a TOML file. The import handling is standard and appropriate. The load_toml function raises an error if the necessary library isn't available, which is normal. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is straightforward and intended solely for configuration parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for optional library importing and file parsing without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
