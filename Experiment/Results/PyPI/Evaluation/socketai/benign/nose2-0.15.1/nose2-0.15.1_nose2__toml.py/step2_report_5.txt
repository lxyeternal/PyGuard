  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code conditionally imports 'tomllib' (Python 3.11+) or 'tomli' (third-party) for parsing TOML files.\n- It provides a straightforward `load_toml` function that opens a file in binary mode and parses it.\n- The code includes proper error handling if neither library is available.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code operates solely on local files specified by the user, with no network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code behaves as described: it imports libraries dynamically, loads files, and handles missing dependencies gracefully. No anomalies or malicious code are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The logic is sound and standard. No errors or flaws are detected.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each report:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low, which aligns with the code's behavior. Security risk scores are also low (~0.1), consistent with the code's function.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5)?**  \n  The code reads files specified by an external parameter, which could be untrusted. However, since it only reads files and does not execute or transmit data, the risk is minimal. The scores reflect this.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review and recommendations:\n\n- **Are any scores unreasonable?**  \n  No. The assigned scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  While the code is benign, it could include a note that loading files from untrusted sources could pose security risks if the content is processed insecurely elsewhere. But this is outside the scope of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (the code reads files based on user input, which could be risky if misused, but the code itself is safe)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the current reports, perhaps slightly higher if considering untrusted filenames, but still very low)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation for conditional library import and TOML file loading. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
