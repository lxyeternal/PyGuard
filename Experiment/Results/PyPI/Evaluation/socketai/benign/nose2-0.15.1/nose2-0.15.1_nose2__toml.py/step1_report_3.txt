{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to conditionally import and load a TOML parsing library, enabling support for reading TOML configuration files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file specified by the 'file' argument in the 'load_toml' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_toml' function opens and reads the content of a file, passing its contents to the TOML parser. No data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow is: function load_toml receives a filename -> opens the file -> passes file stream to 'toml.load' -> returns parsed data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code includes standard conditional imports with fallbacks; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by setting a boolean flag and initializing a module variable. It attempts to import 'tomllib' (Python 3.11+), and if that fails, it tries 'tomli' (a third-party library). If both imports fail, it sets 'toml' to None and disables TOML support. The 'load_toml' function raises an error if the 'toml' module is unavailable, then reads and parses a file using the module. The logic is straightforward, with no external network access, code injection, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation for conditionally supporting TOML file parsing with fallbacks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
