{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports a TOML parsing library ('tomllib' or 'tomli') and defines a function to load a TOML file, facilitating configuration or data loading.",
  "sources": "Reading the file specified by the 'file' parameter in the load_toml function.",
  "sinks": "The file object used in open() and the toml.load() function which processes the file content.",
  "flows": "open() reads data from the specified file; toml.load() processes the file content, returning a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard dynamic imports and file reading with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. No unusual behavior or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'tomllib' (introduced in Python 3.11) or falls back to 'tomli' for older versions. It raises an error if neither library is available. The load_toml function reads a file in binary mode and parses it with the imported TOML library. The implementation is straightforward and standard for configuration loading. No malicious behavior, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code is evident. It does not interact with network, system, or sensitive data outside reading files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for loading TOML files with safe dynamic imports. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical library fallback logic and safe file handling without any malicious payload.",
