  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs conditional imports of 'tomllib' (Python 3.11+) or 'tomli' (fallback), which is standard practice.\n- The 'load_toml' function reads a filename provided as an argument, opens the file in binary mode, and loads it using the imported library.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- Error handling is straightforward: raises a RuntimeError if no suitable TOML library is available.\n- The logic is clear, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence in code:** The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It is a typical implementation for supporting multiple library versions for TOML parsing.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are evident. The fallback mechanism is correct, and error handling is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1). These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are appropriately low.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since the code only reads files and loads data with no malicious intent, malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Malware:** No malicious activity is present; malware score should remain 0.\n- **Security risk:** The minimal risk is justified, given that the filename is untrusted input, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and approximately 0.1 respectively**, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging that reading untrusted files can carry some minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk     | ~0.1              | Minimal risk due to untrusted filename input, but no issues in code logic. |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate in their assessments; no changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
