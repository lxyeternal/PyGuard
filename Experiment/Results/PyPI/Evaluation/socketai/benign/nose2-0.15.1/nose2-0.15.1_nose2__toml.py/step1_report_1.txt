{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports a TOML parsing library (either 'tomllib' or 'tomli') and provides a function to load TOML files using the available library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statements for 'tomllib' and 'tomli'. The 'load_toml' function reads a file specified by the 'file' argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_toml' function reads a file from disk specified by the 'file' argument, which could be untrusted input. The code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input source: the 'file' parameter in 'load_toml'. The flow involves opening and reading this file's contents using the imported TOML library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard library imports with fallback options and includes basic error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'tomllib' (for Python 3.11+) and falls back to 'tomli' if the first is unavailable. It sets a flag 'TOML_ENABLED' accordingly. The 'load_toml' function raises an error if neither library is available and otherwise opens and loads the specified file. The logic is straightforward, standard, and lacks any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for supporting multiple versions of a TOML parsing library with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely loads files when provided with a filename, assuming the filename is controlled by the user. There are no backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code detected.",
