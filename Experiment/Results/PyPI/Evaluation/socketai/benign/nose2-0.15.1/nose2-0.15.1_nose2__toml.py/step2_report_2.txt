  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation for conditional import of 'tomllib' or 'tomli' and provides a function `load_toml` to read and parse a specified file.\n- All reports correctly describe the code's purpose, sources, sinks, and flow.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected in the code snippets.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning and conclusions**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- They acknowledge that the code reads files specified by the user, which is typical for configuration loading.\n- The error handling for missing modules is standard and does not introduce security issues.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n**Step 3: Assess the scores assigned**\n\n- Malware scores are all 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.1), which seems reasonable given the code's function.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain of the benign assessment.\n\n**Step 4: Critical evaluation of potential issues**\n\n- The only point to consider is that `load_toml` reads files based on user input. If the filename is untrusted, there could be risks such as reading sensitive files or path traversal vulnerabilities. However, these are application-level concerns, not specific to malicious code embedded within this snippet.\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations beyond file reading, which is standard for configuration loaders.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured implementation supporting multiple library versions with fallback.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk associated with reading files specified by potentially untrusted input, but this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for its intended purpose. No adjustments to the scores are necessary based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with my assessment. The overall security posture of this code is very good, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
