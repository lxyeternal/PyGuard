{
  "purpose": "Support for conditional import of 'tomllib' or 'tomli' and loading TOML files.",
  "sources": "The filename provided to 'load_toml' function, which is opened in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Reading the specified file; no data is transmitted or executed beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "The filename input flows into 'open', then into 'toml.load' for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward import fallback and file loading logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard conditional imports of 'tomllib' or 'tomli' with fallback, then defines 'load_toml' to open and parse a user-specified file. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The only potential concern is reading files based on untrusted input, which is typical for configuration loaders but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for supporting multiple TOML parsing libraries and loading configuration files. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential risk of reading untrusted files, which is acceptable in this context.",
