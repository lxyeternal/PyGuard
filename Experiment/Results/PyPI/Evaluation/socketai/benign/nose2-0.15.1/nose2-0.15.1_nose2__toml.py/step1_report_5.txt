{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to dynamically import a TOML parsing library ('tomllib' or 'tomli') and provide a function to load a TOML file into a dictionary.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file specified by the 'file' argument in the 'load_toml' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'open' function reads data from the specified file; the loaded data is returned as a dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input: 'file' parameter -> 'open' function -> 'toml.load' -> return dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code conditionally imports libraries and raises an exception if 'toml' is unavailable; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional import of 'tomllib' or 'tomli' for parsing TOML files. It raises an error if no suitable library is available. The 'load_toml' function opens a user-specified file in binary mode and loads its contents using the imported 'toml' module. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code execution beyond standard file reading are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate configuration file parsing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for loading TOML files with conditional library import. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured piece of code aimed at supporting TOML file parsing.",
