  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package in a standard, static manner.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, external data reads, or code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary.",
