  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the module or package, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.37.17' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; only a static string assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment with no dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright statement, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no dynamic imports, external data reads, or suspicious operations. The version number appears standard and benign. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves a standard purpose in Python packages.",
