  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__` with a comment and copyright notice.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, data flow, or external dependencies are involved.\n   - No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious constructs are present.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and free of issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is a simple, standard version declaration.\n   - They correctly identify no data flow, no untrusted sources, and no malicious activity.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores: `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment, this is justified.\n   - No evidence suggests any security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`.\n   - This is correct; there's no indication of malicious activity.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are present; all assessments are based on observable, static code analysis.\n   \n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Summary and My Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hiding techniques)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.**",
