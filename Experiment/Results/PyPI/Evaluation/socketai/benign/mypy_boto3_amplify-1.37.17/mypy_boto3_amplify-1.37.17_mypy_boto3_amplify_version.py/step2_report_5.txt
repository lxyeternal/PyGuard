  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or complex logic is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `confidence` = 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**:\n   - The code is purely declarative; there are no assumptions about its safety beyond the static assignment.\n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency & Overall Assessment**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusion that this code is benign and poses no security risks is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the nature of the code, the scores are appropriate.\n- There is no need to increase any scores; the code is a standard version declaration.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a simple, static version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No changes needed. The code remains at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
