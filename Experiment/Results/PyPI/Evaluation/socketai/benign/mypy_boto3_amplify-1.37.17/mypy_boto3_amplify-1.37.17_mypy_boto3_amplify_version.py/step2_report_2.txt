  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, external data, or code execution. This is a common pattern in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n**Evaluation of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no data flows, no untrusted data, and no anomalies.\n- The scores assigned are all 1 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign, static assignment.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the code is static and straightforward, which it is.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are based on the actual code content.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Final Evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n- The reports correctly identify no issues.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are needed.",
