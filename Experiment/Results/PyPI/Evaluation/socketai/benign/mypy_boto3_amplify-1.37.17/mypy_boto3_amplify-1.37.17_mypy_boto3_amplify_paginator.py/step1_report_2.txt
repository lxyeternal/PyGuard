{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS Amplify service, facilitating type-safe pagination in Python using boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from sys, imports from standard and third-party libraries (botocore, typing_extensions), and accesses type definitions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions such as network communication, file writing, or environment manipulation.",
  "flows": "The code defines class methods that accept keyword arguments for pagination, but these are strictly for type annotations and do not execute untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines classes and types for pagination with no runtime behavior beyond class/method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a type-annotated set of paginator class definitions for the boto3 Amplify client. It imports necessary modules, defines type annotations, and includes documentation links. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. The code is standard, safe, and purely for type safety and code completion support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious type annotation module for boto3 Amplify paginators. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and serves as a static typing aid.",
