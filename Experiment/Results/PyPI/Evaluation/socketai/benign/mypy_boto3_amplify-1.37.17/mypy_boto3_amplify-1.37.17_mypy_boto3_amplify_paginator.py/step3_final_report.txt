  "purpose": "Type annotations for amplify service client paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, system info, and standard modules; static class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, untrusted input, or runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions and method signatures without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; only static, documentation-oriented code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Amplify, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or malicious behavior. It imports type definitions and system info, and defines classes with paginate methods that only specify type signatures. No data flows from untrusted sources, no code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The use of 'kwargs' is solely for type annotations, not dynamic data handling. The documentation links and class structures are standard and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS Amplify paginators, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is negligible. No modifications are necessary.",
