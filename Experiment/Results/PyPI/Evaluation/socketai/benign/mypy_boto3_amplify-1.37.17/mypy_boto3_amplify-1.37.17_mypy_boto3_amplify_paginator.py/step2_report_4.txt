  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code defines type annotations for Amplify paginators, importing static type definitions and system info. No external or untrusted input is processed.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data; the code is static and purely for type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; the code is straightforward class and method definitions with documentation links.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies this as benign, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, the code is for type annotations, importing type defs, with no external data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; only static class/method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate static typing support code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, type annotations for AWS Amplify, with imports and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external actions; only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but the code is static and safe. This may be an overestimate; the code doesn't pose any security risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Reduce \"securityRisk\" to 0, as there's no risk of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is purely for static type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Same as above, standard type annotation code.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The only minor inconsistency is in Report 3, which assigns a small security risk (0.1). Given the static, read-only nature of the code, this should be adjusted to 0.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Set to 0 across the board, as the code is purely static type annotations with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**  \nThis code is a straightforward, well-structured static type annotation module for AWS Amplify paginators, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores should reflect this, with all malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores at 0.",
