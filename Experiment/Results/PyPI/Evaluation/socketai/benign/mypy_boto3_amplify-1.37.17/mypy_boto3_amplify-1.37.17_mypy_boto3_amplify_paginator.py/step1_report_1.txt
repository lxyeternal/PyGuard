{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS Amplify service client, enabling type-safe pagination over various API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions imported from 'type_defs' and system information from 'sys'. It does not process external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class inheritance and method signatures for paginator classes, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow; 'paginate' methods accept keyword arguments based on type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type annotation setup with no suspicious or unusual logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes and methods for type annotations related to AWS SDK paginators, importing type definitions, and handling Python version compatibility. There is no code execution, external data processing, or system manipulation. The use of 'Unpack' for type annotations is conditional and standard for version compatibility. No indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior are detected. The structure aligns with standard type hinting practices and documentation comments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for AWS Amplify paginators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
