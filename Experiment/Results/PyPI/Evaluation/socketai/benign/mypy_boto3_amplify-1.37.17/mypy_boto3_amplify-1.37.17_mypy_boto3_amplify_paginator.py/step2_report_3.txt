  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Amplify.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: All static, no untrusted data, no runtime actions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: The code is purely for static type annotations, with no dynamic behavior or external data handling.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe, and standard.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations for boto3 stubs.\n- No external data or runtime actions.\n- Safe and legitimate.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, with focus on type safety and static class definitions.\n- No suspicious activity or code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, just static typing)  \n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous, no dynamic code or external data.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, static type annotations, no runtime or external data.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code content:** All reports describe static, type annotation code for AWS SDK paginators.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; code does not execute, connect, or process untrusted data.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Virtually none; only static type annotations and class definitions.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for the very low, non-executable type annotations)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for boto3 AWS Amplify paginators. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The reported scores are reasonable, but I would suggest setting the overall risk score to **0** instead of 0.1, as there is no actual security concern.\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set risk score to 0, reflecting the code's benign nature.",
