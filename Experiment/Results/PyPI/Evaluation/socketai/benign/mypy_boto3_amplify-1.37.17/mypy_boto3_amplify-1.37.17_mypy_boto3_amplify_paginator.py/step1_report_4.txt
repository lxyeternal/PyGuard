  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS Amplify service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. No user input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods that accept dynamic **kwargs and return PageIterator objects. No untrusted data used for sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines classes and methods with fixed structure and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code appears standard and focused on type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators for the Amplify service with proper type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and clear class structures. No suspicious data handling, external code execution, or malicious constructs are present. All parts are consistent with standard boto3 stub generation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for AWS Amplify paginators. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected. It solely provides type hints for pagination classes.",
