  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS Amplify service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs of various request types; no untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input **kwargs flow into 'paginate' methods, which pass them to the underlying Paginator class; no sensitive data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; all classes and methods follow standard boto3-stubs pattern. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators for AWS Amplify, with type annotations ensuring safe API call patterns. The conditional imports and class structures are standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. All functions and imports appear to be for legitimate SDK support, with no network or system modifications, credential handling, or external code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type-annotated paginator classes for AWS Amplify SDK. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be purely for type-safe API access with no harmful intent.",
