{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Amplify service client to facilitate paginated API calls with type safety in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions imported from 'type_defs' module and system version info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; the code only defines classes and type annotations.",
  "flows": "The paginator classes use type annotations to facilitate type-safe method calls, with no data flow involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs; the code contains standard type annotations, conditional imports, and class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines typed paginator classes for the boto3 Amplify client, with conditional imports for compatibility. It uses standard Python typing constructs, class inheritance, and method signatures with type annotations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a well-structured, documentation-focused module designed for type safety and improved developer experience.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate type annotation and class definition module for boto3 Amplify paginators. It contains no signs of malware or malicious intent, serving only as a typing aid. Security risks are negligible, and there is no suspicious activity detected.",
