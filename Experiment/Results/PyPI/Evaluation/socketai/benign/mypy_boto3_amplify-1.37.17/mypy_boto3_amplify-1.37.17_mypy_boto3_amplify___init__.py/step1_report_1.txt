{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the amplify service, exposing client and paginator classes for use by other modules or users.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The copyright date is set in the future (2025), which may be a typo but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via module-level variables and __all__. It contains only straightforward class and variable assignments and documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, or data manipulations. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, but that is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger SDK or library setup.",
