  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static module that imports classes and re-exports them, serving as an SDK interface.\n- No external data, user input, or network operations are involved.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious or vulnerable constructs.\n   - It is purely an interface module with no dynamic or risky behavior.\n   - The reports correctly identify this as benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reasoning is sound; the code is simple and static.\n   - No errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9+), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is benign, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly assign low or zero scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity, backdoors, or code injections are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\n\nThis code is a static, well-structured module that only imports and re-exports classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The future copyright year is likely a typo, not an indicator of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimate | Reasoning                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present      |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky patterns present        |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and I concur with their assessments. The code is benign, with no security issues.",
