{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for interacting with the AWS Amplify service via boto3, including importing relevant classes and setting up type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; code primarily defines class aliases and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only class imports and alias assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The license year is set to 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an interface layer, importing classes from local modules and defining exports. It includes a detailed docstring with example usage and documentation links. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module intended for facilitating AWS Amplify service interactions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.",
