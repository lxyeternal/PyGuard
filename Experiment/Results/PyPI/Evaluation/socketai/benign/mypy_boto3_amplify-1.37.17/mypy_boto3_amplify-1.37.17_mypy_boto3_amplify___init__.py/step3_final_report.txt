{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS Amplify service by importing and re-exporting client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports classes from local modules and defines an export interface. It contains no dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The only atypical aspect is the future copyright year, which does not affect security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo. Overall, it is safe and appropriate to assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
