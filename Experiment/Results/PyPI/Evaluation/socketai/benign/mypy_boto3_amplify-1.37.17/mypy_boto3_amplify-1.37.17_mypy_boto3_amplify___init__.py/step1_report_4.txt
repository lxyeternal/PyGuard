{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with the AWS Amplify service through boto3, including documentation and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines class and variable aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or system command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is mainly re-exporting classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from internal modules, defines a class alias, and sets up an __all__ export list. It includes documentation with example usage. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or credential handling. The structure aligns with standard Python module practices for SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard SDK interface file that re-exports classes and functions for AWS Amplify integration. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is safe for use.",
