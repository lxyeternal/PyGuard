{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Amplify service, providing methods to interact with Amplify resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class property and method parameters; docstrings describing API calls.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (unpacked request types), return statements, property getters, and dynamic method creation via overloads.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (kwargs unpacked into request types) flow into API calls; return values flow from API responses back to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Use of overloads for paginators is standard; no obfuscation or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK client wrapper with type annotations for the AWS Amplify service. It relies heavily on external SDK conventions and type definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The methods are primarily for API interaction, with parameters and return types properly annotated. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The import statements and class structure are typical for SDKs and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Amplify, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It solely provides typed method signatures for interacting with AWS services, consistent with open-source SDK patterns.",
