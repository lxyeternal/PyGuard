  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Amplify SDK, providing method signatures, exception classes, and documentation links for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from kwargs into API request types, class properties, and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "API request methods that send data to AWS services; generate_presigned_url creates URLs that could be misused if mishandled.",
  "flows": "User code calls methods with kwargs, which are unpacked into API requests; generate_presigned_url produces URLs for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard SDK patterns with extensive type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, static SDK wrapper with type annotations, method signatures, and exception classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The presence of URL signing via generate_presigned_url is standard AWS SDK functionality and does not indicate malicious intent. The low risk scores (around 0.1) are appropriate given the nature of the code, which interacts with external services but does not execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-typed SDK interface for AWS Amplify with no malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and standard usage pattern.",
