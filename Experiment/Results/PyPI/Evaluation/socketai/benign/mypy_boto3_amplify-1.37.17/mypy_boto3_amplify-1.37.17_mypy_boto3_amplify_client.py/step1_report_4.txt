  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS Amplify service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Constant import statements, class property methods, and function definitions using unpacked request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from user-provided kwargs (input data) to API call methods, but no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval.",
  "flows": "kwargs unpacked into API request calls, with no evident data leakage, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is standard for boto3 client interface with type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typed client class for AWS Amplify with methods corresponding to AWS API calls, utilizing type annotations for safety and clarity. It imports necessary modules and defines exception classes. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious logic. The methods are purely interface definitions, adhering to boto3 standards. The import statements are safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code structure is straightforward and focused on type annotations and method signatures. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard interface wrapper for AWS Amplify with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses proper type annotations for safety. The overall security risk is negligible.",
