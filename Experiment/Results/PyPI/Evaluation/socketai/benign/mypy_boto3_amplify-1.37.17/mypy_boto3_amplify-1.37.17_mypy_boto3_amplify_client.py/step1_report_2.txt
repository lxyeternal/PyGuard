{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface for the AWS Amplify service client, facilitating type-checked API calls within Python applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and local modules for paginator and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; methods are primarily API wrappers with no execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions, intended for API request construction, with no direct execution of untrusted code or data flow analysis indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type annotations, overloads for paginator creation, and documentation links; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a typed interface for AWS Amplify API interactions, primarily defining method signatures, properties, and exception types. There is no dynamic execution, input evaluation, or suspicious logic. The focus is on type safety and API documentation, with no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The structure aligns with standard boto3-stub implementation patterns, emphasizing safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured type annotation interface for AWS Amplify client operations, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as a static typing aid without executing or processing untrusted data.",
