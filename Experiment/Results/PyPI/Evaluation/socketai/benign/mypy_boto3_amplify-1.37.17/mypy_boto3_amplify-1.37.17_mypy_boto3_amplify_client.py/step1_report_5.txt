  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for AWS Amplify service, providing structured access to AWS Amplify API operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class attributes; method parameters, especially kwargs unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "generate_presigned_url method (potential URL generation), various API methods that accept kwargs, methods returning or handling untrusted data, paginator creation methods.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into method parameters via **kwargs, which are unpacked from specific type definitions; generate_presigned_url creates a URL; methods return data or perform actions based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded URLs; no obfuscated code patterns; no unusual dynamic code execution; standard use of type hints and method signatures; typical paginator overloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Amplify, with methods wrapping AWS SDK operations, including URL generation, resource management, and pagination. All inputs are via well-typed kwargs, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscated logic. The generate_presigned_url method is a potential concern if misused, but it is standard for AWS clients. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate type-annotated client wrapper for AWS Amplify, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard patterns and safe practices, with clear documentation and type hints. No evidence of malware or security risks.",
