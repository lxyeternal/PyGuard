  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for the AWS Amplify service in boto3, providing type hints and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class definitions; method definitions with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS services via boto3 client, including URL generation, resource management, and pagination.",
  "flows": "User code interacts with the AmplifyClient methods, which internally invoke AWS API calls, potentially transmitting data to AWS endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code mainly consists of method signatures, type annotations, and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, well-typed wrapper for the boto3 Amplify client, including exception handling, method signatures for AWS API calls, and pagination support. It uses standard library and botocore modules, with no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or hidden backdoors. The import of local modules for paginator and type definitions appears normal. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or system modifications beyond AWS API interactions. Overall, it looks like a typical SDK wrapper with extensive type hints, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured type annotation and wrapper implementation for the boto3 Amplify client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It mainly provides interface definitions and method signatures for interacting with AWS Amplify services. Confidence is high that this code is safe and intended for SDK purposes.",
