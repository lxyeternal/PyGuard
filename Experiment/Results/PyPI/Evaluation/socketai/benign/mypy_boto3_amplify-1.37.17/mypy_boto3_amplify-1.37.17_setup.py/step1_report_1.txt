{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-amplify', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, and gathers package metadata and dependencies from static variables and import statements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to write or execute untrusted data; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily loads static data and passes it to the setup() function without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, static, and typical for a setup script. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads static content for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It performs no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data manipulation beyond static data handling. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The package appears safe based on the provided code.",
