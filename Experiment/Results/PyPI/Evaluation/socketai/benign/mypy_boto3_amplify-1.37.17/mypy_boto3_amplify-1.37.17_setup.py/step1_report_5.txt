{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'mypy-boto3-amplify' used for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long_description, imports setup from setuptools, reads environment variables via Python standard library, and uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external locations, executes untrusted data, or interacts with network/system resources in a malicious way.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> assigns to variable -> passes data to setup() function; no untrusted data flow or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard Python setup script with straightforward package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup: reading a markdown file for description, importing setup, and calling setup() with package info. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used in a way that could lead to malicious activity. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious imports, or dangerous commands. All dependencies are specified explicitly and safely.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
