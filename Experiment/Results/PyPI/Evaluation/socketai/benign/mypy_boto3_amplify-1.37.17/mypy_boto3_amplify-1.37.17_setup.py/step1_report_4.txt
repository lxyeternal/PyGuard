{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-amplify' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md' to read the long description; setup() parameters providing package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities; setup parameters are static or derived locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard libraries and defines package metadata for setuptools. It reads a README file for the description and passes a static configuration to setup(). All values are hardcoded or derived from local files without any external input or dynamic execution. There are no indications of malicious intent, code injection, or data leakage. The code follows standard setup practices without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
