{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading static files and calling setup() with fixed metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing from pathlib and setuptools, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no external data inputs.",
  "flows": "Static data passed directly to setup(), no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward, static setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All package metadata and file reads are safe and standard. No code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Multiple independent reviews confirm its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The only minor discrepancy is a security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is unwarranted given the code's static and safe nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate; the slight overestimation of risk in one report should be corrected to zero. The package poses no security concerns.",
