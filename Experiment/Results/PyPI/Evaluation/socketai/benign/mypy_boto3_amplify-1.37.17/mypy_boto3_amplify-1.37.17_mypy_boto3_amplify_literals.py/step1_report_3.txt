  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Amplify service and related AWS resource identifiers to enable type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals used to define type annotations for various AWS service identifiers and resource names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or user input, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code purely defines constants for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for AWS services and resources. The definitions are static, extensive, and serve as type hints for static analysis or IDE support. No user input, external data, or potentially malicious code appears to be processed. No external dependencies or network calls are involved. The purpose is purely to support type safety and documentation for AWS-related code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type annotations defining AWS resource and service name literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as type hinting aids without executing any dynamic or potentially harmful code.",
