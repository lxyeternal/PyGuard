  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS Amplify and other AWS service-related string constants, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for various AWS service names, resource types, statuses, and other enumerations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted data inputs; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code consists solely of type annotations and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and string literal definitions for various AWS-related enumerations to support type safety and code readability. It includes conditional import logic based on Python version, which is standard and safe. No external input handling, network activity, or file operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious constructs. The scope is limited to defining constants and types, typical for SDK or API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that defines type literals for AWS services. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for type annotation purposes, with no indications of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
