  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Amplify service configuration and related enums for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string constants used throughout AWS SDK for Python (boto3) type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; the code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all definitions are static string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the import conditional for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a set of string literal types for use in type annotations, including service names, region names, and other enums. It imports 'Literal' conditionally, which is a common compatibility pattern for different Python versions. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The entire script appears to be a static, declarative module intended for type hinting and code clarity. No potential malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static declaration of string literal types for AWS SDK type annotations. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no data leakage, and no signs of sabotage. The only notable feature is the compatibility check for the 'Literal' type, which is standard. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
