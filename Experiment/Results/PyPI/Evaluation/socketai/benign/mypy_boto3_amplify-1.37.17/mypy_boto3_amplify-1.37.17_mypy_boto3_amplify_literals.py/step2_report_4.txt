  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores align with the findings, and if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code solely consists of static string literal definitions for AWS service names, resource types, statuses, and related enums.\n- It includes a conditional import for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The purpose is clearly for static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS Amplify and other AWS service string literals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; straightforward constants.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence, malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, defining AWS resource and service literals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—static string literals for AWS types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS constants for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, only static definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports correctly identify the code as purely static type annotations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** None; the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, the code is a benign module providing static type annotations for AWS SDK constants. There are no signs of supply chain threats, malicious code, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a safe, static declaration of string literals for AWS SDK type annotations, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
