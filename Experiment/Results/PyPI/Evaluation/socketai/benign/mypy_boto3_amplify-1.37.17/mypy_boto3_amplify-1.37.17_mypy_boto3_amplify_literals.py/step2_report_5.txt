  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a set of static type annotations defining string literals for AWS services, resource types, statuses, etc.\n- The code includes conditional imports of `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No external data sources, user input, network activity, or file operations are involved.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is solely to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.\n- The confidence level across reports is high (1), and all agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines string literal types and uses conditional imports appropriately.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Supply chain risk:** No external dependencies or dynamic code, only static definitions.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Given the absence of any malicious patterns, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code is purely for type annotations, with no external inputs or outputs, and no security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n\n- All scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, static type declaration module for AWS service literals.**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThere are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain threats, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a purely static purpose for type hinting.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is a standard practice in SDK or API client libraries for static type checking support.",
