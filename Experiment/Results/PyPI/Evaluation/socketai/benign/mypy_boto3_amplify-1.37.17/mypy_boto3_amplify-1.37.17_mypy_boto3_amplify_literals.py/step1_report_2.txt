{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for AWS Amplify service literals using Python's typing system, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from predefined string literals assigned to type aliases, primarily in the form of string constants within Literal types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input, write data, or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks exists; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines string literals and conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then declares numerous string literal type aliases for various AWS Amplify and AWS resource identifiers. The literals are straightforward, human-readable, and do not perform any dynamic or runtime operations. No data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs. The structure is purely for static type annotation purposes, with no apparent malicious intent or obfuscation. There are no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign module defining type annotations for AWS Amplify service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for type hinting and conditional imports based on Python version. The code appears safe and solely intended for improving static code analysis and developer documentation.",
