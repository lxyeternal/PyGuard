{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Amplify and related service constants using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; import of 'sys' for version check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines various string literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, statuses, etc. All definitions are static and straightforward. No input handling, no data processing, no external communication, no code that can be manipulated at runtime for malicious purposes. The purpose appears solely to provide type annotations for better static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely defines type aliases for AWS service constants. There is no malicious behavior, no backdoors, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic present.",
