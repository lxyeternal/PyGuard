{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS services, resource identifiers, statuses, and related enums to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; code contains no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type annotations with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining numerous string literal types for AWS SDK constants, with conditional import for 'Literal' to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It contains no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely for static type annotations and documentation support, making it inherently safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of AWS-related string literal types, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
