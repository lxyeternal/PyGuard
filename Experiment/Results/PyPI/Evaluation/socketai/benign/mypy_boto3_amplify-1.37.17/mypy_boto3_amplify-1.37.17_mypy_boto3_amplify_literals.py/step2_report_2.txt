  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, resource names, statuses, and related constants.\n- It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is purely for type annotations and documentation support.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define Python type literals for AWS Amplify and other AWS services.\n- Findings: No external data, no anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, purely for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Provide type annotations for AWS Amplify literals.\n- Findings: No external input, no anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe and standard.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define string literal types for AWS Amplify and related identifiers.\n- Findings: Static literals, no dynamic code, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe for static analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for AWS Amplify and related services.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no anomalies, standard import pattern.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, purely static.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Declare string literals for AWS SDK type annotations.\n- Findings: No dynamic code, no data flow, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign static declarations.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious Indicators\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or secret handling.\n- **Security Risks:** Zero; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as no runtime logic or external inputs are processed.\n\n### Scores Justification\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the static, read-only nature and absence of external interactions.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants. There are no signs of supply chain threats, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, static declaration of AWS-related string literal types intended for type checking and documentation. No malicious or security-compromising elements are present.",
