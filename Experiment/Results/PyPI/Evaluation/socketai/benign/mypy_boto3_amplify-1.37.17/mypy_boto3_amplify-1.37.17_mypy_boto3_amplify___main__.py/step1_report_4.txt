  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package, including version details and package info.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine behavior.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Checks if '--version' is in command-line arguments; if so, outputs version info; otherwise, outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward control flow; no external data sources or sinks that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and static, serving only to display information based on CLI input. It uses standard library functions without any external or dynamic input processing that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, no network activity, no credential handling, and no data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
