  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information, sys.argv for input detection.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise calls print_info() which outputs detailed package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward informational output with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a command-line utility to display package information and version details. It only reads command-line arguments and outputs static strings to stdout. There are no external network calls, no handling of untrusted input beyond simple argument checking, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The logic is simple and intended for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. Its purpose is benign and straightforward.",
