{
  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data or sensitive information handled.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to calling `print_version()`, otherwise `print_info()` outputs static info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted data. The logic is simple, with no suspicious features, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's structure and static nature support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
