  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.\n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- All functions perform straightforward print operations of hardcoded strings.\n- No credentials, secrets, or data leakage mechanisms are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described behavior. No discrepancies are noted.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws:** None identified. The code is simple and does not perform any risky operations.\n- **Reporting inaccuracies:** No flaws or mistakes in the reports' reasoning are apparent.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Confidence:** All reports show 1, indicating high confidence in their assessment.\n\n### Risk Scores Justification:\n- Since the code is purely informational with no dynamic or malicious elements, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The **malware score** should also remain at **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains at **0** due to the code's clarity.\n\n### Any assumptions or claims?\n- All reports correctly assume the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- No claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the script.",
