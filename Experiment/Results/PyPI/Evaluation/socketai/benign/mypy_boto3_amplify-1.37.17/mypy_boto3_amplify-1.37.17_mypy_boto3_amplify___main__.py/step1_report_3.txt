  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that provides information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command line arguments), sys.stdout (for output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (printing information to stdout)",
  "flows": "Input: command line argument '--version' (source) -> print_version (sink), or no argument -> print_info (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The output is informational. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two informational functions, print_info and print_version, which output static package information. The main function processes command line arguments, displaying version info if '--version' is present, otherwise showing package details. The script is straightforward and does not perform any data manipulation, network access, or insecure operations. It solely outputs predefined static information. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The code is simple and serves as an entry point with no external dependencies or suspicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign CLI interface providing package info. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a standard informational script with no suspicious features.",
