  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely static type definitions for an SDK, with no runtime logic or data handling. It notes the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is benign and purely declarative is justified. The confidence level of 1 is appropriate.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report similarly confirms that the code is static type annotations for the AWS Amplify SDK, with no runtime or external data handling. It emphasizes the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that it is safe and benign is justified. Confidence is 1.0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the report notes the code consists of TypedDict classes, conditional imports, and no runtime logic or external data handling. It states the code is standard for type annotations, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is benign and solely for static type purposes is justified. Confidence=1.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states that the code provides detailed type definitions without runtime logic, network activity, or obfuscation. It confirms the code is solely for static type annotations.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The benign nature is well-supported, with confidence=1.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Error:** The report indicates an \"Empty response\" with no further details.  \n- **Implication:** Without any content, no assessment can be made. It’s likely a failed or incomplete report.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code content:** Pure static type definitions for an SDK, with no runtime or network activity.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risk:** None detected across all detailed reports.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, static type annotation module for AWS Amplify SDK in Python.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is entirely benign, serving as a static type schema for SDK development. No security concerns are identified.",
