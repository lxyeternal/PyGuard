  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the Amplify service SDK in Python, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and internal type definitions; no runtime data input/output sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code is purely type definition with no data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data pathways; this is static type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward type definitions with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for the Amplify SDK, using TypedDict, Union, and NotRequired to define data structures. It imports necessary modules and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No executable code, data processing, or external communication exists. The code strictly adheres to static type definition patterns with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. There are no functions executing code, no network operations, no credential handling, and no obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for SDK use, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is purely declarative and type-safe, serving as a foundation for type checking in the SDK. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
