{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the amplify service API in Python, providing structured data schemas for various API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals modules, system version info checks, and the code itself defining TypedDicts and data structures.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code is purely data structure definitions without dynamic execution, data handling, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within these definitions; they serve as static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are present. No runtime code, evaluation logic, or external data reads are included.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version. It includes no runtime logic, data handling, or external network interactions. All data structures are well-formed, with clear separation of request/response schemas. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotations for SDKs or API integrations, with no hidden or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for an SDK or API client, with no malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks identified. It is purely declarative and intended for type safety.",
