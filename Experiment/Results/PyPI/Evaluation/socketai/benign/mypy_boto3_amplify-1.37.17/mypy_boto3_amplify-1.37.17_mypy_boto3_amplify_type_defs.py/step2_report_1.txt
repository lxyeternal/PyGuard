  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, data flow, anomalies, and conclusions.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The report states that the code consists solely of static type definitions for the AWS Amplify SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network interactions. It notes proper use of TypedDict, conditional imports, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations. No suspicious activity or security risks are evident.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are rightly 0. Risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a comprehensive set of type annotations, with no runtime data processing or external communication. It highlights proper use of Python typing and no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static type definitions, serving as a foundation for type safety.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code provides data structures for the SDK, with no data flow beyond type annotations, no dynamic code, and no malicious features. It emphasizes the use of standard practices for compatibility and type hinting.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely for static type checking, with no runtime or network activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, appropriate for such static schema code.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming that the code is static type definitions for the SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network interactions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a schema for type safety and documentation.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** States \"Empty response\" with no further details.  \n- **Assessment:** No information provided; cannot evaluate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is static type definitions, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the static, schema-like nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, consistent with the lack of dynamic or network code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign, well-structured, and serves solely as type annotations for SDKs or API clients.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions with no malicious or security concerns.",
