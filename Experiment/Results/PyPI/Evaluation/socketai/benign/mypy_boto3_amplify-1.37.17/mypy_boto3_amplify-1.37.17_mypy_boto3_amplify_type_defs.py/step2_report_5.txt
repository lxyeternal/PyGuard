  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms that the code is solely static type definitions for an SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network interactions. No anomalies or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report states the code is benign, well-structured, and purely declarative, with a confidence of 1. No malware or security risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** This is accurate. The code is standard type annotations for an SDK, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type annotations, imports, and data schemas without runtime or external data handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as safe and purely declarative, with full confidence and no malware.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for SDK use.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms the code is static data structure definitions, with no runtime logic or external data processing. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code is benign, serving as type annotations and data models for AWS Amplify SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the static nature of the code, with no dynamic or unsafe data handling. No anomalies or malicious features.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code is a benign schema for type safety, with no malware or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Error:** The report indicates an \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- **Assessment:** No meaningful analysis can be made due to lack of data.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or runtime logic.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected; the code is standard for SDK type annotations.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward type definitions)\n  - **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n### My Own Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, well-structured, and no malicious or suspicious elements present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, purely declarative set of type annotations for an SDK, with no security concerns.",
