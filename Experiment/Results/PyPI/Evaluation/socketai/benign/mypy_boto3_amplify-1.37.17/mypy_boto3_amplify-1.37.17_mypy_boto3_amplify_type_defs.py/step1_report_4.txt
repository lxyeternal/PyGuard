{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the AWS Amplify service SDK, providing structured data types for request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, class definitions, and variable assignments within the module.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization/deserialization points, such as returning data structures or accepting input parameters; no unsafe sinks involving untrusted data handling or network transmission found.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within type definitions and annotations, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. The structure mainly defines data formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Usage of future imports, conditional imports for compatibility, and extensive type annotations are standard for type hinting and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed TypedDict classes for AWS Amplify SDK data structures, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. There is no runtime logic, code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond type definitions. No obfuscated or malicious code features are present. The code appears to serve as a static type schema for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Amplify, designed solely for static type annotations and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, structured schema code for SDK typings.",
