{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the AWS Amplify service in Python, facilitating type annotations and API response modeling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; class and variable definitions with type annotations and default values.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data is being sent over the network, executed dynamically, or written to files.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines data structures, not runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and type aliasing. It imports standard modules and local literals, then defines structured data types for API requests and responses related to AWS Amplify. The structure is consistent with standard type definition practices, with no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden code, or obfuscation. The code is static, well-structured, and designed solely for type safety and data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python SDK related to AWS Amplify. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
