  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states that the code consists solely of static type definitions for the Amplify SDK, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious anomalies are detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default low risk for type definitions). The report's conclusion aligns with this assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations without runtime data handling.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No untrusted data flow or anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard type definitions, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (again, standard for static type definitions). The conclusion is consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS Amplify SDK.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, well-structured, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, purely for static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with no content.\n- **Implication:** No data to analyze; cannot determine any risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** This is just an absence of data, not an indication of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is purely static type definitions for the AWS Amplify SDK.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** The default low risk score (around 0.5) for static type definitions is appropriate. No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as the code is straightforward type annotations.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern given the static nature.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, well-formed set of static type definitions for an SDK.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5) is reasonable, but for more precision, I suggest:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (since it's purely static type info, the risk is negligible)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no further action is necessary.",
