{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for the AWS Amplify SDK, serving as type annotations and data schemas without runtime logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations within class definitions, import statements for type compatibility, and constants defining data structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static type definitions with no runtime or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic execution; the code is declarative and serves solely for type checking.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of runtime code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, and constant definitions for data schemas. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The structure adheres to standard Python typing practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking for SDK users, ensuring type safety and clarity. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of static type definitions for the AWS Amplify SDK, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports its safety and purpose as a schema for type annotations.",
