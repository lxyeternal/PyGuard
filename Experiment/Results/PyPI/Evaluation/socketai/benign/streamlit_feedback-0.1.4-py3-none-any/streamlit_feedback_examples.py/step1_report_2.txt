{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of Streamlit applications integrating OpenAI's API for chat and text completion functionalities, including user feedback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads OpenAI API key from st.secrets and user input; reads user prompts from chat input or text areas; retrieves feedback input via streamlit_feedback function.",
  "sinks": "Uses openai.ChatCompletion.create and openai.Completion.create for API calls; writes responses and feedback to the Streamlit interface; updates API key in openai.api_key.",
  "flows": "User input collected via chat or text area flows into OpenAI API calls; responses are displayed and stored in session state; feedback input flows from UI back to _submit_feedback function, which updates metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials besides API key retrieved from secrets; feedback handling updates user response with metadata; API key is set directly from user input, but no hardcoded secrets or backdoors found; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation; use of deprecated or insecure API endpoints not present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily integrates OpenAI API calls with a Streamlit interface, with feedback collection mechanisms. API keys are retrieved from st.secrets and user input, which is standard practice. Feedback functions update response metadata but do not perform malicious actions. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. All code appears to be standard application code for UI and API interaction. The code does not contain suspicious code injection, data leaks, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code is a typical frontend interface for OpenAI models with user feedback and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for user interaction with OpenAI models via Streamlit, with feedback capabilities. No malicious or sabotage behavior identified. The security risk is minimal, primarily concerning proper handling of API keys which appears to be correctly managed via st.secrets.",
