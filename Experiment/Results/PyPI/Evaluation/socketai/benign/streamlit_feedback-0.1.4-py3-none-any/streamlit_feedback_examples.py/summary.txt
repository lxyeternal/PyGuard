  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Streamlit app integrating OpenAI APIs with feedback collection. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily related to API key handling which appears secure."
