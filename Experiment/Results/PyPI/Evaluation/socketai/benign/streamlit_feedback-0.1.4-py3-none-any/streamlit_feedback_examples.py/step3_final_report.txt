{
  "purpose": "The code provides multiple Streamlit applications for interacting with OpenAI models, handling user input, API keys, and feedback collection.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, secrets storage for API keys, session state for message and response management.",
  "sinks": "OpenAI API calls, UI components displaying responses and feedback, session state updates.",
  "flows": "User input → API key retrieval → API request → Response handling → Feedback collection and UI updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Feedback callbacks are standard UI elements. No suspicious network activity or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Streamlit frontend for OpenAI models, with feedback mechanisms. It handles API keys securely via secrets, makes API calls based on user input, and displays responses. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The feedback functions are UI-only, and the API interactions are standard. The code structure is clear, and no suspicious data flows or code anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Streamlit app integrating OpenAI APIs with feedback collection. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily related to API key handling which appears secure.",
