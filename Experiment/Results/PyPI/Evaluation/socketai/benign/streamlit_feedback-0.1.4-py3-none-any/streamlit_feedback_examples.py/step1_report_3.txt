{
  "purpose": "The code implements multiple Streamlit-based web applications for interacting with OpenAI language models, including chatbots and feedback collection components.",
  "sources": "Reads OpenAI API key from st.secrets and user input; reads user prompts and feedback input; accesses environment variables through st.secrets; retrieves responses from OpenAI APIs.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API key to send requests to OpenAI's services; displays responses and feedback within the Streamlit interface.",
  "flows": "User inputs prompt and feedback -> stored in session state -> API key used to authenticate request -> requests sent to OpenAI API -> responses displayed and feedback submitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of st.secrets for API key management. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. Feedback components are used for collecting user input without any suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages user interaction with OpenAI models via Streamlit interface, securely fetching API keys from st.secrets. API calls are straightforward, with responses processed and displayed within the app. Feedback collection is implemented using provided components. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption. The code adheres to standard patterns for integrating OpenAI with Streamlit, with no suspicious or anomalous code segments identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of demo applications for interacting with OpenAI models and collecting feedback, with no malicious intent detected. It securely manages API keys and follows typical usage patterns. Overall, the code poses no security threats or malicious behaviors.",
