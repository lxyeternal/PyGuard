{
  "purpose": "This code provides several Streamlit-based web applications for interacting with OpenAI language models, including chatbots and feedback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user input fields (API keys, prompts), session state variables, and secrets management; data flows through API calls to OpenAI services and internal state updates.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach OpenAI API calls, session state variables, or output display components, potentially causing unintended data exposure or API misuse.",
  "flows": "User inputs (API keys, prompts) are read from interface elements and session state; these data are used to call OpenAI API endpoints; responses are stored and displayed, with feedback submitted via callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible; no suspicious network calls are present; no obfuscated code features; feedback functions appear standard but are called repeatedly with dynamic keys, which could be misused to overload state.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes API keys from user input and secrets, then interacts with OpenAI models through standard API calls. The feedback functions are integrated for collecting user input but do not transmit data externally aside from typical callbacks. The code appears to implement typical chat and feedback functionality with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is detected. The session state management seems standard, and the API usage follows documented patterns. Overall, the code maintains standard application logic without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a typical Streamlit interface for interacting with OpenAI APIs, with integrated user feedback components. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage is found. The security risk is minimal, assuming proper management of secrets and API keys. The code is safe for use, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
