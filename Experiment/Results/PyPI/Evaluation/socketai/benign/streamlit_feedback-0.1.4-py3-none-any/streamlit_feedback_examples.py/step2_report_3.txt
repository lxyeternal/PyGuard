  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears to be standard, user-facing, with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No significant logical flaws identified. Slight concern about reuse of 'key' parameters, but this is typical in Streamlit.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. The low security risk reflects typical app concerns about API key handling.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is standard for API interaction with OpenAI.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic or vulnerabilities. Feedback handling is UI-based.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just API calls and user input handling.\n- **Overall:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, similar to above, straightforward API integration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No vulnerabilities or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 are suitable.\n- **Justification:** Minimal security risk, mainly about proper API key management.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, standard pattern for API calls, session state, feedback.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, typical API and feedback handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Same as above, minimal security concerns.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. No malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as no obfuscated code is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns primarily around API key handling, which is managed via secrets and user input.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard app security considerations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's nature. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and the security risk is minimal.",
