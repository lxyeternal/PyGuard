{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit component for user feedback collection, supporting thumbs or face-based feedback, with optional textual input and callback handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, file paths for the build directory, session state variables, and parameters passed to the 'streamlit_feedback' function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'on_submit' callback, which may process feedback data, and the file system via 'os.path' operations. No direct network operations or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to 'streamlit_feedback' flow into component configuration; user responses are captured via '_component_func' and stored in 'st.session_state'; if a callback is provided, feedback is passed to it, completing the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or obfuscated code detected. The 'try-except' block for importing 'examples' suggests a development aid but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Streamlit feedback component with configurable options, validating input parameters and managing state via Streamlit's session. It conditionally loads the component for development or production environments. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic. The only potential concern is the use of local URLs during development, which is typical for testing. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a user feedback component for Streamlit applications. It performs input validation, manages state, and integrates a frontend component. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
