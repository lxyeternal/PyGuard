{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Streamlit component for collecting user feedback, supporting different feedback types and optional callback handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables (via os.path and st.session_state), function parameters, and user interactions within the Streamlit app.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the callback function 'on_submit' that processes feedback, and the component communication with the frontend via _component_func, which could handle untrusted data if misused.",
  "flows": "User interacts with the Streamlit UI, which triggers _component_func to gather feedback. Feedback data flows from frontend to backend, possibly invoking 'on_submit' callback, and updates session state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code includes standard error handling for user input validation and distinguishes development from production modes. No obfuscated code or malicious external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages environment-specific behavior with _RELEASE, and validates input parameters to prevent misuse. It defines a feedback component with parameters for feedback type and optional callbacks. Session state management is standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors are observed. External dependencies appear limited to standard libraries and the Streamlit package. The code is straightforward, with clear parameter validation and control flow, and no suspicious or anomalous constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a benign implementation of a Streamlit feedback component, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for UI interaction and callback handling without exposing security vulnerabilities.",
