  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a feedback component, noting environment variables and session state.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; data flows within session and callbacks.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The review correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malware or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, emphasizing user inputs and environment setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through callback functions and session state, no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as standard, with proper validation and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code supports feedback types, reads environment variables, and session state.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback passes through callbacks and session state; no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Validates the code as standard, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar observations; the code manages environment-specific component loading.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback data flows internally; no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard for a Streamlit component.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable given the context.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's functionality and data sources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback data flows through callbacks and session state; no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a standard, safe implementation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nThe code appears entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to environment-specific configuration and callback handling, which are standard practices.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Streamlit feedback component with no security concerns.",
