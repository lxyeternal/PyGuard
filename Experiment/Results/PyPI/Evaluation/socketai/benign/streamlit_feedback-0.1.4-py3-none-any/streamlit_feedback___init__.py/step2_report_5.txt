  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's function as a feedback component, with standard sources such as environment variables, session state, and user interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies callback functions and internal data flow within session state.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, focusing on UI and state management, with no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.95 — reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the low security risk score aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flow from user input to callback.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, code obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies standard patterns, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the component's operation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate, with feedback passing through session state and callback.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, external requests, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Validates the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Sound reasoning, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable given the development environment setup.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly assesses the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risks in session state management and development environment setup, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured Streamlit component for user feedback.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (reflecting typical development considerations, not actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable.
