{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit component for user feedback, allowing different feedback types ('thumbs' or 'faces') with optional textual input and callback handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.path and st.session_state), file paths for component build, and user inputs via the Streamlit interface.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends feedback data to callback functions, stores state in session variables, and loads external components or examples.",
  "flows": "User input triggers the component, which updates session state and optionally invokes callback functions; feedback data flows from user input through the component to storage or callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is mainly standard for a Streamlit component with development and production modes, with straightforward control flow. No obfuscated code, suspicious external requests, or hidden malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, manages development and production configurations, and defines a feedback component with input validation, state management, and callback invocation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The external component loading and example app imports are typical for development. The code ensures feedback is only submitted once per session key, which is standard behavior. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Streamlit feedback component without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of a Streamlit feedback component, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages user feedback inputs securely and does not contain hidden or suspicious code elements.",
