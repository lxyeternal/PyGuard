  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured Streamlit component for feedback collection.\n- No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious external activity are identified.\n- The code uses standard libraries, environment-based configuration, and input validation.\n- The only minor concern is the use of local URLs during development, which is typical and not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly describe the code's purpose and functionality.\n- **Malware presence:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- **Input validation:** Proper validation for feedback types and alignment is implemented.\n- **Callback handling:** The 'on_submit' callback is standard and used appropriately.\n- **Paths and environment:** Proper handling of development vs production modes, no hardcoded credentials.\n- **External dependencies:** Standard libraries, no external network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2). Given the code's purpose and the absence of vulnerabilities, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and justified. No adjustments needed for the scores.\n- The higher end of the security risk (~0.2) is acceptable, considering the code handles user input and callback functions, which could be misused if misconfigured, but nothing indicates actual misuse here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (minimal, mainly due to the potential for callback misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard for UI components that accept user input and callbacks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Streamlit feedback component with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
