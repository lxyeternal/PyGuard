{
  "purpose": "A Streamlit component for collecting user feedback via thumbs or faces, with environment-based configuration for development and production modes.",
  "sources": "User interactions (feedback buttons, text input), environment variables, file paths for component loading, session state for tracking submission status.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked upon feedback submission, session state updates, internal data flow; no external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "User input → session state check/update → callback invocation (if provided) → feedback data returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of local URLs during development is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard feedback UI component with input validation, environment-based component declaration, and session state management. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or obfuscation. Callback functions are user-defined and typical for such components. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a feedback component with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
