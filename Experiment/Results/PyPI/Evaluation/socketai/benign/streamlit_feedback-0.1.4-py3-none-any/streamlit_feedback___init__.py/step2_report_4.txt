  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a Streamlit feedback component, with standard sources like environment variables, file paths, session state, and user interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that the callback 'on_submit' is a potential sink, with data flowing from user input to callback and session state.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard, with proper input validation, environment-based component declaration, and session management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, input validation, environment setup, and no malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Also aligns with previous reports, highlighting standard practices, no suspicious external activity, and proper validation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Continues the pattern of recognizing standard component setup, validation, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still reasonable considering the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar conclusion: standard, secure, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify malware=0. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code is purely UI and state management.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The securityRisk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's nature—standard UI component with callback handling—these are reasonable.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The code's use of local URLs during development (when `_RELEASE` is False) is typical and not malicious.\n- The session state management and input validation are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The callback 'on_submit' is a user-provided function, which could be malicious if the user supplies a malicious function, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final verdict:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to standard practices and no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the provided scores, reflecting minimal concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Streamlit feedback component with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
