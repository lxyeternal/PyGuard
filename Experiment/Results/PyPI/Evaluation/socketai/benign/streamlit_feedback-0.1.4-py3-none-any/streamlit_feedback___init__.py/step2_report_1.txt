  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a feedback component with environment-based setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback data flows internally, with no external data leakage or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard practices.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, non-malicious implementation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, given it's a UI component with minimal security concern).  \n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard component creation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through user interaction and callback functions; no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code for feedback collection.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, with emphasis on session state and component setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback data flows internally; no external data leaks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured component.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with prior descriptions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through user interaction and callback functions; no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to development mode behaviors, but still minimal. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with focus on environment and callback handling.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Feedback data is processed internally; no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard feedback component.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are 0.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the component's UI nature and lack of external network activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of a Streamlit feedback component.\n- No external network calls, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent are evident.\n- The use of session state and callback functions is typical and safe.\n- The environment handling for development vs production is standard practice.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to development mode behaviors, but nothing concerning)\n\n**Conclusion:** The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's analysis.",
