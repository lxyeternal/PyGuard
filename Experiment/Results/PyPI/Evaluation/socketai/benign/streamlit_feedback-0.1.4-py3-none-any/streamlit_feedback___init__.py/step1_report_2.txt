{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit custom component for collecting user feedback, supporting 'thumbs' or 'faces' feedback types, with optional text input and callback handling.",
  "sources": "User inputs include the 'feedback_type' parameter, component interactions via _component_func, and optional callback 'on_submit'. It also reads environment variables and file paths for component deployment.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through the component_value received from the frontend component to callback functions and possibly to stored session state or external callbacks.",
  "flows": "User interaction triggers data from frontend component (via _component_func) → stored in st.session_state → passed to on_submit callback if provided → feedback or response returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code includes standard component setup, error handling for invalid parameters, and environment setup for development. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system disruption code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a feedback component with parameter validation, environment-based component declaration (development vs production), and session state management. Input validation prevents invalid feedback types or alignments. It conditionally calls a callback on submission. The 'examples' import section only runs during development, with standard error handling. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a well-structured, standard Streamlit component implementation for feedback collection. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is mainly concerned with UI component setup, input validation, and session management, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
