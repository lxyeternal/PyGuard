  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'esphome-dashboard' Python package, used to configure and install the package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, package discovery via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) -> package setup configuration (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads the long description from a local README.md file, defines package metadata, and discovers packages to include. All operations are typical for package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No user input is processed, and no data is transmitted externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical setup configuration with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
