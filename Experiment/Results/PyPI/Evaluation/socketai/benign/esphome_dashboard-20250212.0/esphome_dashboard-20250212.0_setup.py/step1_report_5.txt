  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'esphome-dashboard' Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing modules os and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Reading the file content as long_description during setup; no other data flow or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard package setup code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file for the description, defines package metadata, and invokes setup() with standard parameters. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code contains no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. All imported modules are standard and used in common ways for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for package distribution.",
