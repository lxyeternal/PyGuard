  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'esphome-dashboard' Python package, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing standard libraries, package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content (source) for long description during setup (sink), no other data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and invokes setup() with package metadata. No malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. It does not perform any network operations, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted input beyond reading a static file. All functions are typical of package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
