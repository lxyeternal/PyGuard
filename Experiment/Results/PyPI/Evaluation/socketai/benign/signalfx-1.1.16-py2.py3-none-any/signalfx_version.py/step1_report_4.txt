  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'signalfx' Python package, including its name, version, and user agent string.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting 'name', 'version', and 'user_agent' variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data outputs or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of static assignments without dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, assigning static string values to variables representing package metadata. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The user agent string is constructed via simple concatenation, which is benign. The code appears to be part of a package's metadata declaration, typical in setup scripts or module initializations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata assignments with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
