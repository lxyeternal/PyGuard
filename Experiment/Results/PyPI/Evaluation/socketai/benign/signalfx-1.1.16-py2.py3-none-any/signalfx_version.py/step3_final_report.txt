  "purpose": "Static assignment of package metadata variables (name, version, user_agent) for a Python package setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string literals to variables: 'name', 'version', 'user_agent'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignments with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended for package configuration. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is found. The scores are consistent with the code's straightforward static assignment nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and no further action or scrutiny is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
