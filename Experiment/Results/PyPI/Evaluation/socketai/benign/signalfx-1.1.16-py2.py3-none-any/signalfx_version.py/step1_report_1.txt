  "purpose": "Define package metadata and user agent string for the signalfx Python library.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting variables 'name', 'version', and 'user_agent'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward metadata initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static string values to variables indicating package name, version, and user agent. There are no dynamic inputs, no network operations, no data collection, or obfuscated code. It appears to be part of package setup or configuration without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only basic variable assignments related to package metadata, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
