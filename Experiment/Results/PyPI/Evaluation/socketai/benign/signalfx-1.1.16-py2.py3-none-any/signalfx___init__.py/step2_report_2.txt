  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any discrepancies, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides a client library with login, ingest, and SignalFlow functionalities. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard use of requests.post for login, tokens supplied externally.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious activity detected. The low risk score seems reasonable, considering the code's purpose.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard API client patterns, no suspicious code, tokens are managed securely, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard nature of the client library, safe handling of credentials, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the code is straightforward, with minimal risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the straightforward, standard API client pattern, no suspicious or malicious code, secure handling of credentials, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Well justified; the code is a typical SDK client.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirms the code is a standard client library, with secure handling of tokens and credentials, no obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None.\n- **Tokens and credentials handling:** Proper, supplied externally, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Network activity:** Standard API requests, no suspicious or hidden behavior.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with low risk scores (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is justified. However, since the code involves handling sensitive tokens and credentials, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) is reasonable but not higher.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
