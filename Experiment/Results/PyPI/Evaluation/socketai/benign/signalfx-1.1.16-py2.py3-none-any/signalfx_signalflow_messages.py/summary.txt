  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured message parser with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to handling untrusted payloads, but no actual vulnerabilities are present."
