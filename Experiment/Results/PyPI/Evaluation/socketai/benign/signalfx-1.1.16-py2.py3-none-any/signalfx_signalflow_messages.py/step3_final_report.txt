{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for decoding and representing various SignalFlow stream messages, converting payload dictionaries into message objects.",
  "sources": "Payload dictionaries received from external sources, typically in JSON-like format.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions; primarily object creation and logging warnings.",
  "flows": "Payload data is parsed into message objects via static decode methods; no external actions or data flows beyond parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static decoding of message payloads into class instances without executing untrusted code or performing side effects. No network, file, or system modifications are present. Logging is used for unsupported message types, which is benign. Payload assumptions are typical for such parsers. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. The code is a standard message decoding library, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured message parser with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to handling untrusted payloads, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
