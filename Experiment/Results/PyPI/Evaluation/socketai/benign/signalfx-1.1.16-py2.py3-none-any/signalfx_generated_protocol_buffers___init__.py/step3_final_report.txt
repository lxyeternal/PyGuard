  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments containing dynamic execution (`exec`), dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`), input reading, environment variable access, and misleading variable names.",
  "sinks": "Execution of untrusted input, dynamic module loading, potential data exfiltration points, and obfuscated code sections.",
  "flows": "Input data or untrusted sources flow into `exec` or dynamic import statements, potentially leading to malicious payload execution or code injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `exec` with unvalidated input, dynamic module imports, minimal comments, misleading variable names, obfuscation patterns, and lack of validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code with `exec(input_data)` and dynamic imports suggests obfuscation and malicious intent, justified by high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.85) scores. Benign code shows standard patterns with no suspicious activity, warranting zero scores. No code indicates no analysis possible. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and patterns, with high suspicion appropriately reflected in the scores for the suspicious code, and low scores for benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports' scores are justified and aligned with the evidence. Report 2's high scores reflect strong indicators of malicious or obfuscated code, while other reports correctly indicate benign or absent code. No adjustments are necessary.",
