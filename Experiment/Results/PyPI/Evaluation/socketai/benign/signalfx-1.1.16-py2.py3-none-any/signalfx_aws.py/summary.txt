  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for retrieving AWS environment identifiers. It poses minimal security risk, contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and scores appropriately with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The assessments across reports are consistent and justified."
