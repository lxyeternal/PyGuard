{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve AWS instance identifiers (EC2 or ECS) for use as dimensions in SignalFx data points.",
  "sources": "Reads data from AWS metadata endpoints (ECS and EC2 URLs), which are trusted sources for AWS instance metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; does not write data to external locations or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Requests are made to metadata URLs; responses are parsed for specific JSON keys to construct a unique ID.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs for AWS metadata endpoints; does not perform input validation on JSON responses but this is standard for AWS metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve AWS metadata from well-known, trusted internal URLs. It handles network timeouts and errors gracefully, logging warnings without exposing or mishandling data. No code injections, malicious network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of requests library and JSON parsing is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely and legitimately retrieves AWS instance identifiers for telemetry purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
