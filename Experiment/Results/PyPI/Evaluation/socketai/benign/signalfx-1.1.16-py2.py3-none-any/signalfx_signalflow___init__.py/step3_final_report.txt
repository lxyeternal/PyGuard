  "purpose": "Client wrapper for SignalFx's SignalFlow real-time analytics API, managing computations via network calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as token, program, start/stop times, and other configuration options passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "Network calls made through the external transport layer (`self._transport.execute`, `preflight`, `start`, `attach`, etc.), which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters through `_get_params()` filtering, into transport layer method calls, and back via computation objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External modules handle network interactions; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client managing real-time computations via network calls. It filters parameters securely, delegates network communication to external modules, and manages computation objects. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The token is passed during initialization but not hardcoded. External modules' trustworthiness is assumed. The logic is clear, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected API client functions without malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), considering network interactions but no vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
