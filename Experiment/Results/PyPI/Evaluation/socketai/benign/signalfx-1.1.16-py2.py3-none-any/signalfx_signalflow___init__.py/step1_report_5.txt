  "purpose": "Client interface for SignalFx's SignalFlow real-time analytics API, enabling execution, management, and streaming of computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class methods such as token, program, start, stop, filters, handle, reason, and optional kwargs within methods.",
  "sinks": "Transport layer methods (execute, preflight, start, attach, keepalive, stop, close) that could potentially send data over the network or perform system actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method calls to transport layer functions, which may send or receive data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution; the code mainly orchestrates API calls and manages computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class to interact with a real-time analytics API, utilizing transport mechanisms for network communication. It manages computations via internal sets and provides various methods for executing, preflighting, starting, attaching, keeping alive, stopping, and closing computations. Inputs are method parameters, with some default constants used for endpoints and timeouts. The transport layer methods are called with parameters and do not contain embedded malicious code. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. All data flow appears to be limited to legitimate API interactions. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for managing SignalFlow computations with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only orchestrates network calls and internal state management without suspicious actions or hidden functionality.",
