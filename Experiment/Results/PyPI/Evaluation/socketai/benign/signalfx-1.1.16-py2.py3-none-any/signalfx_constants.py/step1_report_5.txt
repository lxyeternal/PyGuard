  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for SignalFx integration in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None; all values are hardcoded constants and lists.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, including URLs, batch size, timeouts, integer boundaries, and supported event categories. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The constants appear to be standard configuration parameters for a monitoring or analytics SDK or service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code is static and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup defining constants for a monitoring service. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
