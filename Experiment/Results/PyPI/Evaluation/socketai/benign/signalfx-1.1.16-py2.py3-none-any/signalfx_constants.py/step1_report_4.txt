  "purpose": "Define default endpoints, parameters, and supported event categories for a SignalFx (Splunk) client library.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for endpoints and default values; list of supported event categories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data handling or user inputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely initializes constants and a list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious functions, no unusual or obfuscated code. The code consists only of constant definitions and a list.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining default URLs, configuration parameters, and supported categories. It does not perform any I/O, data processing, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The absence of input handling or external data manipulation reduces risk, and the static nature of the code indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration or constants module used for a SignalFx client library. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
