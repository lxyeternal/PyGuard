  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for SignalFx data ingestion and configuration.",
  "sources": "No input reading; static constant definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; only constant assignments and list initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes default endpoint URLs, batch size, timeout, integer boundaries, and supported event categories. All values are hardcoded, with no dynamic or external input involved. There are no functions, data processing, or external communications that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code appears to be configuration/setup for a larger system. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration constants for a SignalFx client or library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
