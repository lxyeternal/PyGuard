  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the assessments provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static configuration with no input/output, no dynamic code, no network operations, and no obfuscation.\n- The constants and lists are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or that could hide malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The URLs are standard endpoints, and the constants are typical for configuration purposes.\n- The absence of any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling aligns with a benign purpose.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is static configuration, the risk of malicious activity is inherently very low.\n- The only consideration might be if these constants are being used elsewhere insecurely, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores or assessments are necessary.\n- The code is safe, benign, and typical for configuration purposes.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The code is purely static configuration with no apparent security concerns.",
