{
  "purpose": "Static configuration constants defining endpoints, batch size, timeout, integer bounds, and supported categories for a monitoring or data ingestion system.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals and numeric constants within the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources; static constants only",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or dynamic execution present",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward static configuration with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions with no input/output, dynamic code, or external data processing. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The URLs and categories are standard and hardcoded. All reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and safe nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
