  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for SignalFx data ingestion and event categorization.",
  "sources": "Constants and configuration variables initialized with static values.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external input sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; code only sets static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static constant definitions such as endpoints, batch sizes, timeouts, integer bounds, and supported event categories. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no sensitive data processing. All values are hardcoded and appear to serve as configuration parameters. The absence of input processing or external data sources indicates low risk for supply chain or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration setup defining static constants for a monitoring service. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It is safe and intended for use as part of a larger system.",
