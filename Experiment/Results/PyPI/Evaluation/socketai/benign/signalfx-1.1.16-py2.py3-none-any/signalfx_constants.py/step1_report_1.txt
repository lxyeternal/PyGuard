  "purpose": "Define default configuration parameters and constants for a SignalFx-related Python module or application.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables initialized with static values, including URLs, batch size, timeout, and supported categories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; all variables are statically assigned string literals or numeric constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets constants and supported categories without processing input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed; the code appears to be straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several default URLs, batch size, timeout, and defines supported event categories. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no cryptic or obfuscated logic. It is a static configuration snippet without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe and typical for defining constants used in a monitoring or data ingestion context.",
