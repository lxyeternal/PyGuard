  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code snippets are purely static constant definitions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward configuration constants with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static constants, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Static configuration, no input/output, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Static constants, no data handling or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; static configuration constants.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. The code is purely static configuration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as there's no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Any higher scores?**  \nNo. Given the static, benign nature of the code, raising the scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Category      | Score |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Malware       | 0       |\n| Obfuscated    | 0       |\n| Risk          | 0       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration constants. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is a safe, static configuration setup with no security concerns.",
