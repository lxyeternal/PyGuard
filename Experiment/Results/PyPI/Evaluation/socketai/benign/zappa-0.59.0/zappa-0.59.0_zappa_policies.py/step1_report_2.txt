  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task (not specified in the provided snippet).",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from environment variables, function arguments, or external modules.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files, network sockets, or displays data on the screen. Potential data leaks may occur if untrusted input is used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No unusual code patterns or code injection mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, utilizing common Python constructs. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. No unsafe SQL or insecure number generation observed. The code's structure and flow do not suggest obfuscation or malware. Without additional context or hidden code, the risk seems low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to perform its intended function without malicious modifications or backdoors.",
