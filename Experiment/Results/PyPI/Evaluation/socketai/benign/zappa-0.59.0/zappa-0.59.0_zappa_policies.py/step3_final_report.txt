{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing or utility functions with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; likely standard input or data files used within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs, logs, or network transmissions if present, but none are indicated as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), with no suspicious or malicious pathways observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with typical Python constructs, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior. Confidence in benign nature is high due to lack of suspicious patterns and consistent analysis across multiple reports. The risk score remains low at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern given current information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring aligns with the observed benign characteristics, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
