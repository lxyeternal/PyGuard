  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious indicators, benign code, high confidence (0.6), malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The report states no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior. Given the lack of specific code snippets, this seems reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is consistent. Security risk at 0.2 seems slightly cautious but acceptable given minimal context.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning aligns with the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward code, no malicious patterns, high confidence (0.8), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the report finds no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is justified. The low risk score is consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity, benign structure, confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes typical Python constructs, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0 is appropriate. Risk remains low.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious indicators, straightforward code, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the findings.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No evidence of malicious behavior, benign code, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains at 0, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The reports uniformly suggest the code appears benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n- **Security risk scores:** Uniformly low at 0.2, which is reasonable given the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports unless new evidence emerges.\n- The risk scores could be slightly adjusted upwards if additional context suggests potential vulnerabilities, but based on current info, 0.2 is appropriate.\n- No changes needed to the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (consistent with reports)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** **0.2** (low, but cautious)\n\nThe analysis confirms that the code appears benign and the scoring aligns well with the observations.",
