{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python package 'zappa', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads Pipfile for dependencies, accesses package version from zappa.__version__, and uses standard setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted. No data leakage or command execution points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files (README.md, Pipfile) and package attributes (version) into the setup configuration; no untrusted external input flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of standard library functions and well-known packages is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads package metadata and dependencies, and invokes setup() with appropriate parameters. All data sources are static files or package attributes. The dependency list is constructed dynamically but solely from the Pipfile, which is a normal practice. No external inputs are processed at runtime that could be malicious. The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script for 'zappa' with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It safely reads static files and package metadata, and there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious code injection.",
