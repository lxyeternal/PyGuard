{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'zappa', intended to prepare the package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading Pipfile for dependencies, and importing package version from zappa.__version__.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks that could leak untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified. Data flows from local files (README.md, Pipfile) and package metadata, with no external input or output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The script follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file for long description, reads dependencies from a Pipfile, and sets up package metadata for distribution. The dependencies are dynamically generated from Pipfile entries. All operations are typical for package setup. No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no external data manipulation or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a package distribution configuration.",
