{
  "purpose": "To set up the packaging and distribution configuration for the 'zappa' Python project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'Pipfile' for dependencies; importing '__version__' from 'zappa'; environment variables or external input are not used.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external communication in the setup script.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; dependency requirements are derived from configuration files, not untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard setup practices with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package description and dependencies from standard files, defines package metadata, and invokes setup() for packaging. All operations are typical for Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications are present. Dependencies are read from safe configuration files. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs normal operations for packaging a Python project. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
