  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; primarily reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Reads files (README.md, Pipfile), processes dependency lists, and passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Usage of standard libraries and setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration and metadata from files, constructs dependency lists, and invokes the setuptools setup function with package details. No code injection, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The code adheres to typical Python packaging standards without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
