{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'zappa' library, reading static files and configuration data to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'Pipfile' for dependencies, and imports '__version__' from the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data from files flows into setup() parameters; no untrusted input or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that reads static configuration files and package metadata, then calls setuptools.setup() with this data. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input. Dependency information is sourced from local files, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, typical Python packaging configuration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
