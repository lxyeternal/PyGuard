{
  "purpose": "The code provides a WSGI middleware for Zappa deployment that permutes case of strings and modifies 'Set-Cookie' header names to ensure compatibility with AWS.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the WSGI environment 'environ' and response headers; the 'application' callable is invoked with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'start_response' callable is used to send modified headers back to the server. Headers are manipulated before being sent.",
  "flows": "Input 'environ' is passed to the application; headers in the response are filtered and case-modified before being forwarded via 'start_response'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. The header case manipulation is standard practice for compatibility and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string permutation generator, which is unrelated to security risks. The middleware class adjusts the 'Set-Cookie' header name case to avoid AWS issues. It creates a wrapper around the application, intercepts headers, filters out original 'Set-Cookie' headers, and re-adds them with lowercase. The code does not perform any network connections, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign middleware component designed for compatibility with AWS deployment. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is straightforward header case permutation, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
