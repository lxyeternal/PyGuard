The only minor concern is the unused 'all_casings' function, which does not impact security. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report (0.1) should be adjusted to 0, as the code is standard and safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, comprehensive AWS deployment utility for Python applications. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is detected. The low security risk is due to potential resource misconfiguration if inputs are malicious, which is typical for deployment scripts but does not indicate malicious intent. Maintaining standard input validation and least-privilege permissions is recommended, but overall, supply chain security posture is sound."

The security risk is minimal, primarily limited to benign network requests for version checks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting low operational risk."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits severe security vulnerabilities primarily due to the use of 'exec' on event data and remote configuration loading without validation, enabling remote code execution and supply chain attacks. While designed for flexible deployment, these patterns pose high risks if inputs are untrusted. The malware score should be close to 0.9, and the overall security risk should also be around 0.9, indicating a highly insecure state that requires mitigation measures before safe deployment."
