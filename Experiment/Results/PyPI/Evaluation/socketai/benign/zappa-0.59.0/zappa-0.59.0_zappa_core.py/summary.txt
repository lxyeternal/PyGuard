  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, comprehensive AWS deployment utility for Python applications. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is detected. The low security risk is due to potential resource misconfiguration if inputs are malicious, which is typical for deployment scripts but does not indicate malicious intent. Maintaining standard input validation and least-privilege permissions is recommended, but overall, supply chain security posture is sound."
