  "purpose": "Determine if the script is running inside a Docker container and verify Python version compatibility for the Zappa framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER', sys.version_info, and prints error messages.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output, raises RuntimeError on version mismatch.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> version verification -> potential error message output or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily checks environment variables and Python version info to enforce compatibility constraints. It reads 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER' environment variable to detect Docker environment, and uses sys.version_info to verify the Python version against supported versions. The code raises exceptions if version requirements are not met, which is typical for environment validation scripts. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network activity or data leaks are present. The logic appears straightforward and intended for environment validation. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior; the code functions as a compatibility check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment and version validation script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard checks and raises errors accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
