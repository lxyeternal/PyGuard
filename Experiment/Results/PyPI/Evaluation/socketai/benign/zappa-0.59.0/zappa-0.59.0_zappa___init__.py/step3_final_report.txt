  "purpose": "Environment detection and Python version validation for Zappa deployment, ensuring compatibility inside and outside Docker.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER', sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "RuntimeError exceptions raised on invalid environment or version conditions",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences version validation logic; version info used to determine support status",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward environment and version checks",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER' to determine if running in Docker, then validates Python version against supported list or minimum version based on environment. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected. It raises RuntimeError on invalid configurations. The logic is standard and clear, with no suspicious patterns or external data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment and version validation script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report (0.1) should be adjusted to 0, as the code is standard and safe.",
