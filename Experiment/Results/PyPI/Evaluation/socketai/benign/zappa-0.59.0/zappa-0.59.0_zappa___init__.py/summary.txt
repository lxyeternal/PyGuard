  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment and version validation script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report (0.1) should be adjusted to 0, as the code is standard and safe."
