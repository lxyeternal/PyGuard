  "purpose": "Determine if the environment is running inside Docker and validate Python version compatibility for the application.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER', sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Print statements, RuntimeError exceptions",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences version validation logic, which leads to either normal execution or raising errors",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code checks an environment variable to determine if it's running inside Docker. It then verifies the Python version against supported versions unless in Docker, where it enforces a minimum version. All logic appears standard for environment checks and version validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden functionalities. The print and exception statements serve typical debugging and error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs environment detection and version validation using standard Python practices with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It adheres to typical security patterns for environment checks and error reporting.",
