{
  "purpose": "Determine the runtime environment and Python version support for the Zappa application, particularly distinguishing between Docker and non-Docker environments.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() to read environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER', sys.version_info to read Python version information",
  "sinks": "print() function (for debugging or informational output), RuntimeError (to halt execution with an error message)",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER' influences conditional logic; sys.version_info is checked to enforce supported Python versions; errors are raised based on these checks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of environment variable and version checks is standard practice; no suspicious code flow or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable to determine if it is running in Docker and checks the Python version against supported versions. It raises errors if the Python version is unsupported depending on the environment. The logic is straightforward and intended for environment validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, only environment validation code. The use of print and RuntimeError for control flow is standard for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment and version checks to ensure compatibility for the Zappa deployment. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a standard validation script for deployment requirements.",
