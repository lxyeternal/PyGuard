{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check if the application is running inside a Docker container and verify the Python version for compatibility with Zappa and AWS Lambda.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER' for detecting Docker; sys.version_info for Python version info.",
  "targets": "Prints debug information; raises RuntimeError if version constraints are not met.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Python version info -> conditional logic for version validation -> error message and exception if conditions are not satisfied.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Usage of environment variables and version checks is standard; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and sys modules, defines a function to detect Docker environment via an environment variable, then checks the Python version against supported versions. It raises RuntimeError with messages if unsupported versions are detected outside Docker, or if the version is below the minimum supported in Docker mode. The code's logic is straightforward and does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or system harm. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The environment variable usage is standard for environment detection, and version validation is typical for compatibility enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment and version checks for Zappa deployment with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be standard version validation logic with no malicious intent.",
