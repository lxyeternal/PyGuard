  "purpose": "Determine the runtime environment and enforce Python version support based on whether running inside Docker or not.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() for environment variable 'ZAPPA_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER', sys.version_info for Python version info.",
  "sinks": "Printing version support information, raising RuntimeError with detailed messages.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences conditional logic; sys.version_info influences version validation; errors are raised based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of environment variable to modify behavior is standard but should be monitored. No obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies if it is running inside Docker via an environment variable, then enforces Python version constraints accordingly. It only raises errors if conditions are not met. No data exfiltration, network activity, or suspicious code appears present. The use of environment variables and version checks is typical for environment-specific configurations. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an environment and version check with error reporting, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate environment validation script with standard practices.",
