{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file operations, URL parsing, environment detection, AWS Lambda validation, logging, and event source management, supporting deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "External URL inputs (e.g., parse_s3_url, detect_django_settings, detect_flask_apps), environment variables, network requests (PyPI version check), AWS SDK calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to PyPI, AWS SDK interactions, file system operations, environment variable reads, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data from URL parsing or environment variables flows into validation or network requests; AWS SDK calls interact with external AWS services; logging outputs record operational info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External network requests are benign. No backdoors or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of deployment support utilities, including file copying, URL parsing, environment detection, AWS Lambda validation, and logging. It makes benign network requests to PyPI for version checking and interacts with AWS services via standard SDKs. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The functions are straightforward, and the network activity is typical for deployment tools. The code structure and external interactions are consistent with benign, operational code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily limited to benign network requests for version checks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting low operational risk.",
