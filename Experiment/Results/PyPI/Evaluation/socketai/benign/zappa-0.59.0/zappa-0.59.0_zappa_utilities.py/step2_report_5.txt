  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code content, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility module with functions for file operations, URL parsing, environment detection, AWS Lambda validation, logging, and event handling. No malicious code or obfuscation detected. Network requests are to public endpoints (PyPI), and logs are for debugging only.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily utility functions. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. External requests are benign. Logging is for debugging, not leaking sensitive info.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code supports deployment tasks, with standard SDK interactions and benign network activity (PyPI version check). No malicious patterns or secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. The functions are standard and intended for deployment support.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on utility functions for AWS Lambda management, URL parsing, validation, and logging. External network calls are benign, and no malicious payloads are evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The network request to PyPI is normal for version checking. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for environment detection, file handling, AWS SDK interactions, and validation. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Network requests are benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard deployment utility code, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for environment detection, URL parsing, validation, and logging. No malicious activity or obfuscation. External requests are benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code content. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code content. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2, reflecting that these are utility functions with minimal security impact. Given the code's purpose and the absence of vulnerabilities, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a set of utility functions for deployment, environment detection, validation, and logging. All functions are standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Network Calls:** Only external network requests to PyPI for version checking, which is benign.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** The functions that interact with AWS services via boto3/botocore are standard; they do not contain malicious logic.\n\n- **Security Implications:** No secrets, no backdoors, no suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (low, standard utility functions, minimal attack surface)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility library for deployment and operational support, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should reflect this assessment with **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, and **risk = 0.1**.",
