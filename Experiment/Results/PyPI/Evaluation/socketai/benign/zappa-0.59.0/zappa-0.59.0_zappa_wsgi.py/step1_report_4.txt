{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a WSGI environment dictionary from API Gateway event data to enable WSGI-compatible web applications to run on serverless environments, specifically AWS Lambda.",
  "sources": "Data sources include event_info (API Gateway event payload), headers, query parameters, request body, requestContext, and environmental headers such as 'X-Forwarded-For'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the constructed WSGI environ dictionary, which is used by web frameworks or applications, and the logger output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from event_info (inputs) through processing functions that parse headers, query parameters, body, and request context, into the environ dict; also, input data is logged via common_log.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code handles Base64 decoding for binary content, but this is standard for such applications. No obfuscation, malicious network connections, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses API Gateway event data to create a WSGI environment. It handles URL encoding, header normalization, base64 decoding for binary data, and constructs environment variables for a WSGI server. The function 'create_wsgi_request' does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic; it performs expected data parsing and environment setup. The logging function 'common_log' formats and logs request details, which is typical for web servers. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of 'sys.stderr' and standard libraries further suggests routine functionality. Overall, the code is consistent with a typical API Gateway to WSGI conversion process, with no malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for creating a WSGI environment from API Gateway events, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It correctly processes input data, handles binary content, and logs request details without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
