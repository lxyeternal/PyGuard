  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility function to convert API Gateway event data into a WSGI environment.\n- It handles headers, query parameters, body (including base64 decoding), request context, and constructs environment variables accordingly.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and practices.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The request parsing and environment setup appear correct and secure.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data flow:** Accurate; constructs WSGI environment from API Gateway event info.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly states the code performs standard request parsing and environment creation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, minor concern, possibly due to the general nature of input handling)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Proper handling of request data, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Data flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and typical for such use.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Data flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard request environment creation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, consistent with minimal risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Data flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns; standard processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to input handling.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minor, inherent risk in handling untrusted input, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented utility for converting API Gateway events into WSGI environments, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the code's behavior.",
