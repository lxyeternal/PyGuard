  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of their reasoning, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Purpose: Converts API Gateway event data into a WSGI environment for Python web apps in AWS Lambda.\n- Key features: Handles multi-value query params, headers, binary payloads (base64), request context, header normalization, and logging.\n- No evident malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Claim:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard request parsing.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the handling of base64, headers, and request context.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk reflects the routine nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1; standard request conversion with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly emphasizes safe handling of data, no obfuscation, no code injection.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent; the slightly higher security risk (0.2) is acceptable given the potential for header spoofing but is not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Claim:** Standard conversion, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; recognizes standard handling of payloads, headers, and request context.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Well-founded; no issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Claim:** Routine conversion with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code performs expected parsing, encoding, and logging.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Claim:** Standard, safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect minimal security concerns like header spoofing, which are typical and not malicious.\n\n### Final Estimation\n\n**Malware:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation techniques are used.\n\n**Risk:** Around 0.1–0.2, considering the potential for header spoofing and request manipulation, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent, thorough, and justified.\n- No changes needed in their reasoning or scoring.\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation for API Gateway to WSGI environment conversion.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis indicates a low-risk, benign utility with no malicious intent.",
