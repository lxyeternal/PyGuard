{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a WSGI environment from API Gateway event data for AWS Lambda integrations, facilitating web request handling.",
  "sources": "Inputs from 'event_info' such as 'httpMethod', 'queryStringParameters', 'multiValueQueryStringParameters', 'headers', 'body', 'path', and 'requestContext'.",
  "sinks": "Setting WSGI environ variables, especially 'wsgi.input' (body), headers, and environment variables such as 'PATH_INFO', 'QUERY_STRING', 'REMOTE_ADDR', and 'HTTP_' prefixed headers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from event_info inputs through parsing and processing (e.g., query parameters, headers, body) into the WSGI environment, which is then used for application execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of base64 decoding for request body is standard for binary data support. The code performs normal request parsing and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code securely parses API Gateway event data to construct a WSGI environment, handling multi-value query parameters, headers, and binary body data with proper encoding. It includes normal handling of headers and request context, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious dynamic code execution. Sensitive data handling appears standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The use of base64 decoding for encoded bodies and header processing are appropriate for the context. The code does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification. It simply processes request data into an environment for downstream applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for creating a WSGI environment from API Gateway events, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
