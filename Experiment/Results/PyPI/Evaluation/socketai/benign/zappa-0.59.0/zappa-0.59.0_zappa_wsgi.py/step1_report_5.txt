{
  "purpose": "This code creates a WSGI environment dictionary from API Gateway event data for use in a web application, handling request parsing, header normalization, and logging.",
  "sources": "Data sources include API Gateway event payload (event_info), request headers, query parameters, request body, and request context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the WSGI environment dictionary, where untrusted input is assigned to environment variables and headers, and the logging function that may output request details.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, body, query params, request context) flows into environment variable assignments; untrusted header and body data are incorporated into the environment; logs include request details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity is detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests normal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs a WSGI environment from API Gateway event data, including handling of base64-encoded bodies, header normalization, query string encoding, and IP address extraction. It processes headers and request context data without evident malicious modifications or obfuscation. The logging function uses standard formatting for access logs. No embedded network activity, file modifications, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code adheres to common patterns for serverless request handling and does not include suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for translating API Gateway events into WSGI environments. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate web request processing.",
