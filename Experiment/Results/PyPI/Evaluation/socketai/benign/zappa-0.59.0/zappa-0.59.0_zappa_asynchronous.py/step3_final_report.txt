{
  "purpose": "Provides an AWS Lambda/SNS async task dispatch framework with dynamic function import based on 'task_path'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'task_path' for dynamic import, environment variables for AWS configuration, message data for task execution.",
  "sinks": "Invokes AWS Lambda or SNS services, imports modules/functions dynamically, updates DynamoDB with response status.",
  "flows": "Receives message -> imports function via 'task_path' -> executes function -> optionally updates DynamoDB with response -> sends message via Lambda or SNS.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import without explicit validation of 'task_path', potential misuse if 'task_path' is manipulated by untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard async dispatch system leveraging AWS Lambda and SNS, with response tracking via DynamoDB. The main security concern is the unvalidated 'task_path' used for dynamic import, which could be exploited to load malicious modules if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to potential misuse of dynamic import. Proper validation or whitelisting of 'task_path' would mitigate this risk. The code is clear and legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS-based async task dispatcher with a moderate security risk stemming from unvalidated dynamic imports. No malware or obfuscation detected. To enhance security, validate 'task_path' inputs to prevent potential exploitation.",
