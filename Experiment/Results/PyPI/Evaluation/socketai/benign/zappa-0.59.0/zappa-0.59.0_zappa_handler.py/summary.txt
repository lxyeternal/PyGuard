  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits severe security vulnerabilities primarily due to the use of 'exec' on event data and remote configuration loading without validation, enabling remote code execution and supply chain attacks. While designed for flexible deployment, these patterns pose high risks if inputs are untrusted. The malware score should be close to 0.9, and the overall security risk should also be around 0.9, indicating a highly insecure state that requires mitigation measures before safe deployment."
