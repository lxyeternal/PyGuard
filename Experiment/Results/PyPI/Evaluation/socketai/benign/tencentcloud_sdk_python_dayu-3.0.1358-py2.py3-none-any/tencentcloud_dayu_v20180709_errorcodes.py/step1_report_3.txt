  "purpose": "Define constants for various operation statuses and error codes used in an SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading; only constant definitions).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; only static string constants and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only string constant definitions representing status and error codes, along with licensing comments. No dynamic or executable code, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard enumeration of status codes, typical for SDKs or APIs. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for API operation statuses and errors. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
