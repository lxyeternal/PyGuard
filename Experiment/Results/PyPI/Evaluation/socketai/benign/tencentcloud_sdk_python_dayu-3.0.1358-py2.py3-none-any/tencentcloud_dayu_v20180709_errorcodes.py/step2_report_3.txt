  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static string constants representing API status and error codes.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network communication, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for SDKs or API client libraries.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude the code is benign, with confidence 1, malware 0, and security risk 0.\n- The descriptions are consistent and accurate; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are reported.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is simply constant definitions, there is no indication of security threats.\n- The reports do not mention any indirect vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which aligns with the code content.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are reasonable.\n\n**Final expert judgment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign constants module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No suspicious or malicious elements detected.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
