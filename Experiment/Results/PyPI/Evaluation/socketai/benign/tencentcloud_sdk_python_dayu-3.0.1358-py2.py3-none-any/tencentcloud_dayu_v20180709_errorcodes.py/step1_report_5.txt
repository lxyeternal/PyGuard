{
  "purpose": "Define constant string variables representing various operation statuses and error codes, likely for use in an API or SDK.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to variables at the global scope.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; variables are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard practices for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of string variable assignments representing status and error codes, with licensing comments at the top. There is no input processing, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data. All variables are static and predefined, indicating standard constant definitions. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or code sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of constant definitions used for status/error reporting within a larger system. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
