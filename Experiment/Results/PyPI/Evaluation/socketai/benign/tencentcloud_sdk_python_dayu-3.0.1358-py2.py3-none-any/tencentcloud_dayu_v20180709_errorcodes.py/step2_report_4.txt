  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of static string constant definitions representing API status and error codes. There is no dynamic logic, user input handling, network communication, or data processing. The code is straightforward, with licensing comments and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**  \n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present.  \n- The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.  \n- The constants are standard, human-readable, and typical for SDKs or API client libraries.\n\n3. **Anomalies or Flaws**  \n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.  \n- The code is a typical constants module, serving as an enumeration of response codes.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.  \n- The confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**  \n- The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on this code snippet alone.  \n- Since the code is only constants, it cannot be malicious by itself. Malicious behavior would depend on how these constants are used elsewhere, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)  \n\n**Final Justification:**  \nGiven the evidence, the code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
