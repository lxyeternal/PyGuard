  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature:**\n   - The code consists solely of string constant definitions representing API response and error codes.\n   - It includes licensing comments and no executable logic, input handling, or external interactions.\n   - The constants are static, straightforward, and typical for SDKs or API client libraries.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious functions.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is clean, well-commented, and standard.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify it as a set of static constants for API status/error codes.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and all scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are zero.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or indicators.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Potential for Underlying Issues:**\n   - Since the code is purely static constants, the risk is minimal.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are justified here; the code is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign constants module, typical in SDKs or API libraries.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- I agree with the existing scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is safe, well-understood, and poses no security threat.\n- The reporting is accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, straightforward constants.                            |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.                   |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature.",
