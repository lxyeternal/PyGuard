  "purpose": "Define string constants for various API response statuses and error codes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for status and error code constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; all code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions representing API response statuses and error codes. It includes licensing comments and no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious functions, or suspicious logic. The constants are standard, readable, and serve as identifiers within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of static string definitions for API response status and error codes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.",
