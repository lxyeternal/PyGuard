{
  "purpose": "This code defines static string constants representing various API response and error codes, serving as a reference for handling API responses within an SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static constant definitions; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or manipulate data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for constants modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants for API status and error codes, with licensing comments. It contains no executable logic, input handling, network activity, or data processing. The absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs indicates a benign purpose. All reports agree on its harmless nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm that it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard constants module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
