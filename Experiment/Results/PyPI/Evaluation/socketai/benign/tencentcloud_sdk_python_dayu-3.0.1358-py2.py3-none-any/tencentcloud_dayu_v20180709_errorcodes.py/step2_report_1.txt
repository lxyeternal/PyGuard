  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static string constants representing API status and error codes.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard constants module, typical in SDKs or API client libraries.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None of the reports indicate any malicious intent or behavior. The code is purely static and straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No logical flaws or errors are evident; the code is simple constant definitions.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware score: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n  - Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this code is benign.\n- Since the code is just constant definitions, it inherently carries no security risk.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign constants module.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risk is present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to this being a safe, non-malicious component. No further action or concern is warranted.",
