  "purpose": "Define constants for various API response status codes and error messages related to Tencent cloud services.",
  "sources": "N/A (constants are hardcoded string values, not data input sources).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data sinks or output involving untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward definitions of constants.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a set of string constants representing different status or error codes for an API. All constants are statically assigned string values, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or user input processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static set of constant definitions for API response codes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK or API client library.",
