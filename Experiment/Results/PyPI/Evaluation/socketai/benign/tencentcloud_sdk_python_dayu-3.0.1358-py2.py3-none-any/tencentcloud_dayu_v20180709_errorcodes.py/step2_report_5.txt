  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of static string constants defining API status and error codes.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, no input/output handling, and no external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code appears to be a standard part of an SDK or API client library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The summaries are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious, with no hidden behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious activity, such as backdoors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; all are consistent with the code’s content.\n   - The code is purely static constant definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Additional Comments:**\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is a benign constants module with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
