{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of constant string values representing various status codes and error messages for an API or SDK, likely used for error handling and response interpretation.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions at the beginning of the file, potentially imported or referenced elsewhere in the project.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as static values; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant variable definitions representing API response codes. It is typical in SDKs or API client libraries for standardizing response handling. There is no logic, user input processing, network communication, or data manipulation. The structure and content are standard and contain no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a constants module for API error codes. It poses no security threats or malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident.",
