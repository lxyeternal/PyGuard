  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign with no detected malware or malicious intent. Minor suspicion of obfuscation in Report 3 warrants a slight adjustment in its obfuscated score. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), and malware scores are justified at zero. No significant concerns are identified; continued monitoring is recommended."
