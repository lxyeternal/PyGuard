  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet is purely a header containing comments about licensing, copyright, and version information.  \n   There is no executable code, data input/output, or logic present. The `__version__` variable assignment is standard practice and harmless.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   All reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.  \n   The comments are standard licensing notices, with no embedded code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that this fragment is benign and purely metadata.  \n   No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature of the snippet.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as non-executable metadata.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**:  \n   The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code's content. Given the absence of any executable logic or data handling, higher scores for malware or security risk would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — no obfuscation present; only comments and a variable assignment.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code fragment is a benign header containing licensing and version information, with no executable code or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the existing assessments: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
