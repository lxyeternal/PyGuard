  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and version declaration for a software package, likely a library or module.",
  "sources": "The source is the comments at the beginning of the file, which include licensing information and version number.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process data or execute functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code solely defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The file consists only of comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only license information, copyright notice, and a version string assignment. It does not include executable logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The presence of a version number and license comments is typical for open-source modules and poses no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata for a software package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
