{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a header or metadata section, containing licensing information and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments with licensing and copyright details, and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, since the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only licensing comments and a version variable",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with licensing comments and a version variable. No executable logic, data input/output, or dynamic behavior is present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected. The code's nature as a header or metadata fragment indicates it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing comments and a version variable. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
