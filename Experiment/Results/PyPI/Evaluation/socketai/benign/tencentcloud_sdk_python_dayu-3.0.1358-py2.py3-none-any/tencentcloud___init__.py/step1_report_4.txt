{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a licensing and version declaration for a Python package or module, primarily providing metadata information.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading mechanisms are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and metadata assignments with no executable logic or data handling. The comments indicate a licensing agreement and copyright notice but do not perform any operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with licensing and copyright comments, version declaration, and no executable logic. It does not include data processing, input/output operations, or any suspicious constructs. The presence of license comments and version information is typical for open-source or licensed software and poses no security concern. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign header containing licensing and version information. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
