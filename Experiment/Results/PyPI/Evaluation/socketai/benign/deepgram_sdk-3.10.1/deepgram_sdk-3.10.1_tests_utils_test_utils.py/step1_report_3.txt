  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and tests for handling query parameters, directory creation, and metadata file operations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the URLs in get_query_params and the file paths provided to save/read functions.",
  "sinks": "Data written to and read from filesystem files; no untrusted external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Query parameters are extracted from URLs; data is written to and read from files; test assertions evaluate correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code performs standard test operations with no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly contains test functions utilizing utilities for URL parsing, directory creation, and file I/O. It uses pytest for testing, with no signs of malicious activity. All data flows are limited to local file operations or safe parsing of URLs. No external network or system commands are invoked. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected. The code's purpose appears to be standard testing of utility functions, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for utility functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. It operates entirely within local scope, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
