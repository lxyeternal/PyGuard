  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions related to URL parsing, directory creation, and metadata file handling.",
  "sources": "Input is from test parameters and function arguments within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; all functions perform local file operations or assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from test inputs to functions, which process and verify data locally; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for unit testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and defines several test functions for utility modules. These tests validate functions that parse query parameters, create directories, save/read metadata as strings or bytes, and check string matching. The functions seem standard, with no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The code performs typical test assertions and error handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present. Overall, this appears to be normal testing code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for utility functions, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on local data and does not perform any suspicious activities. There is no indication of malware or security vulnerabilities in this code.",
