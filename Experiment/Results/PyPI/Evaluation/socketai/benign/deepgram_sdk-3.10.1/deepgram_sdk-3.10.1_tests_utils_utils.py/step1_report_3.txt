{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL query parameter extraction, directory creation, and reading/writing metadata files, along with a string comparison failure handler.",
  "sources": "User-provided URL in get_query_params, filename and data parameters in save_metadata_bytes, save_metadata_string, read_metadata_string, read_metadata_bytes.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (create_dirs, open/write/read), console output in string_match_failure.",
  "flows": "URL input -> get_query_params; filename + data input -> save_metadata_bytes/string; filename input -> read_metadata_string/bytes; string comparison results -> console output and potential exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Directory creation uses fixed permissions, which is acceptable. No obfuscated or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward utility tasks: extracting URL query parameters, creating directories with specific permissions, saving and reading metadata to/from files, and comparing strings with visual output. The code relies on standard Python libraries, and all data handling appears safe. No user input is directly executed or transmitted over the network. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It handles file operations and string comparison with no suspicious side effects.",
