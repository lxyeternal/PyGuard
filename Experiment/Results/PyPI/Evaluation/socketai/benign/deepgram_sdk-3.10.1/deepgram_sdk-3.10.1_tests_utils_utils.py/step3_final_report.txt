  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL parsing, directory creation, file read/write, and string comparison with debug output.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (url, filename, data, expected, actual)",
  "sinks": "Filesystem (open/write/read), console output (print)",
  "flows": "Input parameters used in functions; debug print statements output to console",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging in string_match_failure; no malicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions with no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The only side effect is debug print statements which could leak info if misused, but are not malicious. No suspicious data flows or external interactions are present. The functions perform file I/O and string operations securely, with directory permissions set to 0o700. The debug output in string_match_failure is benign but could leak info if exposed in production. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security concern related to debug output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is debug print statements that could leak information if misused, but this does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor info leakage potential. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
