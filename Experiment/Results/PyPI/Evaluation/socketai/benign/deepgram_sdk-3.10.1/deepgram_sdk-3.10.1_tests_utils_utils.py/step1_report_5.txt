  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL parsing, directory creation, and file read/write operations involving metadata as strings or bytes.",
  "sources": "URL string input in get_query_params; filename inputs in create_dirs, save_metadata_bytes, save_metadata_string, read_metadata_string, read_metadata_bytes.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (create_dirs, open/write/read), printing to stdout in string_match_failure.",
  "flows": "URL input -> get_query_params; filename input -> create_dirs -> file write/read; data -> save_metadata_bytes -> decode -> save_metadata_string; expected/actual strings -> string_match_failure (print and raise).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The only unusual behavior is the detailed string mismatch printing, which is for debugging purposes and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: get_query_params extracts query parameters from URLs, create_dirs ensures directory existence with permissions, save_metadata_bytes and save_metadata_string save data to files, and read_metadata functions retrieve file contents. The string_match_failure function compares two strings and highlights mismatched characters with colored output. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All file operations and string manipulations are straightforward and do not involve untrusted data sources beyond standard input parameters. The functions use standard Python libraries and perform common tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for handling URLs and file metadata operations. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. The only notable feature is the string comparison function, which is likely used for debugging or validation, not for malicious purposes.",
