{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL parameter extraction, directory creation, metadata file reading/writing, and string comparison with debugging output.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URL strings, filenames, and data passed to functions such as bytes or strings.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include file operations (open, write, read), and printing output to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from URL strings or input data into processing functions, then potentially into file I/O or console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on standard library functions without suspicious modifications. No network operations, remote data fetching, or system command execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward utility functions for string and file handling. The get_query_params function extracts URL parameters. Directory creation is performed securely. Metadata functions read/write files safely with UTF-8 encoding. The string_match_failure function compares two strings and outputs differences with color coding, raising an exception on mismatch. No external data inputs are processed insecurely, no dangerous system calls or network activities are present. The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe file operations, string processing, and logging for debugging purposes. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
