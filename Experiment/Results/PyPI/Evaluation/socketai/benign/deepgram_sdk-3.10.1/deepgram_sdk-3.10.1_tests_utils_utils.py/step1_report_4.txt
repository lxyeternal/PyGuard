  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL parsing, directory creation, and file read/write operations, primarily for handling metadata data in a file system.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, file system reads (open for reading), URL string input.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (save_metadata_string), directory creation, print statements for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input URL to get_query_params → Directory creation in create_dirs → Data decoded and saved in save_metadata_bytes → Files read in read_metadata_string and read_metadata_bytes. String mismatch reporting prints error info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Functions perform straightforward I/O and string operations without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions: get_query_params extracts query parameters from a URL; create_dirs creates directories with specific permissions; save_metadata_bytes and save_metadata_string save data to files; read_metadata_string and read_metadata_bytes read data from files; string_match_failure compares strings and prints differences with color highlighting. The code uses standard Python libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious obfuscation. No external inputs are used in a malicious manner; no data exfiltration, command injection, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for handling file I/O and URL parsing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. It performs straightforward operations related to metadata management.",
