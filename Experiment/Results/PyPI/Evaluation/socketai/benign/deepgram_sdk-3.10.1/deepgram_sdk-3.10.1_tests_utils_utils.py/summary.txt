  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is debug print statements that could leak information if misused, but this does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor info leakage potential. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified."
