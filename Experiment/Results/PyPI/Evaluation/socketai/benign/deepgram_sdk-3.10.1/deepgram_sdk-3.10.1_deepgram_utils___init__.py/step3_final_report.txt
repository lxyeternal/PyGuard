  "purpose": "Setup for logging infrastructure using local module `.verboselogs` and constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from `.verboselogs` and standard `logging` module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; only import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and import statements for a local logging module and constants. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The import of `.verboselogs` is typical for modular logging setup. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for initializing logging infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate. The code fragment is a standard setup component with no security concerns.",
