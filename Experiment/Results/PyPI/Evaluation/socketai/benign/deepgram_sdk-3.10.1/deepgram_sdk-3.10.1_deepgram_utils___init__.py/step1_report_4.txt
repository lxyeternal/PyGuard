  "purpose": "Import logging and custom verbose logging levels for use in the SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging and custom log level definitions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; just importing modules and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements and license comments.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license comments, standard import statements for logging and a local module 'verboselogs'. It imports multiple logging levels and a logger class. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The imports are from local modules, which is typical in a package structure. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code appears present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of logging functionalities and custom log levels, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
