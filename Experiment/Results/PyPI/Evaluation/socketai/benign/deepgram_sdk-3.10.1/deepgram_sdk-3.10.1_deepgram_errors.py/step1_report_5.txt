  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for missing Deepgram API key errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input or reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard exception class definition with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, intended to handle missing API key errors. It includes a docstring, an __init__ method, and sets an attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network activity, credential theft, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. It is a straightforward class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues.",
