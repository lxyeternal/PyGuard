  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for missing Deepgram API key errors",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__) that accepts a message parameter",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "Input message to exception instantiation, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Standard exception class definition, no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class for handling API key errors, with a constructor that sets an error message. It uses standard Python class syntax and exception handling. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is present. No external data or network interactions are involved. The class appears to be a typical, benign component of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to define a specific exception for API key errors. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
