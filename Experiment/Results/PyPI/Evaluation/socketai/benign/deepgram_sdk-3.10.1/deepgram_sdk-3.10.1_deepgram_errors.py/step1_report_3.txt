  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for missing Deepgram API Key errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data reads; class definition only",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It includes a docstring and a constructor that calls the superclass constructor, setting an attribute 'name'. There are no data input points, external interactions, or potentially malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard exception class definition with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a specific exception related to API key errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and standard in nature.",
