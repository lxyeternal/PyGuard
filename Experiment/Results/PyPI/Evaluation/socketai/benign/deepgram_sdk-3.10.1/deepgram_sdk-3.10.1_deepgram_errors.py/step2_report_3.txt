  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:  \n   The code defines a custom exception class `DeepgramApiKeyError` with a constructor that accepts a message and sets a `name` attribute. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python. The code contains no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and follows standard Python practices. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The class is purely for exception handling related to missing API keys.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   - All reports have high confidence (1 or 1.0) that the code is benign and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no external data flows, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks.\n   - The purpose is consistent across reports: defining a custom exception class for missing API key errors.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security risk score**: All assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - **Risk score**: All assign 0, which is reasonable since there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or issues?**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n   - No changes are needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n6. **Overall assessment**:  \n   - The code is a standard, benign exception class.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- The code should be considered safe and not a supply chain threat.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
