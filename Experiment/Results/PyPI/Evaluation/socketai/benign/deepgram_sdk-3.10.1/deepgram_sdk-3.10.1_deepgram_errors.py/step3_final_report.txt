  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling missing Deepgram API key errors.",
  "sources": "The class accepts a message parameter in its constructor; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input message flows into the exception object during instantiation; no external flows or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "The setting of 'self.name' is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python custom exception class with a constructor that sets a message and an attribute 'name'. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports confirm its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
