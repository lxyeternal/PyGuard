  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for missing Deepgram API Key errors",
  "sources": "Class constructor and attribute assignment within the DeepgramApiKeyError class",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs are present in this code",
  "flows": "The code flows from class definition to exception raising when used in other parts of a program, but no direct data flow is present here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definition",
  "analysis": "This is a simple class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from Exception. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose, and an __init__ method that calls the superclass constructor with a message. There are no inputs, outputs, data leaks, external data interactions, or malicious behaviors present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
