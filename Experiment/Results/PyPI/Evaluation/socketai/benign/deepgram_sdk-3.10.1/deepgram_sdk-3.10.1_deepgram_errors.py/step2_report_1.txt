  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code Flaws**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data handling. The code is standard Python exception class code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   The class is simple and correctly implemented. The only minor point is the setting of `self.name` in the constructor, which is not a typical pattern for custom exceptions in Python, but it doesn't introduce any security risk or malfunction. Usually, custom exceptions inherit from `Exception` and pass messages to the superclass; setting an additional attribute like `self.name` is not standard but also not harmful.\n\n3. **Score Justification**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This is correct; no malicious code is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not introduce any security risk, as it is just a custom exception class.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n   All reports correctly dismiss any security concern based on the code's simplicity. There are no external data flows, no network interactions, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n   Since the code is a simple exception class, the only possible concern could be if the class were used maliciously elsewhere, but the reports focus solely on this snippet, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
