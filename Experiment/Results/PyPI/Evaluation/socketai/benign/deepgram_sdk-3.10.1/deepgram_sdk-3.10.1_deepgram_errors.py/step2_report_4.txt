  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a custom exception class `DeepgramApiKeyError`.\n- It inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n- The constructor accepts a message string and sets an attribute `name`.\n- The code includes a docstring explaining its purpose.\n- There are no external data flows, network interactions, or any malicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 in all reports. Since this is a benign exception class with no external interactions or vulnerabilities, a zero score is justified.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations:**\n- No evidence suggests any security risk beyond defining an exception.\n- The class does not handle sensitive data or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The attribute `name` is set to a static string, which is harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign custom exception class.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed reviews.",
