  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a module aggregator, importing internal SDK components.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external data flows are present.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK entry point, safe and clean.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, no external data inputs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK bootstrap, safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The slight risk score seems to reflect the minimal inherent risk in such module aggregators, which is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, no external data handling.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical SDK main module, safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The risk score is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Importing internal modules, no external data inputs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK initialization code, safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Import aggregator, no external input.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely structural code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward import structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is reasonable considering the nature of SDK entry points that don't handle untrusted data but are critical modules. These are low-risk and justified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Remain at 0, as no suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk of such structural code.\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The reports are consistent and well-justified.\n- No changes needed; the scores align with the code's nature.\n- The code is a typical, safe SDK entry point with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative assessment confirms the code's safety and benign purpose.",
