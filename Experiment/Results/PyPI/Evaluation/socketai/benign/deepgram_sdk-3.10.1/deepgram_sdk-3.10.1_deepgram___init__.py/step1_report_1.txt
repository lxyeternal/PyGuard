{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point and module aggregator for the Deepgram SDK, importing various classes, functions, and constants used throughout the SDK for speech recognition, transcription, management, and related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements that include internal modules (.utils, .client, .audio) and public classes/functions for SDK features; no external data inputs directly read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted external data; the code mainly imports and exposes internal components without executing or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code initializes module structure and imports components but does not execute runtime data flows or handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is purely structural, consisting of import statements, license comments, and constant definitions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a module aggregator and entry point for the SDK, importing a comprehensive set of classes and functions from internal modules. It includes license comments, version info, and configuration constants. All imports are standard and related to SDK functionality. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or hidden behaviors. The structure is typical for a large SDK, with clear organization and no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module initializer with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not process or handle untrusted data directly, nor does it contain any code that could be malicious or sabotage. The code appears safe and clean.",
