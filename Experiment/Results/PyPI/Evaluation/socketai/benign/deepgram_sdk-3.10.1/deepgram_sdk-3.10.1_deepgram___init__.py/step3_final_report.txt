{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point and module aggregator for the Deepgram SDK, importing a comprehensive set of classes, functions, and constants from internal modules to expose SDK functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads license comments, version info, and imports from internal modules; it does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data processing; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or external data flows are present; the code is static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and structural.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module initializer, importing internal components for SDK use. It contains license info, versioning, and extensive imports but no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for SDK entry points, and the code is clean and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK bootstrap module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is purely structural, serving as an organized import hub for SDK components.",
