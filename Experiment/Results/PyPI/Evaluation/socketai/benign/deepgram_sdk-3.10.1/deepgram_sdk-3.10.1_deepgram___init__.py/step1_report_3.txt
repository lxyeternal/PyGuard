{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for the Deepgram SDK, importing various modules, classes, and functions related to speech recognition, text-to-speech, and API management for use in applications.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data is imported from internal modules or standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; the code mainly imports classes and functions without executing external or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up module imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The only data defined are version info and imported constants.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a structured import hub for various SDK components, including client classes, response types, error classes, and audio utilities. There is no code execution beyond importing modules. It includes licensing and version metadata. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The structure is typical for an SDK main module, with clear and standard import patterns. No signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK bootstrap file with no indications of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks. It merely organizes and exposes SDK components for external use.",
