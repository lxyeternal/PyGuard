  "purpose": "SDK manages client classes, versioning, configuration, and routing for Deepgram API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, internal class variables (_parent, version), import statements for dynamic module loading.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of version-specific client classes via import_module, method calls, class instantiations.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from env/config -> setting internal variables -> constructing import paths -> dynamic import -> class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal variables (_parent, version) for dynamic import, which could be risky if influenced externally, but currently controlled within the SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code employs controlled dynamic import mechanisms based on internal state, typical for SDK version management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The import paths are constructed from internal variables, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution. Proper error handling and deprecation warnings are present. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or sabotage. The dynamic import is standard and controlled, with no external influence on the variables used for module paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK entry point with controlled dynamic imports, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score (~0.2) is justified given the internal control of import paths. No evidence of malware or sabotage detected.",
