  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, dynamic import mechanisms, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code's behavior:**\n- It manages SDK client instantiation, configuration, and version handling.\n- Uses environment variables and config objects for API keys.\n- Implements dynamic module importing via `import_module` based on internal parameters (`_parent`, `version`).\n- Contains deprecated methods that return client instances.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or evident malicious logic.\n- The dynamic import paths are constructed from internal variables, reducing risk but requiring careful control.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Presence of malicious code / backdoors**\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.\n- Dynamic import is based on internal variables, not user input, which is typical for SDK version management.\n- No signs of code injection, system calls, or data exfiltration.\n- Deprecated methods are harmless and merely return class instances.\n\n#### **Dynamic import mechanism**\n- The `Version.v()` method constructs import paths like `deepgram.clients.{parent}.v{version}.{filename}`.\n- Since `_parent` and `version` are controlled internally, the risk of malicious module injection is minimal.\n- If external input could influence these variables, that could be a concern, but in the current context, they are internal.\n\n#### **Potential vulnerabilities**\n- The only concern is if external input influences `_parent` or `version`, leading to arbitrary code execution. However, in the current code, these are set internally or via controlled methods.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n#### **Security implications**\n- The code is a standard SDK setup, with safe practices for dynamic module loading.\n- API keys are retrieved securely from environment variables or passed configs.\n- No suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores and justification:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Comments |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | No malicious activity; dynamic import is typical SDK behavior. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | Same as above; no malicious behavior, safe reflection. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | Standard SDK initialization; dynamic import controlled. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | Typical SDK pattern; no malicious signs. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | Well-structured, safe dynamic loading. |\n\n**Note:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, typical for SDK dynamic import patterns, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the consistent analysis across all reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2**\n\nThese reflect the low likelihood of malicious activity but acknowledge the inherent risks in dynamic module loading if external input were compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code appears to be a well-structured, standard SDK implementation with controlled dynamic imports and no malicious behavior. No security risks or sabotage are evident. The only potential concern would be if external input influences internal variables controlling module paths, but within the current scope, this risk is minimal.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2",
