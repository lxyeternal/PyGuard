{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python SDK for interacting with the Deepgram API, providing various client classes, routing mechanisms, and version management features.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv('DEEPGRAM_API_KEY')), import statements, class constructors, property methods",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of client classes (e.g., ManageClient, SelfHostedClient, AsyncManageClient), dynamic import of modules and classes, logging outputs",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment/config -> property methods for clients -> dynamic import and instantiation of version-specific classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Dynamic import based on version string is typical for SDK version management; no obfuscated code detected; no suspicious network activity or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages client class instantiation and versioning for the SDK. It retrieves API keys from environment variables or config objects, uses dynamic imports to load specific version modules, and instantiates classes accordingly. The dynamic import mechanism is common in SDKs to handle multiple API versions, not malicious. Logging is used for traceability. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK for managing API clients with versioning support. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic import, which is typical in SDK version management and not indicative of malicious intent.",
