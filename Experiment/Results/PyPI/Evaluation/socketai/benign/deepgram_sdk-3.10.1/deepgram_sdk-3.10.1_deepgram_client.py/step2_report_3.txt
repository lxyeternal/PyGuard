  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security concerns, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a Python SDK entry point for Deepgram, managing client class instantiation, versioning, configuration, and routing.\n- It uses dynamic import (`import_module`) based on internal parameters (`_parent`, `version`) to load version-specific classes.\n- API keys are sourced from environment variables or configuration objects.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The dynamic import mechanism is typical for SDKs supporting multiple API versions.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** SDK main interface, version management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, dynamic import is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The dynamic import is controlled and standard. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** SDK with versioned client class loading.\n- **Findings:** Dynamic import based on internal variables; safe practices; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The reflection via `import_module` is standard for versioned SDKs. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** SDK initialization, version management.\n- **Findings:** Controlled dynamic import, no secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The dynamic import is based on internal class variables, not user input, reducing risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** SDK client setup, version handling.\n- **Findings:** Use of importlib for dynamic class loading; controlled via internal state; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The dynamic import is controlled and standard.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SDK client library, version management.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code; dynamic import is controlled; no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.95\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard for SDKs supporting multiple versions.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (~0.2), reflecting potential concerns with dynamic import mechanisms, but these are standard and controlled within the SDK.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, typical SDK version management risk)\n\n**These scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.**\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a well-structured, standard SDK entry point that employs dynamic imports for version management in a controlled manner. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The minor security concern is the use of dynamic import paths, but given the internal control of parameters, this is not a significant risk.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThese reflect a low-security risk, with no malicious intent or behavior detected.",
