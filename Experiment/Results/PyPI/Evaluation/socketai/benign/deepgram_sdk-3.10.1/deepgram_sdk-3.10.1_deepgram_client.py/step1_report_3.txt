{
  "purpose": "This code defines the main entry point for the Deepgram SDK, handling client instantiation, configuration, and API version management.",
  "sources": "API key from environment variables or constructor parameters; import statements for various client modules.",
  "sinks": "Class instantiations for API clients, dynamic import of version-specific modules, configuration setup.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval → class instantiation → dynamic import based on version → client object creation.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import in 'Version.v' method could potentially be manipulated if user input is compromised, but it's controlled via internal class logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes the SDK, manages configuration, and dynamically loads version-specific client classes. The dynamic import uses internal class variables to construct import paths, which appears controlled and not externally manipulated. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network actions are present. The deprecation warnings and exception handling are standard practices. Overall, the code follows normal SDK initialization patterns, with safe dynamic module loading and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard SDK entry point with proper configuration handling and dynamic module import. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The dynamic import could be a minor concern if user input could influence '_parent' or 'version', but within the current scope, it seems controlled. Overall, no malicious activity or sabotage detected.",
