  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**  \n**Purpose:** SDK manages clients, versioning, and configuration.  \n**Key points:** Uses environment variables, dynamic import based on version, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.  \n**Assessment:** The dynamic import mechanism is typical for SDK version management. No suspicious code or backdoors detected. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the controlled dynamic import. Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK code.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n**Purpose:** SDK entry point, managing client classes and versions.  \n**Key points:** Uses dynamic import with internal variables, no hardcoded secrets, proper error handling, no malicious behaviors.  \n**Assessment:** Dynamic import is controlled and typical for such SDKs. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation. Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n**Purpose:** SDK client interface, handling configuration and version management.  \n**Key points:** Uses internal variables for dynamic import, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network or system calls, proper error handling.  \n**Assessment:** The controlled dynamic import and internal logic reduce risk. No malicious behavior detected. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK initialization code.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n**Purpose:** SDK client setup, version management, configuration.  \n**Key points:** Dynamic import based on internal state, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.  \n**Assessment:** The dynamic import is controlled and typical for SDK version handling. No malicious activity observed. Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low security risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n**Purpose:** SDK client library, managing various services and dynamic version loading.  \n**Key points:** Controlled dynamic import, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.  \n**Assessment:** The dynamic import is internally controlled, and no signs of malicious code are present. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe SDK code.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm standard SDK code with dynamic imports for versioning.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or malicious patterns observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (~0.2), justified by the controlled dynamic import and standard practices.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the use of dynamic import based on internal variables, but these are controlled within the SDK and not influenced by external user input, mitigating risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to dynamic import, but controlled and standard in SDKs)\n\nThis code appears to be a typical, well-structured SDK with version management, safe dynamic imports, and no malicious behavior. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The overall security posture of this code is sound based on the provided reports.",
