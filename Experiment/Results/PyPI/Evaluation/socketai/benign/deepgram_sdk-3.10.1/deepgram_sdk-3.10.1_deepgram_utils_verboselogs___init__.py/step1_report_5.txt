{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom logging levels and a custom logger class to extend Python's standard logging module with additional log levels and methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from module constants (level values, log level names), and from the logging module's functions and classes, especially during the registration of custom log levels and logger instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with logging system functions to output logs; no data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Custom log levels are added to the logging module, then the VerboseLogger class uses these levels to log messages. The install() function sets VerboseLogger as the default logger class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard logging extension tasks with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with defining additional log levels (NOTICE, SPAM, SUCCESS, VERBOSE) and registering them with the logging module. It then defines a function to add custom levels and a function to install a custom logger class. The VerboseLogger class extends the standard Logger to include methods for logging at the new levels. All operations are related to configuring and extending logging functionalities. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or external communications. The code appears to be a legitimate extension of Python's logging system for more granular log levels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of Python's logging module to include custom log levels and a custom logger class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. It is safe and intended solely for enhanced logging capabilities.",
