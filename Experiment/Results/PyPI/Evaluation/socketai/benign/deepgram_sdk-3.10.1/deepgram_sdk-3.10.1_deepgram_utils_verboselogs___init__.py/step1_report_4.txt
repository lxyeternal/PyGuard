{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom log levels for Python's logging module, including their numeric values, and implements a custom logger class with additional methods for these levels. It also provides functions to install this logger class as the default and to add new log levels dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined constants (log level values), function parameters (name, value, msg, args, kw), and imports modules (logging).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present; no untrusted data handling or external connections occur.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code sets up logging levels and a custom logger class, with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for extending Python's logging module; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom logging levels (NOTICE, SPAM, SUCCESS, VERBOSE) with specific numeric values positioned between standard levels. It provides functions to add new log levels dynamically and to install a custom logger class (VerboseLogger) that supports methods for these additional levels. The class constructor initializes the logger and assigns the parent logger. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive information processing is present. The code's structure and logic are consistent with typical logging extension practices and do not show signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of Python's logging framework, adding custom log levels and a custom logger class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely to improve logging capabilities and configuration.",
