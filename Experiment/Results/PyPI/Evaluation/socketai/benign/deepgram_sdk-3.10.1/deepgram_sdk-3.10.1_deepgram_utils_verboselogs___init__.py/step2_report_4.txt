  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines custom log levels (NOTICE, SPAM, SUCCESS, VERBOSE) with specific numeric values.\n- It registers these levels with the Python logging module via `addLevelName`.\n- It defines a `VerboseLogger` class that extends `logging.Logger`, adding methods for these levels.\n- The `install()` function sets `VerboseLogger` as the default logger class.\n- The code is purely about extending logging functionality, with no external input/output, network communication, or data manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is standard for extending Python's logging module.\n\n- **Malicious or suspicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n- **External data sinks or inputs?**  \n  None. The code only defines constants, functions, and a class for logging purposes.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted data, handle external inputs, or perform any network/file operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Notes |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------|\n| 1-5     | 0       | 0            | 0              | All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard extension of logging. The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate. |\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nGiven the code's purpose and behavior, a **risk score of 0** is justified.  \n**Malware score:**  \nNo malicious activity detected, so **0** is appropriate.  \n**Obfuscated score:**  \nCode is clear and straightforward, so **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n- The code is a typical utility module for enhanced logging and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**My own assessment aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for extending logging capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard implementation for custom logging levels in Python. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
