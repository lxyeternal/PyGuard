{
  "purpose": "Define and register custom logging levels and a custom logger class for enhanced logging functionality in Python's logging module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'logging' module, defines constants for log levels, and functions like 'install()' and 'add_log_level()'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'logging.setLoggerClass()' to set 'VerboseLogger' as the default logger class; methods like '_log()' for logging messages.",
  "flows": "The 'install()' function sets the logger class; custom methods in 'VerboseLogger' use '_log()' with specific levels to log messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code straightforwardly extends logging levels and logger class.",
  "analysis": "The code adds custom log levels (NOTICE, SPAM, SUCCESS, VERBOSE) to the standard logging module, defines a subclass 'VerboseLogger' that supports these levels via custom methods, and provides functions to install this logger as the default. No input or external data sources are read, nor are any sinks or flows indicating malicious behavior. All functions and methods are standard for extending logging functionality. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extending Python's logging module with custom log levels and a custom logger class. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign module designed for enhanced logging.",
