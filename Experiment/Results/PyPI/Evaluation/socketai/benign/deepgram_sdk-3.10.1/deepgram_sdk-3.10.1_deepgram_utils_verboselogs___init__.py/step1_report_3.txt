{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom logging levels and a logger class supporting those levels for enhanced logging features in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own definitions of log levels, imports the logging module, and sets custom log levels via addLevelName. It also reads parameters for add_log_level().",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication. No file writing, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily internal, from the add_log_level() calls to setting attributes, and within the VerboseLogger methods calling self._log() with level constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. All code functions relate to setting and extending logging levels.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly defines custom logging levels, integrates them into Python's logging system, and extends the Logger class to support new levels with custom methods. It uses standard practices, with no external data input or suspicious behavior. No external communication, data manipulation, or malicious constructs are present. The purpose appears to be augmenting logging capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extending Python's logging module with custom levels and a custom logger class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is a well-structured, legitimate utility code.",
