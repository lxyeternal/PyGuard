{
  "purpose": "Define and register custom logging levels and a logger class supporting those levels for enhanced logging features.",
  "sources": "The module imports the 'logging' standard library and defines constants, functions, and a class related to logging levels.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines constants and a class for logging purposes.",
  "flows": "The code adds new logging levels and provides methods to log messages at those levels; no external data flow or input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for extending logging capabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom logging levels (NOTICE, SPAM, SUCCESS, VERBOSE) and a VerboseLogger class that supports these levels. Functions add_log_level and install modify the standard logging module by adding new levels and setting the custom logger class. All operations are standard for extending logging functionality and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code appears purely focused on logging customization without any signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for adding custom log levels and a logger class to enhance Python's logging module. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility module for logging purposes.",
