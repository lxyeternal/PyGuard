  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Deepgram SDK Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads environment and system info; gathers package info and dependencies for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data leaks or external communications are performed within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, gathers environment info, and uses 'setuptools' to configure package setup without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including environment validation, file reading for descriptions, and dependency declarations. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to external servers, or manipulate data in a suspicious manner. All operations are typical for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python SDK package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
