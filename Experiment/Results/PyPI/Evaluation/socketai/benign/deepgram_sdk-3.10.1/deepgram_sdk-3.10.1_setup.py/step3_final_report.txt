  "purpose": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python SDK, performing environment checks, reading README for description, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file, checks Python version, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or file operations beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and sets package info; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious or security issues. It performs environment validation, reads static files, and defines dependencies in a standard manner. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not execute untrusted code, connect to external domains, or leak data. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. The overall security assessment is that this package is safe for use.",
