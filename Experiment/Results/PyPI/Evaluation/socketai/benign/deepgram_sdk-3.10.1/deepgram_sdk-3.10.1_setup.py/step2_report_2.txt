  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review of the Original Script:**\n\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for packaging a Python SDK.\n- It performs typical operations:\n  - Checks Python version (`< 3.10`).\n  - Reads `README.md` for long description.\n  - Defines package metadata and dependencies.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or suspicious logic are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code follows standard patterns and best practices for Python packaging.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the script is a typical setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- They mention the absence of untrusted data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The analysis is consistent, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n\n3. **Logical and Score Justification:**\n\n- The **malware score of 0** is appropriate given the lack of any malicious indicators.\n- The **security risk score of 0** is justified as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The **risk score of 0** aligns with the above, indicating no security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Points of Concern?**\n\n- The only minor consideration is the environment check (`sys.version_info`)—a standard practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are observed.\n- No hidden behaviors or obfuscation are present.\n\n5. **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The provided code and reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final note:** Given the thorough review, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security concerns.",
