  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Deepgram SDK Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, system info check, and package requirements.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling or external data processing beyond package requirements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The script only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: checks Python version, reads README for description, and specifies package dependencies. No user input, network calls, or data leaks are present. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python SDK package with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
