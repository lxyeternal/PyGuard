  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a set of configuration classes for the Deepgram SDK client.\n- It manages API keys, URLs, headers, options, and environment variables.\n- It reads environment variables for configuration, constructs headers, and validates API keys.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- The code adheres to standard practices for SDK configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors**\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Comments:** The code's purpose is configuration management; it handles API keys and environment variables securely.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n\n#### **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous logic.\n- **Comments:** The code is straightforward, with proper handling of environment variables and API keys.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n#### **Use of Environment Variables**\n- **Findings:** Standard practice; environment variables are used for configuration.\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious manipulation; typical for SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Correctly assigned `securityRisk` low (around 0.1-0.2).\n\n#### **Obfuscation or Suspicious Logic**\n- **Findings:** No obfuscated code or complex logic.\n- **Comments:** The code is clear and maintainable.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is accurate.\n\n#### **Logging and Configuration Handling**\n- **Findings:** Logging levels are set via environment variables, which could leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but this is a common practice.\n- **Comments:** No security risk from logging as implemented.\n- **Scores:** Appropriately low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No malware or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly `0`, as code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable, reflecting minimal configuration risks.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns or Clarifications**\n- **Logging sensitive info:** While not malicious, verbose logging of environment variables could leak secrets if logs are exposed. This is a configuration concern, not a malware issue.\n- **Environment variable handling:** Standard practice; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\n\n**Based on the reports and code review:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**             | No malicious code or behavior present.                         |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**             | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.               |\n| Risk           | **0.1 - 0.2**     | Minimal configuration risk; standard environment variable use.|\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' evaluations are accurate. The code does not exhibit malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. Continue monitoring for logging practices that might expose secrets, but from a security perspective, the code is sound.",
