{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes for a Deepgram SDK client, managing API keys, URLs, headers, options, and environment variable integration for secure API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, DEEPGRAM_HOST, DEEPGRAM_HEADER_X, DEEPGRAM_PARAM_X), input parameters (api_key, url, headers, options).",
  "sinks": "Authorization header (potentially exposes API key if misused), logging outputs, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during initialization to set API keys and headers, which are then used in HTTP requests; API key flows from env or input to headers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code behaviors detected; standard environment variable usage, string manipulations, and logging. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys by sourcing them from environment variables or parameters. Headers are constructed dynamically, including authorization tokens. URL handling prepends 'https://' if missing. Logging levels are configurable via environment variables with string matching. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are present. It correctly avoids hardcoded secrets and employs standard security practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration management module with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It securely handles sensitive information and provides flexible environment-based configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
