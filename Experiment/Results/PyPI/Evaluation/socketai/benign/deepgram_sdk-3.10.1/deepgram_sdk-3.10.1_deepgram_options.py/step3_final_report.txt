  "purpose": "Configuration management for Deepgram SDK client, handling API keys, URLs, headers, and environment variables securely.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, DEEPGRAM_HOST, DEEPGRAM_HEADER_X, DEEPGRAM_PARAM_X), constructor parameters, user input for API key and headers.",
  "sinks": "Headers constructed with Authorization token, URL used for API interactions, logging output (potential info leakage if misconfigured).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and constructor arguments feed into header and URL setup; headers used in API requests; logging levels influence output verbosity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious routines detected. Standard environment variable handling and logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration securely, sourcing API keys and other parameters from environment variables or inputs. It constructs headers with proper authorization tokens, prepends 'https://' to URLs if missing, and sets logging levels based on environment variables. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns identified. The environment variable handling is standard, and logging practices are typical, with a minor note on potential info leakage if logs are exposed, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The scores are justified and accurate, reflecting minimal security risk.",
