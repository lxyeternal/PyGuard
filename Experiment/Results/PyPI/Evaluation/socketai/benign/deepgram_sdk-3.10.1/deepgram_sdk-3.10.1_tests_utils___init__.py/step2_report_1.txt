  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: a license header and import statements from a local `.utils` module.\n- No executable logic, data flows, or runtime behaviors are present.\n- The code is standard for a modular SDK, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The only concern might be whether the imported functions could be used maliciously elsewhere, but this is speculative without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code snippet contains only import statements and licensing comments. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data flows, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments.\n- The imported functions (`get_query_params`, `create_dirs`, `save_metadata_bytes`, etc.) are typical utility functions and do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and part of a larger SDK.\n- They assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- They assume that the utility functions are safe because they are only imported and not used here. While this is reasonable, it is worth noting that the functions' implementations could be checked if available, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable since the code itself does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, higher scores are unjustified.\n- The minimal security risk (0.1) in some reports might be a conservative buffer, but given the code snippet, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Consistency with the code:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet's benign nature.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound, noting that this is a fragment and that the utility functions could be used maliciously elsewhere, but that is outside this scope.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, standard import statement with no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and cautious.\n- No changes needed; scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, and the security posture is minimal risk.\n\n**Note:** If the implementation of the imported functions were available, a deeper review could be performed, but based solely on this snippet, the conclusion remains unchanged.",
