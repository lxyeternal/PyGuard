  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is purely import statements with licensing comments.\n- No dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The code is part of a larger SDK, likely for Deepgram, focusing on utility functions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as part of an SDK, importing utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states the code is benign, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code as part of Deepgram SDK, importing from a local module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks or data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is low but not zero. Since the code only contains import statements, this is reasonable. The malware score remains 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar to previous reports, it emphasizes that the code is only import statements, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same conclusion: benign import statements, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Again, highlights the benign nature of the code, focusing on import statements.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The scores assigned (mostly 0 or 0.1 for securityRisk, and 0 for malware) are appropriate given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty based on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code is only import statements with no processing, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall Risk Scores:** Should stay at 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (due to the minimal nature of the code)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's safety and the appropriateness of the current scoring.",
