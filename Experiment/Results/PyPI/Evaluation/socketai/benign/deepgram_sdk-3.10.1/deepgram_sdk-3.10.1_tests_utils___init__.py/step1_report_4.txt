{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports utility functions for handling query parameters, directory creation, and metadata reading/writing, likely as part of a larger SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local utility module (.utils), which is used for various utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Not enough code is provided to determine data flows; the fragment only shows import statements without any runtime behavior or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs are present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement section from a Python module. It imports utility functions that likely perform common tasks such as handling query parameters, creating directories, and reading/writing metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no embedded network activity, no obfuscated code, and no anomalies. The content is standard for a modular SDK design. Given the limited scope, no malicious intent or security risks can be inferred from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a standard import block with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger, benign SDK module.",
