{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a SDK, likely providing utility functions for handling data, file operations, and metadata management.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local utils module: get_query_params, create_dirs, save_metadata_bytes, save_metadata_string, read_metadata_string, read_metadata_bytes, string_match_failure.",
  "sinks": "The functions imported are related to data handling and file operations, which could be sinks if they process untrusted data. However, the code itself does not show these functions being invoked or used.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in the provided snippet; it only shows import statements. Without actual usage, no source-to-sink flow can be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are visible in this snippet. The code contains standard licensing comments and benign import statements. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of comments and import statements from a local utils module. It does not execute any logic, process data, or perform operations that could be malicious. The imported functions seem to relate to data and metadata handling, typical in SDKs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be benign, serving as part of a utility module for an SDK. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
