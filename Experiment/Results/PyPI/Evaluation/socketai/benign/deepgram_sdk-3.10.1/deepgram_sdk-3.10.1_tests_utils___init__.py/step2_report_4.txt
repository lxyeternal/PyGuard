  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the provided code snippet, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a minimal header with licensing comments and import statements from a `.utils` module.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or runtime behavior is visible.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is limited to imports and comments, with no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- Some reports mention the potential for the imported functions to be malicious, but since the functions are only imported and not invoked here, this is speculative.\n- No report incorrectly attributes malicious intent or security risks to this fragment.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- **Confidence scores:** Range from 0.9 to 1, which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, matching the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0.1, indicating minimal risk, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk or malware scores**\n\n- All malware scores are 0, justified by the lack of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low, justified because the code only imports benign utility functions.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume that because the code only imports functions, it cannot be malicious. This is valid; however, the security of the overall system depends on the imported functions' implementation.\n- Since the code snippet does not include the implementation of these functions, we cannot assess their security, but based on this fragment alone, no issues are evident.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the benign assessment.\n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — The code is not malicious; only imports are present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal risk due to potential usage of imported functions, but this is standard for SDK import modules.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code snippet is a straightforward, benign header with licensing comments and import statements. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the potential that imported functions could be misused elsewhere, but this is standard in SDKs)\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the current analysis.",
