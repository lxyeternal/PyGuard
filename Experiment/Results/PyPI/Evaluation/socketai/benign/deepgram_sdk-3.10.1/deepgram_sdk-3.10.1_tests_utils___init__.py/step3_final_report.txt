{
  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments and import statements from a local utils module, serving as a module header or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the '.utils' module, which may read or handle data internally but are not invoked here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this fragment; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet; only static import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements for utility functions, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The imported functions are typical utilities and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. Given the absence of dynamic behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns, the code is benign. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is conservative; a score of 0 is more accurate based on this fragment. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module header with import statements, presenting no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 accurately reflect its safe nature.",
