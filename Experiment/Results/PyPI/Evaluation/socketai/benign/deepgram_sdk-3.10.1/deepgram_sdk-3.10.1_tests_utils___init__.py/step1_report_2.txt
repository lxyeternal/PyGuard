{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a SDK for Deepgram, likely providing utility functions related to file handling and metadata processing.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module named .utils, which may read data or perform file operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, system calls, or untrusted data handling are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly shown; only import statements are present, so no source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains only license headers and import statements from a local utility module. No malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior is evident. Since it is a partial snippet, it cannot be definitively said whether the utils module itself contains malicious code, but the presented code shows standard import patterns without any signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard boilerplate and import code from a utility module related to a Deepgram SDK. No malware or obfuscation is detected, and the security risk is minimal.",
