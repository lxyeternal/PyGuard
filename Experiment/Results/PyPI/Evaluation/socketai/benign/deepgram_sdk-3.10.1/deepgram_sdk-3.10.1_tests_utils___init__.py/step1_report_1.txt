{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or library, likely related to Deepgram's speech or audio processing, with utility functions imported for file handling, directory creation, and metadata management.",
  "sources": "Import from .utils module, which provides functions for querying, directory creation, and reading/writing metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided snippet; potential sinks could occur if imported functions are used with untrusted input elsewhere in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable here, as this code only contains import statements and comments without executable logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard licensing comments and straightforward import statements. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a standard header with licensing information and imports from a utility module. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Since it only imports functions and contains no other logic, there is no evidence of malicious intent. It is part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it shows no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, mainly consisting of licensing comments and a clean import statement from a utility module. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident in this fragment.",
