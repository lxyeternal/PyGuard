{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a larger SDK for Deepgram, providing utility functions for handling query parameters, directories, and metadata.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; imports functions from a local utils module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; no functions executing system commands or handling untrusted input directly",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow in this fragment; would depend on the usage of imported functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is limited to imports and comments, with no suspicious operations or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and import statements from a utils module, providing utility functions. There are no data manipulations, no input handling, no network operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The comments indicate licensing information and licensing details. Since the code snippet is only an import statement section, it does not present any security issues or malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement segment, part of a larger SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
