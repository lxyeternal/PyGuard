  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export script with licensing comments. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. The license comments are standard boilerplate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python module for exporting client classes with proper licensing headers. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
