  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific client classes and defines the public API for a Python package related to cloud catalog services.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with license headers, importing two classes, and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, user input, network activity, or data processing. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate it is benign. All provided reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are high, and no anomalies are detected. The code's purpose is purely organizational, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module for exporting client classes, with no malicious or security issues. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
