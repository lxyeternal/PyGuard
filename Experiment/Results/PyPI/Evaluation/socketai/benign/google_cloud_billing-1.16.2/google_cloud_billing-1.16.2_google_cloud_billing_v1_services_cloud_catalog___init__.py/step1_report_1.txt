  "purpose": "This code appears to define module imports and exports for a cloud catalog client library, likely used for interacting with a cloud service API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data processing occurs; no network, file, or data leakage points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely imports and exposes classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module export pattern, no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify exported classes. It adheres to standard Python package structure. No user input, no data processing, no network connections, and no sensitive information handling are present. The license header is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module definition file with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply exports classes for use elsewhere, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
