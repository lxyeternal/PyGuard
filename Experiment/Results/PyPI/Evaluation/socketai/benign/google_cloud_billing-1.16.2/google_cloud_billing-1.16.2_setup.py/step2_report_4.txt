  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script, reading version info from a file, reading README, discovering packages, and calling setup(). No suspicious or malicious code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues detected; malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, typical setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on version extraction and dependency constraints. No untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Standard, safe package setup.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—reading version, README, setting dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Typical setup script, no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same process, with mention of regex for version extraction, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0. The only slight concern is a security risk score of 0.1, possibly due to regex usage, but regex parsing version info from a file is standard practice.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign; the minor security risk score is likely overcautious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same standard setup pattern, no untrusted data or malicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports confirm the script is a standard setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the only mention is a negligible 0.1, which is likely an overcautious estimate related to regex parsing, but not indicative of any actual vulnerability.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on all reports, the code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The minor security risk score assigned in one report is unwarranted given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, considering the absence of actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
