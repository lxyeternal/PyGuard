  "purpose": "This code appears to be a license header and version declaration, likely part of a larger Python source file.",
  "sources": "The license comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license comments and a version string assignment; no suspicious or unusual activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a standard license header followed by a version assignment, both of which are common in open-source Python files. There are no functions, data processing, or other executable logic that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external data sources are present. The code is purely declarative and administrative in nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical license header and version declaration. No suspicious activity detected.",
