  "sources": "The version string assignment '__version__ = \"1.16.2\"' and the comment block containing licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header with a version string, containing no executable or sensitive logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores (1), and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely informational, and the content aligns with the assessments. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header and version declaration with no security issues. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
