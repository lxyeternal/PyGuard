  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license header and version declaration for a Python module, serving as metadata and licensing information.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only metadata and comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code contains only comments and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a standard license header and version declaration; no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical open-source license header followed by a version string declaration. There are no functions, input/output operations, or code execution segments. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The license and version information are standard for open-source projects. Based on the content, this is benign metadata only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard license header and version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It provides licensing information and versioning for the project without any suspicious or malicious content.",
