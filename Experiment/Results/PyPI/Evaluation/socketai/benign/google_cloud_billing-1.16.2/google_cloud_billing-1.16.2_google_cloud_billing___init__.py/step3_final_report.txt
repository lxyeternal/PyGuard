  "purpose": "This code serves as a static module that imports and re-exports classes, functions, and types from the Google Cloud Billing SDK, facilitating client code to access these components easily.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.billing_v1.services and types modules, reading license headers and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no output or network operations, only static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "N/A – static import/export without data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with license headers, version info, and import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup module with license headers, version declaration, and import statements from the Google Cloud Billing SDK. It defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. The code is static, well-structured, and typical for SDK modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The import statements are from well-vetted, publicly available SDK modules, and the code's purpose is to facilitate client access to SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK setup module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
