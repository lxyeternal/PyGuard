  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely metadata: licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version variable assignment.\n   - No executable code, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign metadata.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments of no anomalies, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent are justified given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code contains no executable logic or data flow that could introduce security risks.\n   - No need to elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as metadata.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is standard boilerplate metadata, with no security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Estimated scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as metadata-only, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
