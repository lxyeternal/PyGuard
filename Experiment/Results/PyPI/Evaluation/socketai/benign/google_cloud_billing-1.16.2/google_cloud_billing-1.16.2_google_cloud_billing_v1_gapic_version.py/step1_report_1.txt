  "sinks": "N/A (no data output or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, no source-to-sink pathways)",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license comments and version string; no suspicious or unusual code structures, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, a copyright notice, licensing terms, and a version variable assignment. There are no executable statements, no input/output handling, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The version string appears to follow semantic versioning. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata, licensing information, and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for open-source projects.",
