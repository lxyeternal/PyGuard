{
  "purpose": "This code serves as metadata for a Python package, including licensing information and a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments, license headers, and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as the code contains no executable or data flow components.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior. It is standard boilerplate metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is static and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
