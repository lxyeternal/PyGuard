  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and normalizing filesystem protocols and URIs, especially for compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from string arguments such as file paths or URIs, specifically in functions _match_protocol, get_upath_protocol, normalize_empty_netloc, and compatible_protocol.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful manner, such as network connections or file modifications. The functions primarily perform string parsing and validation.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched against regex patterns to extract protocols, then processed or validated for compatibility, with no direct data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses regex for pattern matching in a straightforward manner. Commented-out code is benign. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching to identify protocols in URIs and paths, normalizes paths for consistency, and checks protocol compatibility among multiple inputs. All functions operate on sanitized inputs with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. No network operations, data exfiltration, or command executions are present. The overall logic is simple, with no suspicious anomalies. The code's design aligns with standard URI and path handling routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for protocol parsing and normalization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and normalization without executing or exposing sensitive data or system commands.",
