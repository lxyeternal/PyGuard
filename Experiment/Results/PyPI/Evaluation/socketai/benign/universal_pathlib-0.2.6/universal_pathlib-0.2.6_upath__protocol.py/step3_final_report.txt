  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting, normalizing, and checking compatibility of protocols in file paths and URIs.",
  "sources": "Regex matching of input strings, attributes of path-like objects, and string conversions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; purely string and attribute manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input strings or path objects are matched against regex patterns; protocols are extracted and compared for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; commented-out code is benign and incomplete features.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard regex patterns for URI parsing, straightforward logic for protocol extraction and normalization, and simple compatibility checks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The functions operate on sanitized inputs, and the regex patterns are typical for URI handling. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. The commented-out code does not introduce vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is a benign utility module for protocol handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
