  "purpose": "Provide a deprecated alias for NotDirectoryError with a warning message.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a function for attribute access.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or write data externally.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ method that triggers a deprecation warning when 'NotDirectoryError' is accessed. It then returns the built-in 'NotADirectoryError'. If any other attribute is accessed, an AttributeError is raised. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is simple, using standard Python features without suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code only provides a deprecation warning for a specific attribute and returns a standard exception. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
