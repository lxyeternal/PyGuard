{
  "purpose": "To provide a deprecated alias for NotDirectoryError with a warning message.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only defines a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only raises warnings and returns a built-in exception.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically provides a deprecated attribute with a warning, which is normal for deprecation notices. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ method that intercepts attribute access on a module or class. When 'NotDirectoryError' is accessed, it issues a deprecation warning and returns the standard NotADirectoryError exception. If any other attribute is requested, it raises AttributeError. The purpose is to warn users about deprecation and redirect to the correct exception. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical deprecation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation warning implementation for a specific attribute. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply issues a warning when a deprecated attribute is accessed.",
