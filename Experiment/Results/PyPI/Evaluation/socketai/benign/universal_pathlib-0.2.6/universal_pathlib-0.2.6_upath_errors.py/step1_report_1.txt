  "purpose": "Provide a deprecated alias for NotDirectoryError with a warning message",
  "sources": "The function __getattr__ that intercepts attribute access for NotDirectoryError",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn call, which issues a deprecation warning",
  "flows": "Access to NotDirectoryError triggers __getattr__, which issues a warning and returns the error class",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ method to handle attribute access. When 'NotDirectoryError' is accessed, it issues a deprecation warning and returns the standard NotADirectoryError class. Otherwise, it raises AttributeError. No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or potentially malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is to guide users towards a newer exception class with a warning, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign deprecation warning mechanism with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
