{
  "purpose": "The code provides a deprecated alias for NotDirectoryError with a warning message.",
  "sources": "The code reads the attribute name being accessed via __getattr__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input (attribute access) flows through __getattr__ to return NotDirectoryError with a warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ function to handle dynamic attribute access. When 'NotDirectoryError' is accessed, it issues a deprecation warning and returns the NotADirectoryError exception class. If any other attribute is accessed, it raises AttributeError. The implementation is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The warning message is a standard deprecation notice. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deprecation helper that issues a warning when a deprecated attribute is accessed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
