{
  "purpose": "Provide a deprecation warning for the attribute 'NotDirectoryError' and redirect it to the built-in 'NotADirectoryError'.",
  "sources": "Attribute access to 'NotDirectoryError' triggers the __getattr__ method.",
  "sinks": "The code issues a warning and returns a class; no untrusted data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Accessing 'NotDirectoryError' triggers __getattr__, which issues a warning and returns 'NotADirectoryError'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of a deprecation warning pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ method that intercepts attribute access. When 'NotDirectoryError' is requested, it issues a DeprecationWarning and returns the standard 'NotADirectoryError'. For other attributes, it raises AttributeError. The code is simple, with no external dependencies, no input/output, and no obfuscation. All reviews agree that the code is benign, serving solely as a deprecation helper. No suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign purpose. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks, and the purpose is to inform users about deprecation, a common and safe pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for issuing a deprecation warning for an attribute. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements and poses no security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
