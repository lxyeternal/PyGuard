{
  "purpose": "Provide a deprecated alias for NotDirectoryError with a warning message",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' attribute during attribute access to determine if it matches 'NotDirectoryError'",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "The source is the attribute access (__getattr__), which, if matched, issues a warning and returns NotADirectoryError",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward deprecation warning mechanism",
  "analysis": "The code defines a __getattr__ function to intercept attribute access. When 'NotDirectoryError' is accessed, it issues a deprecation warning and returns NotADirectoryError. If other attributes are accessed, it raises AttributeError. No untrusted data handling, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are present. The function's purpose is to notify users of deprecated usage. There are no suspicious or malicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple deprecation warning wrapper for an attribute access. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign code segment intended for backward compatibility notifications.",
