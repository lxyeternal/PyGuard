  "purpose": "Utility class for wrapping filesystem stat information, providing compatibility with os.stat_result and fsspec info dicts.",
  "sources": "Info dicts, os module, environment variables (indirectly via info), data conversions.",
  "sinks": "Accessors for stat fields, warnings for data issues, no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from info dicts into class attributes, with conversions for timestamps and type inference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; standard warnings for data issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for filesystem metadata. It performs data wrapping, type conversions, and provides attribute accessors. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Warnings are benign and related to data handling. The code does not obfuscate or hide functionality, and all patterns are standard for such utility classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused implementation for filesystem stat info, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use.",
