{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime operations beyond version assignment.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'. No input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard version metadata, with a typical conditional type checking structure.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables with static data and uses a conditional block for type checking imports, which is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious logic, and no external data processing, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version metadata definition typical of package setup scripts, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
