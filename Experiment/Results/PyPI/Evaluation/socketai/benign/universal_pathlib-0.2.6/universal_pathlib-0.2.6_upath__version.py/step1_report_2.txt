  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or external data handling; no sinks that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples to version variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of standard versioning conventions and auto-generated comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version info module, auto-generated by setuptools_scm, containing static version data. It uses conditional typing import, which is standard for type hinting. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version module with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
