{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm to manage versioning information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, importing TYPE_CHECKING for type hints",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no data leaks or command execution points",
  "flows": "No external data flow; straightforward variable assignments and imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of standard versioning conventions",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated versioning file using setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports type annotations under TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern. The version string and tuple are hardcoded but are standard in version management files. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code solely manages version information without any external data sources or execution flows that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated versioning helper file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
