{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and includes type annotations for development purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and type checking imports",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a conditional block based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is typical for type hints; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables with hardcoded values. It includes a conditional import for type annotations that does not execute at runtime. There are no dynamic code executions, external data sources, or any suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition script generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
