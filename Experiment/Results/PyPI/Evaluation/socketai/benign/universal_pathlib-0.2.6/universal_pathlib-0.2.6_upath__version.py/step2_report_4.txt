  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is benign, serving only version info, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Verification:** The code only assigns static version strings and uses a conditional for type hints; no external input, no network activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code is straightforward, standard boilerplate, with no security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing auto-generated nature and benign behavior.  \n- **Verification:** Same as above, no dynamic behavior, no external data, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard version management code, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Verification:** No external inputs, no code execution beyond static assignment, standard pattern.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, benign version info code.  \n- **Verification:** No suspicious logic or external data handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, benign static version data.  \n- **Verification:** No external inputs, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely static version info with no signs of malware.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and auto-generated boilerplate.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the static nature and lack of external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0 for all.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is standard version management boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.  \n- Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified and appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
