{
  "purpose": "Static version information assignment generated by setuptools_scm, serving as metadata for the package version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version info module with static assignments and a conditional type hint import. It contains no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely to define version metadata, which it does statically and safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for version management, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscated code score is 0, consistent with the code's static and straightforward structure.",
