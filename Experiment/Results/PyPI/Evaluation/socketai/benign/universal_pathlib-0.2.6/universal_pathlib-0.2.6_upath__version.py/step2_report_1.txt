  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated by setuptools_scm, which is standard for version management.\n- The code is static, with no external inputs, network activity, or data processing.\n- The conditional `if TYPE_CHECKING:` is a common pattern for type hints, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present.\n- All reports assign a version string and tuple statically, with no data flows from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard version info code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign auto-generated version module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Typical versioning code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard version definition, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Benign, static version info, no runtime operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are any issues present?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated boilerplate.\n- **Any anomalies or flaws?** No. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores justification:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, as there's no external data or potential attack vector. Obfuscated is 0, no code obfuscation present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjustments:** None needed; all scores are reasonable.\n- **Additional insights:** Given the code's simplicity and purpose, the risk levels are correctly low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0**     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, auto-generated version info module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
