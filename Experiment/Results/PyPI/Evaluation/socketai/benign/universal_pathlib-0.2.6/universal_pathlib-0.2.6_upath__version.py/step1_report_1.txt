{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Version string assignment (__version__ and version), type checking conditional block",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned directly to __version__ and version variables; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of type checking conditional, but no malicious or unusual code patterns present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables based on static data, with a conditional import for type hints that does not execute at runtime. No external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. It appears to be standard version management boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define version information with no malicious intent or security risks.",
