{
  "purpose": "Implements a topological sort algorithm to determine an order of items based on dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input data as a dictionary of items and their dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leak points; purely computational with internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data is read into the function, processed to determine dependency order, and output as ordered sets or lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be a standard implementation of topological sorting with comments and licensing.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing and descriptive comments, defines a custom error class, and implements topological sort functions. The main functions process input dependency data, handle self-dependencies, and detect circular dependencies. The logic uses standard set operations and controlled iteration. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is consistent with a typical algorithm implementation and contains no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of a topological sort algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears to be safe and suitable for use in dependency resolution tasks.",
