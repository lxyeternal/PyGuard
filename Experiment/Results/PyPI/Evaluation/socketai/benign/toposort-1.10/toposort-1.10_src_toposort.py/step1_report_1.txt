  "purpose": "Implementing a topological sort algorithm to resolve dependency ordering in directed graphs.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; data is provided via function arguments (dictionaries).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or output data; the code processes dependency data internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (dependency dictionary) -> processing within toposort functions -> yields sorted sets or lists.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, contains no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency resolution algorithm with proper handling of edge cases, including empty input and circular dependencies. It copies input data to prevent mutation, identifies items with no dependencies, and iteratively yields sets of ready items. The error handling for circular dependencies is explicit and informative. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual patterns. No external data access or network activity. Overall, the code appears standard and benign, focused solely on dependency resolution logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements a standard topological sort algorithm with appropriate safety measures and clear logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is safe and suitable for use in dependency management tasks.",
