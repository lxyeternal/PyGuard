{
  "purpose": "Implement a topological sort algorithm to process dependencies and detect circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data parameter 'data' in 'toposort' and 'toposort_flatten' functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not send untrusted data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through dependency resolution in 'toposort' to yield ordered sets or lists in 'toposort_flatten'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow; the code is straightforward algorithm implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a dependency resolution via topological sorting with clear logic for handling dependencies and detecting circular dependencies. It copies and modifies input data to avoid side-effects, identifies items with no dependencies, and raises an error if circular dependencies are found. No external network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present. The only notable aspect is the raising of a custom exception for cycles, which is part of normal operation and not malicious. The code is well-structured, documented, and appears to be a standard implementation of a topological sort algorithm.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a topological sort with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is intended for dependency resolution and includes proper error handling for circular dependencies. There are no security risks or malware indications in this code.",
