{
  "purpose": "Implements a topological sort algorithm to order dependencies based on their dependencies, primarily for use in dependency resolution or task ordering.",
  "sources": "Reads the input dictionary 'data' containing dependency relations; accesses class attributes; processes sets and dictionary items.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not perform any data output to external systems, network communication, or file writing.",
  "flows": "Input data is copied and processed internally; no untrusted data flows to external sinks; no network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard data structures and algorithms for dependency sorting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency sorting utility with clear licensing and documentation. It handles input copying, dependency resolution, and cycle detection through a class that raises exceptions on circular dependencies. No malicious patterns, external data handling, or obfuscated code features are present. The code operates solely on in-memory data structures and logic for topological sorting, with no side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of a topological sort algorithm with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module with no suspicious behavior.",
