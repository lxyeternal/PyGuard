{
  "purpose": "Implements a topological sort algorithm for dependency resolution, primarily used for ordering items based on dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads dependency data from input dictionary 'data' in toposort and toposort_flatten functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code does not write or send data externally or process untrusted input in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Input dependency dictionary flows into the toposort function, which processes and yields ordered sets; these are flattened into a list by toposort_flatten.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for dependency sorting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a topological sort algorithm with dependency checks and cycle detection. It copies and sanitizes input data, handles empty inputs, and raises an exception for circular dependencies. There are no signs of malicious logic or malicious side effects. The only noteworthy aspect is the custom CircularDependencyError class, which is part of normal error handling. No external network access, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code strictly operates on in-memory data structures for dependency resolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of topological sorting without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs dependency resolution safely within the scope of its functionality.",
