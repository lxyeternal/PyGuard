  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, well-structured implementation of a topological sort algorithm.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are mentioned.\n- The code includes proper error handling for circular dependencies.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is claimed or evident.\n- The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of hidden or malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described purpose, and the logic is consistent with standard topological sort implementations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence or claims of malware, backdoors, or malicious side effects.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of external data handling, network activity, or system modifications, the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clarity of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is purely algorithmic, operating on in-memory data structures.\n- No external dependencies, network calls, or file I/O.\n- Proper error handling for circular dependencies.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n### Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?\n- No, all scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, transparent implementation of a dependency resolution algorithm, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, well-documented, and appropriate for dependency management.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nThe overall assessment aligns with a low malware, obfuscation, and security risk profile. The code is benign and suitable for production use in dependency resolution contexts.",
