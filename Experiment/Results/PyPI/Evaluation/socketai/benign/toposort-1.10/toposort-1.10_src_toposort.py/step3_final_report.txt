  "purpose": "Implement a topological sort algorithm to order items based on dependencies, detecting circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'data' representing items and their dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted external data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Data is copied and processed internally; dependencies are resolved through set operations and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and handles edge cases properly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of topological sort with cycle detection. It copies input data to avoid mutation, identifies items with no dependencies, yields them, and removes dependencies iteratively. It raises an exception if cycles are detected. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear, and the exception handling is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency resolution utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is well-implemented, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified as zero.",
