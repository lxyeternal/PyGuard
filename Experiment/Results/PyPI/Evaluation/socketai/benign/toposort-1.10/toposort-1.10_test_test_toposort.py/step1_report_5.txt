{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'toposort' module, testing topological sorting functions and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest' and 'toposort' module functions, along with 'CircularDependencyError'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present; code only performs tests.",
  "flows": "Input data structures flow into toposort functions, which process and generate sorted output; no data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Test data is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises well-structured unit tests verifying functionality, error handling, and module metadata. No external data input, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The module being tested is assumed safe, and the tests themselves are typical for code validation. No signs of sabotage, data exfiltration, or malware are present. The code adheres to best practices for testing and does not manipulate or leak data. Overall, the code appears to be standard testing routines for a sorting module, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'toposort' module with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It functions solely for testing purposes and does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks.",
