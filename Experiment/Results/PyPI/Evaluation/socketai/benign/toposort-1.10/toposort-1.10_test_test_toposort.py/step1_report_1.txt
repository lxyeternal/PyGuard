  "purpose": "Unit tests for the toposort module, verifying topological sorting functionality and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'toposort' module, including toposort, toposort_flatten, CircularDependencyError; no external or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data leakages or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is test code that calls functions but does not process untrusted input or produce side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is standard test suite for a known library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive unittest suite for the 'toposort' library, including tests for dependency ordering, cycle detection, input immutability, and handling of non-orderable objects. It imports the toposort functions and error classes, and runs assertions to validate expected behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. All functions are standard unit tests. The code structure is clear, and the purpose is explicitly for testing the toposort module functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign unit test suite for a topological sorting library. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified. The code is well-structured and focused solely on testing functionality.",
