{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'toposort' module, verifying correctness and behavior in various scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data, imports from 'toposort', and uses 'unittest' framework functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The tests invoke 'toposort' functions with predefined data; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The test code is standard for a testing suite.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'unittest' and the 'toposort' module, then defines multiple test classes with methods that check various behaviors of 'toposort'. The tests cover normal operation, cycle detection, input immutability, handling of different data types, and module attributes. All data used are hardcoded within the test code, and no external or untrusted data sources are involved. The tests include assertions for expected outputs, exception handling, and module attributes. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident, and the code adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit testing script for the 'toposort' module. It performs no malicious activities, contains no hidden or malicious code, and solely tests the functionality of the 'toposort' implementation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
