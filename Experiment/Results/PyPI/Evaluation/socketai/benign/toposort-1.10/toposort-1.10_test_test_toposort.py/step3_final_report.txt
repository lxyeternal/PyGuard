{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the 'toposort' module, verifying its correctness, cycle detection, input immutability, and API attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal, hardcoded data structures within test functions; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed; no network, file, or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "The tests pass predefined data through 'toposort' functions to verify expected outputs; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite that uses static, hardcoded data to validate the 'toposort' library. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. All operations are contained within the test functions, with no external dependencies or malicious constructs. The tests include cycle detection, input immutability, handling of various data types, and API attribute validation, all of which are typical for such testing purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for 'toposort' with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
