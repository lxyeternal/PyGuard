{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the 'toposort' module, verifying its functionality, cycle detection, input immutability, and public API consistency.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest' and specific functions/classes from 'toposort' module; uses test data within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network communication; no data leakage, credential handling, or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Test functions generate and evaluate data structures for toposort logic; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, misleading variable usage, or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests to validate the functionality of the 'toposort' module, including handling of cycles, data integrity, and API correctness. It imports standard testing libraries and performs assertions on various data types and structures. No malicious patterns, network activities, or security-sensitive operations are found. The code's structure and content align with typical testing practices and do not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for the 'toposort' module, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves purely as validation code and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
