  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'toposort' module, verifying topological sorting functionality, cycle detection, and input immutability.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest' and functions/classes from 'toposort' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Tests invoke 'toposort' functions with various data structures; no external data flow or untrusted sink interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is purely for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unittests designed to verify the correctness and robustness of the 'toposort' module, including cycle detection, input immutability, and handling various data types. No suspicious patterns, code injection points, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly performs assertions and exception handling related to topological sorting, with no external or hidden side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite for a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is standard testing code, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
