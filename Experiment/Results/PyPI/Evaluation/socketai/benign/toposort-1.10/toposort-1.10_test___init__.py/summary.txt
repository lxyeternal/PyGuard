  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code snippets in reports 2 and 4 demonstrate high malicious potential due to unsafe dynamic code execution and data exfiltration capabilities, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The other reports are benign or non-functional, with low scores. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high security threat landscape primarily driven by reports 2 and 4, with scores of approximately 0.8 for malware, 0.2 for obfuscation, and 0.75 for overall security risk."
