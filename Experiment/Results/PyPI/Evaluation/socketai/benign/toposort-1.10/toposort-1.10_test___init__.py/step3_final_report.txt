  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code snippets for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns, focusing on supply chain threats such as code injection, data leakage, and unauthorized code execution.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, or external sources; code execution points such as eval() and exec(); network requests; environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data passed to eval() and exec(), network communication for data exfiltration, environment variables used in code logic, potential file or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into eval()/exec() or network requests, potentially leading to code execution or data leakage, with untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() and exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded URLs, environment variable handling, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution without validation, placeholder or non-functional code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high-risk patterns when eval() and exec() are used on untrusted inputs, especially in reports 2 and 4, indicating potential remote code execution and data exfiltration. Reports 1, 3, and 5 show benign or non-functional code with no malicious indicators. The obfuscation level is minimal, with only report 1 mentioning slight obfuscation. The security risks are elevated in reports with dangerous dynamic code execution, justifying high malware and risk scores. Overall, the analysis aligns with the scores, with reports 2 and 4 representing significant threats, and others being benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets in reports 2 and 4 demonstrate high malicious potential due to unsafe dynamic code execution and data exfiltration capabilities, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The other reports are benign or non-functional, with low scores. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high security threat landscape primarily driven by reports 2 and 4, with scores of approximately 0.8 for malware, 0.2 for obfuscation, and 0.75 for overall security risk.",
