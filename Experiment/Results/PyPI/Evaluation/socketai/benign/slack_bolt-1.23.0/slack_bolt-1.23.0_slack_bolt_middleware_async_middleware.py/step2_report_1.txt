  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring rationale, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an abstract class `AsyncMiddleware` for Slack Bolt applications.\n- Contains an abstract async method `async_process` with parameters `req`, `resp`, and `next`.\n- Provides a `name` property for identification.\n- No actual data processing, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n- The code is purely structural, meant for extension.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a straightforward framework component with no actual data handling, network activity, or external input/output.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The purpose is to serve as a base class for middleware implementations.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is well-documented and follows standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is purely structural and contains no data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- No reason to assign higher scores unless the code was embedded with malicious payloads or vulnerabilities, which is not the case here.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified, as the analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign framework component with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, safe abstract class for middleware.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code does not pose any security risks or contain malicious elements.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
