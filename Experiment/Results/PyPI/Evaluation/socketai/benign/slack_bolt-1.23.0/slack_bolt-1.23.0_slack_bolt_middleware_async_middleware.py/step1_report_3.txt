{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract asynchronous middleware class for Slack Bolt framework, allowing custom request processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, typing) and specific Slack Bolt modules; no external data input sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions or properties process untrusted input data directly; no data leakage or sensitive information handling evident.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow involving untrusted inputs to critical functions or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for middleware interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for middleware with an abstract method 'async_process' intended to be overridden. The method signature suggests it processes request and response objects and invokes the next middleware. The class includes a property 'name' that constructs a string based on module and class name. No data processing, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. Usage is limited to defining middleware, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured middleware interface for the Slack Bolt framework. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard component for building middleware in a Slack bot application, with no security risks identified.",
