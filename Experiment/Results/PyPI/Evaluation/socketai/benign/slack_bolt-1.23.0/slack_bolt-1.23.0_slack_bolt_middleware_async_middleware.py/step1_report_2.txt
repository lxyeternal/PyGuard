{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for asynchronous middleware in a Slack Bolt application, intended to process incoming requests before passing control to subsequent functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, class definitions, method parameters (`req`, `resp`, `next`), and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or external calls. The `async_process` method is intended to be implemented by subclasses and may process request data.",
  "flows": "The source is the invocation of the `async_process` method with `req`, `resp`, and `next`. The `next()` function, when called, continues the middleware chain. No external or untrusted data flows are evident within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is a typical middleware pattern with clear documentation. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an abstract middleware class with clear method signatures and documentation. It does not include any network operations, data leaks, or other suspicious behavior. All imports are from trusted libraries related to Slack Bolt. The purpose is to allow extension via subclasses that implement `async_process`. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and benign abstract middleware class definition for Slack Bolt applications. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and appears safe for use. It is purely structural, intended for extension.",
