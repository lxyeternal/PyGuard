  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class 'AsyncMiddleware' for asynchronous middleware in Slack Bolt applications, serving as a template for extension.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries and Slack Bolt modules; no external or user input sources directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not output data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; the code is purely structural with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, well-documented, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structural abstract class for middleware with an async method 'async_process' and a 'name' property. It contains no data handling, network calls, or external interactions. The code is standard, benign, and intended for extension. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate a safe, framework-level component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured abstract class for middleware in Slack Bolt applications. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The current assessment and scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
