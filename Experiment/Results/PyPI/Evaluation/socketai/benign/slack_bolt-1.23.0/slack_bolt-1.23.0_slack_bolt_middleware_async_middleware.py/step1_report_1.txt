{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for asynchronous middleware in a Slack Bolt application, enabling request processing before reaching listener functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, typing) and specific Slack Bolt modules; no external or user input sources directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle or output untrusted data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code provides a structure for middleware processing but does not implement any data flow or logic that handles untrusted input or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract middleware class with an async processing method, properties, and documentation. No data handling, network operations, or external interactions are present. It serves as a framework component rather than executable logic. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The imports and structure are typical for an async middleware setup in a Python Slack app.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign framework component defining middleware structure without any malicious intent or security issues.",
