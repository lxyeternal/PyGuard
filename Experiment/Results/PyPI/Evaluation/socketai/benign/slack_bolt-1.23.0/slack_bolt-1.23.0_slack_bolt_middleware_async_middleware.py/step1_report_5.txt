{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for asynchronous middleware components in a Slack Bolt application, specifying how request processing should be implemented.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (abc, typing, slack_bolt.request.async_request, slack_bolt.response).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions. No network operations, file operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a class with abstract methods and a property, without any data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The class is a standard abstract base class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class for async middleware with a required method 'async_process' for processing requests. It includes detailed docstrings explaining usage. No input/output handling, network operations, or other risky behaviors are present. The code is purely structural and documentation-focused, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe abstract class definition for middleware in a Slack Bolt application. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks observed. It serves as a template for middleware implementation without any malicious intent.",
