{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for asynchronous middleware processing in a Slack Bolt application.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (abc, typing, slack_bolt), class attributes, and method parameters (req, resp, next).",
  "sinks": "The 'next' callable that proceeds the middleware chain; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (req, resp) passed into 'async_process', and 'next()' function called to continue processing; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation. The code is standard for middleware pattern implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract middleware class with an async process method, used for request processing. It uses standard Python practices and imports, with no suspicious code or behavior. The 'async_process' method is abstract and intended for internal framework use, with no data manipulation or external communication. The class exposes a 'name' property for identification. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of an abstract middleware class for Slack Bolt. No malicious or security-related issues are detected.",
