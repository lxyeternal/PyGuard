  "purpose": "Defines an abstract middleware class for Slack Bolt applications, establishing a contract for request processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from abc, typing, and slack_bolt.request/response modules; no data input sources within the class itself.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the class only defines an interface without executing logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this code; it's purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward abstract class.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-documented abstract base class defining a middleware interface with an abstract 'process' method and a 'name' property. It contains no executable logic, external calls, or data handling that could pose security risks. The class serves as a template for subclasses, which could implement malicious behavior, but the base code itself is benign. The minimal 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in some reports is a conservative estimate, but the code's nature justifies a score of 0. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard abstract class serving as a middleware interface for Slack Bolt applications. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe and suitable for supply chain use without concerns.",
