  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for middleware processing requests in a Slack Bolt application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines class and method structures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only outlines abstract method signatures and property.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class 'Middleware' with an abstract 'process' method designed for internal framework use. It includes clear docstrings, type annotations, and a property method. There are no indications of external data handling, no network activity, and no operations that could be malicious. The structure aligns with standard Python class design for middleware pattern implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation of a middleware base class for a Slack Bolt app. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
