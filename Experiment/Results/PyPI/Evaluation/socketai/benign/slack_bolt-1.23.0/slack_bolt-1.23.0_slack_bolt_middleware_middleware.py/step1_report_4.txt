{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract middleware class for processing Slack Bolt requests and responses within a Python application.",
  "sources": "Imports from abc, typing, and slack_bolt.request/response modules; no direct data input or external data sources are present in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines an abstract class and methods without actual execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is a standard abstract class definition with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract middleware class with a process method intended for internal use within bolt-python. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or other actions that could be malicious. The structure and content are standard for middleware design, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. It imports typical modules and defines an interface for middleware processing, which is common in web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-documented abstract class definition for middleware in a Slack Bolt application. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the application framework.",
