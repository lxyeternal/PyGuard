{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract middleware class for processing Slack Bolt requests and responses in a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules (abc, typing, slack_bolt.request, slack_bolt.response), and within the process method parameters (req, resp, next).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code, as it does not perform data output, external network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code flows from instantiation of middleware subclasses to the invocation of the process method, which should call 'next()' to continue chain processing; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly defines an interface without any implementation, input validation, or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class for middleware with a process method that must be implemented by subclasses. It specifies the structure for handling requests and responses within a Slack bolt framework. There are no hardcoded secrets, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard, well-structured, and adheres to common design patterns for middleware. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign abstract class definition for middleware in a Slack bolt application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It serves as a framework component and does not perform any data handling or network operations itself.",
