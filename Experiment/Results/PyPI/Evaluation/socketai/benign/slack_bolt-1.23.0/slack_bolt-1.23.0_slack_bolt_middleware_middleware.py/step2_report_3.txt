  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude that the code is a straightforward, standard abstract class defining a middleware interface for Slack Bolt applications. They emphasize the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, external data handling, or network activity. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware scores are zero across all reports.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n\n- The code itself is purely structural, defining an abstract class with a method that raises NotImplementedError. It imports standard and third-party modules but does not execute any logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is an interface template, not executable logic, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.1. Given the code's purpose as an abstract interface with no executable logic, this is justified. Any higher score would be unreasonable unless there was evidence of malicious intent or dangerous behavior, which is absent here.\n\n**Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that improper implementation of subclasses could introduce vulnerabilities but cannot assess that from this interface alone.\n\n**Consistency of scores with the report:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 to account for potential misuse in subclasses, but given the reports, 0 is appropriate)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard abstract class serving as a framework component. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- No changes needed; the current evaluation accurately reflects the code's security posture.",
