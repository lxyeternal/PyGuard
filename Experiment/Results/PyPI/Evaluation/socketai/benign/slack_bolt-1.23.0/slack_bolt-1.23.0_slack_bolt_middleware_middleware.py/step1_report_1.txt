  "purpose": "Defines an abstract middleware class for processing Slack Bolt requests and responses in a web application framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, typing), and from slack_bolt.request and slack_bolt.response modules.",
  "sinks": "The abstract method 'process' accepts request, response, and next function, which could potentially handle untrusted data if implemented maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data (req, resp) flows through the 'process' method, which calls the 'next' function to continue processing; however, actual flow depends on implementation of 'process' in subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs. The code is purely structural, defining an abstract class with no executable logic beyond raising NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a template for middleware, including documentation and an abstract 'process' method intended to be implemented elsewhere. It imports standard and third-party modules but does not execute any data processing itself. There are no hardcoded secrets, unsafe evaluations, network operations, or obfuscated code. As it only defines an interface, there is minimal risk. However, improper implementation of 'process' in subclasses could introduce vulnerabilities, but that cannot be assessed from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a structural framework for middleware and contains no malicious behavior or security issues on its own. It provides an abstract base class for future implementations. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
