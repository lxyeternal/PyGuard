  "purpose": "Define and register middleware classes for request processing in a web framework or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.authorization, .custom_middleware, etc.) and the list of middleware classes.",
  "sinks": "Registration of middleware classes via Middleware.register() which could invoke dynamic behaviors, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> register middleware classes -> expose via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward module setup with class registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several middleware classes from local modules and registers them with a Middleware registry. The comments advise against adding async modules, indicating awareness of execution context. The process involves standard import, registration, and export mechanisms. No user input handling, no environment variable usage, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code are present. The purpose appears to be setting up middleware components for request handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a setup module to register middleware classes for request processing. It performs standard imports, registration, and exposes the components. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
