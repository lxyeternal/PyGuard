  "purpose": "Define and register middleware classes for processing requests in a system, enabling modular middleware handling and authorization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.authorization, .custom_middleware, .ignoring_self_events, .middleware, .request_verification, .ssl_check, .url_verification, .attaching_function_token); list of middleware classes.",
  "sinks": "Registering middleware classes with Middleware.register, which is a standard registration process. No direct data sinks, no untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Importing middleware classes → appending classes to a list → registering classes via Middleware.register → exporting class list and names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. No reflective or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be straightforward class registration and export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several middleware classes from local modules, registers a set of predefined middleware classes with a registration system, and exposes these components via __all__ for external use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard for a modular Python middleware setup, with no external data sources or untrusted inputs handled directly. The code structure and comments suggest a clear purpose of request processing and authorization, with no suspicious or harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module for middleware registration and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and intended solely for organizing middleware components.",
