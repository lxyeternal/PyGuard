  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a module aggregating async classes/functions for Slack Bolt framework, importing from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling; primarily import statements.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; straightforward boilerplate code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's an import aggregator with documentation.\n- No data flow or external handling, no anomalies.\n- Also very straightforward and benign.\n- Confidence slightly lower but still high (0.9). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import statements, no data handling, no suspicious code.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Confidence is full (1.0). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments: a module exposing async components, purely import/export.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Very high confidence (1). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard import module, no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Confidence is full (1). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify this as a benign import/export module.\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured module that aggregates async classes/functions for Slack Bolt framework.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard module setup for an async Slack app framework, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reported scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
