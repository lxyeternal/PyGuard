  "purpose": "Module aggregating async classes/functions for Slack Bolt framework, serving as an import/export setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules for async Slack app components.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external data handling, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements without runtime data flow; no external data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports various internal async classes and functions related to Slack Bolt apps and exposes them via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate code with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code content. Confidence in this assessment is high (≥0.9).",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard setup for an async Slack app framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.",
