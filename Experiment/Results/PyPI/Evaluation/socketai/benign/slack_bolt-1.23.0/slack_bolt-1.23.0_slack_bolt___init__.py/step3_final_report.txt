{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) for a Python Slack app framework, importing internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports from the package directory, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Static import statements establishing the module's API surface; no runtime data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports various internal classes and functions, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic behavior, user input handling, network activity, or data processing. All imports are from internal modules, and the structure is typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as an API surface for the package. The static nature and lack of external interactions strongly suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
