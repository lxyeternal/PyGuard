  "purpose": "This code defines the main module for a Python framework to build Slack apps, importing various components and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package, no external or untrusted data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no handling of untrusted data or user inputs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing logic are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. All imports are from internal modules; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ list to define exported symbols. It imports various components and context classes necessary for a Slack app framework, with no logic, data processing, or external inputs involved. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The structure and content are consistent with a standard package __init__.py file intended to organize and expose internal modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization module for a Slack app framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
