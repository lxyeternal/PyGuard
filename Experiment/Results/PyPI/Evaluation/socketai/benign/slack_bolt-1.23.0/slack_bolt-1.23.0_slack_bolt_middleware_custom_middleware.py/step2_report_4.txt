  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a `CustomMiddleware` class for Slack Bolt.\n- Calls a user-supplied function (`func`) with dynamically built kwargs.\n- Uses external utilities for argument introspection and logger setup.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The primary risk depends on whether `func` is malicious or untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and follows typical middleware patterns.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns.\n- **Potential risk:** The main concern is the trustworthiness of `func`. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Dynamic invocation:** Standard for middleware but could be exploited if `func` is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All agree that the code is standard, with no malicious patterns.\n- The main sink (`self.func`) is invoked with dynamically built kwargs, which could be a vector if `func` is malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Scores:**\n- `malware`: 0 in all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- `obfuscated`: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- `securityRisk`: 0.2, reflecting a low risk primarily due to reliance on external `func`.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The code **itself** is benign and typical for middleware design.\n- The **main security concern** is **trusting `func`** supplied by the user or external sources.\n- The reports correctly identify that malicious behavior depends on the external function, not the middleware code itself.\n- The **scores** assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are reasonable and consistent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased if the context involves untrusted code execution, but given the current information, 0.2 is appropriate.\n- The **malware score** should remain 0 unless evidence of malicious code in `func` is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, dependent on trustworthiness of `func`)\n\nThe code is a standard middleware pattern, and the reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2            |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and typical for middleware design. The primary concern is external trust in `func`, which is outside the scope of this code review.**",
