  "flows": "get_arg_names_of_callable -> build_required_kwargs -> self.func",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard middleware pattern",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that executes a user-supplied function with arguments built from request, response, logger, and next callback. It relies on external utilities for argument introspection and logging setup. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The main risk stems from executing an external function which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is inherent to callback patterns. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious features or vulnerabilities within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign middleware pattern that executes a provided function with constructed arguments. No malware, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the external function, which is outside the scope of this code. Scores are consistent and appropriate.",
