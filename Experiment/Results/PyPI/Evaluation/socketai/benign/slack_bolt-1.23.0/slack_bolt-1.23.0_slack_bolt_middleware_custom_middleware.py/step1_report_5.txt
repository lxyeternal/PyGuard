{
  "purpose": "Define a custom middleware class for Slack Bolt framework that processes requests and responses with user-defined functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'req' (BoltRequest) and 'resp' (BoltResponse) parameters, as well as the 'func' callable provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'func' callable is invoked with dynamically built keyword arguments, which may include untrusted data from 'req'.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'req' flows into 'build_required_kwargs', which prepares arguments for 'self.func', then 'self.func' executes potentially with untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'build_required_kwargs' and dynamic argument passing is normal; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for middleware that delegates request processing to a user-supplied function, with careful argument construction. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The code is structured and uses standard library and well-known slack_bolt functions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of custom middleware for the Slack Bolt framework. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this code fragment.",
