  "purpose": "Defines a custom middleware class for Slack Bolt framework that dynamically calls a user-provided function with specific arguments.",
  "sources": "User-provided function `func` passed during instantiation, environment variables via imported libraries, input data from `req` and `resp` objects.",
  "sinks": "Calling the user-provided function `func` with dynamically built arguments, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input data from `req`, `resp`, and internal variables flow into `build_required_kwargs`, which then passes data to `self.func`, executing user code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a middleware class that invokes a user-supplied function with specific parameters, relying on external utility functions to build arguments. The function `self.func` is called directly with dynamically assembled keyword arguments, which could potentially execute malicious code if `func` is malicious. However, this is a common pattern for middleware design and does not inherently imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The imports are from legitimate libraries related to Slack Bolt framework, and there is no evident obfuscation or malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a middleware class for the Slack Bolt framework that dynamically calls a user-defined function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet. The potential risk depends entirely on the nature of the user-supplied `func`, which is outside the scope of this code review.",
