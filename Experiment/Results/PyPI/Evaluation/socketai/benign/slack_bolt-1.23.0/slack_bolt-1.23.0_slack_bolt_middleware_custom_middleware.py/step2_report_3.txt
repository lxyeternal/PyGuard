  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a `CustomMiddleware` class for Slack Bolt.\n- Stores a user-supplied function (`func`) and uses external utilities to determine argument names and setup logging.\n- The `process` method constructs kwargs via `build_required_kwargs` and calls `func` with these.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code acts as a conduit, executing user-supplied functions with specific arguments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity.\n- The dynamic invocation of `func` is standard for middleware but could be risky if `func` is malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious patterns within this code snippet.\n- The external utility functions (`build_required_kwargs`, `get_arg_names_of_callable`) are assumed safe and standard.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The main concern is the execution of an external, potentially untrusted `func`. This is a known pattern in middleware design, but it does not inherently imply malicious intent.\n- No indication that `build_required_kwargs` or other parts inject malicious data or perform unsafe operations.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with the reports; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, as the code itself is safe, but the execution of untrusted `func` could be risky in practice)\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the security risk hinges on the trustworthiness of `func`.\n- The pattern is common and does not suggest malicious intent by itself.\n- The code is well-structured, and no suspicious features are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard middleware pattern, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential risk stems from executing an external function, which is outside the scope of this code snippet and depends on user trust.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and align with my assessment. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is low risk, assuming the `func` provided is trustworthy.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe in isolation, but developers should ensure that any `func` passed to this middleware is validated or trusted to prevent potential security issues in practice.",
