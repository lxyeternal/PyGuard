  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a middleware wrapper that calls a user-provided function (`func`) with dynamically constructed arguments.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The primary concern is the potential execution of malicious code if `func` is malicious, which is a standard risk in callback-based systems.\n- The code relies on external utilities (`build_required_kwargs`, `get_arg_names_of_callable`) to prepare arguments, which are assumed safe.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does not** contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The dynamic invocation of `func` is typical in middleware patterns but inherently risky if `func` is untrusted.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware activity within this code snippet.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The report correctly notes that the main risk hinges on the trustworthiness of `func`. This is a standard consideration and not a flaw in the code itself.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of `build_required_kwargs` and `get_arg_names_of_callable` appears appropriate and safe.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is justified; no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** They are consistently `0.2`, reflecting low risk, mainly due to reliance on external, potentially untrusted functions.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable because the primary risk involves the execution of a user-supplied function (`func`). If `func` is malicious, it could execute harmful actions, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet and depends on external inputs.\n- The code itself is safe and standard for middleware design.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that `func` could be malicious if provided externally. This is valid, but the code does not facilitate malicious activity on its own.\n- No evidence suggests that the code is obfuscated or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to trust assumptions on `func`)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe middleware pattern with minimal inherent risk. The main security concern is external trust in the `func` callback, which is typical for such extensibility points. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign a risk score higher than 0.5, it would require evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities within the code itself, which is not present here.",
