{
  "purpose": "Define a custom middleware class for Slack Bolt framework, wrapping a callable with logging and request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'req' (BoltRequest), 'resp' (BoltResponse), and 'next' (callable).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sink is 'self.func' invoked with dynamically built keyword arguments, which could execute malicious code if 'self.func' is compromised or malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'req', 'resp', and 'next' flows into 'self.func' via 'build_required_kwargs'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic argument passing with 'build_required_kwargs' may obscure actual data flow; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that wraps a provided callable 'func' for Slack Bolt. It uses 'build_required_kwargs' to assemble arguments, including request, response, and logger, before calling 'func'. The class includes logging and a property for name identification. No external data sources, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic invocation of 'self.func' is standard for middleware design but could be a concern if 'func' is malicious. However, the code itself does not include malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a typical middleware wrapper with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard middleware wrapper for Slack Bolt with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It dynamically invokes a provided function with constructed arguments, which is typical in such patterns. No malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
