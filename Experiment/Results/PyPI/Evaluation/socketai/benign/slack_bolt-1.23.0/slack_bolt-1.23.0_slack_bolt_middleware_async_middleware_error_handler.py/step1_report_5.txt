  "purpose": "Define asynchronous middleware error handlers for Slack Bolt framework, including custom and default implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules and functions, class constructors, and method parameters that accept input such as error, request, response, and functions.",
  "sinks": "Usage of logger.exception, invocation of user-provided async function (func), and modification of response attributes.",
  "flows": "Error handling flow where handle method is invoked with error, request, response; then user-defined function (if any) is called with dynamically built kwargs; response attributes are conditionally modified based on returned response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of get_arg_names_of_callable and build_async_required_kwargs could potentially be examined further, but are likely utility functions without malicious intent. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling middleware errors asynchronously within the Slack Bolt framework. It includes a base abstract class and two implementations: one invoking a user-provided async function to handle errors, and a default logger-based handler. The code performs standard operations: building kwargs for the user function, logging exceptions, and modifying response objects if applicable. No suspicious behaviors, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads, are present. Usage of external utility functions appears legitimate. Overall, the code is designed for error handling without any evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard, well-structured error handling classes for an asynchronous Slack middleware environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and intended for error management with no security risks detected.",
