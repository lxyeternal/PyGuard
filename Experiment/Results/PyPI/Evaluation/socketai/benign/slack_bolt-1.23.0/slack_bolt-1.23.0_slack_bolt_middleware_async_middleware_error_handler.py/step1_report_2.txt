{
  "purpose": "Defines asynchronous middleware error handling classes for Slack Bolt framework, allowing custom or default handling of exceptions during middleware execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries, including functions that generate kwargs and get callable argument names.",
  "sinks": "Calls to user-provided middleware functions (self.func), assignment to response attributes (status, headers, body), logging of exceptions.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in middleware handling invoke the handle() method, which then calls user-defined functions with generated kwargs; response attributes may be modified based on returned values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code. Usage of get_arg_names_of_callable and build_async_required_kwargs may introduce dynamic behavior, but are standard for flexible middleware handling. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract error handler class with two concrete implementations: one that invokes a user-defined async function to handle errors and potentially modify the response, and another that logs the exception. The user-provided function is called with dynamically built kwargs, including error, request, response, and logger. The code appears to follow standard middleware patterns without suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Use of helper functions and class methods is typical for extensible middleware error handling. Overall, the code seems legitimate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of asynchronous middleware error handling classes for Slack Bolt. It allows customization of error responses and logs failures, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
