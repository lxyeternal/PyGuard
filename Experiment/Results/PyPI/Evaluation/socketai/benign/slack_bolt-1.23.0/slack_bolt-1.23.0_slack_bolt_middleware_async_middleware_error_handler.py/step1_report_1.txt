{
  "purpose": "This code defines asynchronous middleware error handling classes for a Slack Bolt app, allowing custom or default error handling during middleware execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries, specifically: get_arg_names_of_callable, build_async_required_kwargs, AsyncBoltRequest, BoltResponse, Logger.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes user-provided functions (self.func) in handle method of AsyncCustomMiddlewareErrorHandler, which could execute malicious code if self.func is malicious.",
  "flows": "Error occurs -> handle() is called -> build_async_required_kwargs() generates kwargs -> self.func(**kwargs) executes -> potentially malicious user-defined function runs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_arg_names_of_callable and build_async_required_kwargs could be exploited if these functions are malicious, but they are standard utility functions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up error handler classes for middleware errors. It calls external utility functions and executes a user-supplied async function. There are no signs of embedded malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potentially risky part is executing a callable provided at runtime, which is typical for middleware design but requires trust in the function. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The logging of exceptions is standard practice. Overall, the code appears secure assuming the imported utility functions are safe and the user-supplied function is trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a middleware error handling framework with no evident malicious intent. The execution of user-provided functions could be risky if those functions are malicious, but this is a normal pattern in middleware design. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
