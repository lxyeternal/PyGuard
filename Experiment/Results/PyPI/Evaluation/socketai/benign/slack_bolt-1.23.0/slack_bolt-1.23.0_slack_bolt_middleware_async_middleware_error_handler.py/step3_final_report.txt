  "purpose": "Defines asynchronous middleware error handler classes for Slack Bolt applications, allowing custom or default error processing.",
  "sources": "User-supplied function `self.func`, utility functions `get_arg_names_of_callable` and `build_async_required_kwargs`, data from `error`, `request`, and `response` objects.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of `self.func` with dynamically generated kwargs; modification of `response` based on `returned_response`.",
  "flows": "Error, request, response -> build kwargs -> call `self.func` -> possibly modify response; or log exception.",
  "anomalies": "Standard pattern; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements async error handling classes, executing user-defined functions with dynamically built arguments. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is trusting external functions, which is typical in middleware. Utility functions are assumed safe. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of async middleware error handlers. It relies on trusted utility functions and user handlers. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected. The primary risk is executing untrusted user functions, which is inherent to middleware design but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
