{
  "purpose": "Defines asynchronous middleware error handling classes for Slack Bolt framework, allowing custom and default error handling during middleware execution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the error object, AsyncBoltRequest, and optional BoltResponse passed to handle methods. get_arg_names_of_callable inspects the callable's argument names.",
  "sinks": "The handle methods modify the response object by updating status, headers, and body if a response is returned from the custom handler. Logging occurs via logger.exception.",
  "flows": "Error occurs in middleware, handle method gathers context, builds kwargs, calls user-defined or default handler, then updates response if applicable. Logging occurs on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is standard for middleware error handling. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous error handling classes with methods to invoke user-defined or default error handlers. It uses proper dependency injection, logging, and response updates. No external data leaks, unsafe code, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious network activity, reverse shells, or data theft routines. The code appears legitimate and typical for middleware error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of middleware error handlers for an asynchronous Slack Bolt framework, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
