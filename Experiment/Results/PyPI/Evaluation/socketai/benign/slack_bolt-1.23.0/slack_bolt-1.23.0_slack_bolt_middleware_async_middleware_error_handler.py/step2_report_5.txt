  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core code: asynchronous middleware error handlers for Slack Bolt, with a base abstract class and two implementations (custom handler invoking user function, default handler logging exception).  \n- They consistently identify that the code calls external utility functions (`get_arg_names_of_callable`, `build_async_required_kwargs`) and executes user-provided functions (`self.func`) in the custom handler.  \n- All reports conclude that the code appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), and malware scores are zero in all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no evident bugs or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** No hardcoded credentials, network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.  \n- **Execution of user-provided functions:** This is a common pattern in middleware design; it is not inherently malicious but does require trust in the user functions.  \n- **Utility functions (`get_arg_names_of_callable`, `build_async_required_kwargs`):** These are standard and unlikely malicious unless compromised, which is outside the scope here.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Is the invocation of `self.func` risky?**  \n  Not inherently. It is typical for middleware to execute user-supplied handlers. The security depends on trust in those functions, not the pattern itself.\n\n- **Are there any signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and follows common async middleware error handling patterns.\n\n- **Any assumptions that could be challenged?**  \n  The reports assume that the utility functions are safe and that executing `self.func` is acceptable. While generally true, if `self.func` is malicious, it could execute harmful code. However, this is a design choice, not a vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a low risk (~0.1-0.2). This is reasonable because the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities, but executing arbitrary user functions could be risky if those functions are malicious. Given the context, a low risk score is justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores are consistent and reasonable.**  \n- **No changes needed.**  \n- **The overall security posture is safe assuming the environment and trust boundaries are maintained.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 – 0.2 (as per reports, justified by the pattern of executing user functions)  \n\n**Additional note:**  \nThe code is a standard middleware error handling pattern, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only potential concern is executing external functions, which is typical and acceptable in middleware design, provided trust is established.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
