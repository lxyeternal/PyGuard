{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous middleware error handling system for a Slack Bolt app, allowing custom or default error handling strategies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'error' (exceptions), 'request' (AsyncBoltRequest), and 'response' (BoltResponse).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'response' object where status, headers, and body are modified, and the logger where exceptions are logged.",
  "flows": "Errors caught in middleware invoke 'handle' methods, which may modify the response or log exceptions, depending on the handler used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries and well-defined external packages with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete classes for middleware error handling, utilizing external utilities for argument extraction and async request handling. The custom handler calls a user-defined async function, passing in dynamically built arguments, and may modify the response if a new BoltResponse is returned. The default handler logs exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data flow. All external calls and data manipulations are standard for middleware error handling logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an async middleware error handling system without malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code's security risk is minimal and should be considered safe within its intended context.",
