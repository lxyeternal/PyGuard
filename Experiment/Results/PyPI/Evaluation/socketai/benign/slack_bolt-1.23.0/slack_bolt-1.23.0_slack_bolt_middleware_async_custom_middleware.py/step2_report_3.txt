  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Validation & Issues Present:**\n   - The code defines an `AsyncCustomMiddleware` class that enforces `func` to be an async function, initializes logging, extracts argument names, and invokes `func` with dynamically built kwargs.\n   - There are no apparent issues with the code structure, validation, or logic. It adheres to standard async middleware patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n   - No explicit errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The reliance on external utility functions (`build_async_required_kwargs`, `get_arg_names_of_callable`, etc.) assumes these are secure and correct.\n   - The code passes `next` into `func`, which is standard in middleware but could be misused if `func` is malicious—however, this is expected behavior and not an error.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests unreasonable scoring; scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - None of the reports justify higher scores; all correctly assign low malware and risk scores.\n   - Given the code's straightforward, standard middleware pattern and absence of malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions about the behavior of external utility functions; they treat them as trusted.\n   - They correctly identify that the main risk depends on the trustworthiness of `func` provided by the user.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.\n- The main potential risk is if `func` is malicious, but that is outside the scope of this static review.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal inherent risk, mainly depending on external `func` trustworthiness)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, secure implementation of an async middleware component for Slack Bolt apps. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
