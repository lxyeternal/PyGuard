  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is a standard async middleware class, validating that `func` is an async function, and calling it with constructed kwargs. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code relies on external utility functions for introspection and request handling, which are presumed safe. The low risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code enforces that `func` is an async coroutine, with no suspicious code or malicious intent. The utility functions used are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code structure. The low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report notes that the code invokes `self.func` with dynamically built kwargs, which could be a vector if `self.func` is malicious or handles untrusted data improperly. However, it concludes that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is justified considering the potential for malicious `func`, but since the code enforces `func` to be an async coroutine and uses safe utility functions, the risk remains low.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent, and the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code validates `func` as async, uses utility functions, and calls `func` with constructed kwargs. The main concern is that if `func` is malicious, it could perform harmful actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is appropriate given the potential for malicious `func`, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Reinforces that the code enforces `func` to be async, uses utility functions, and invokes `func` with constructed kwargs. No suspicious operations are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is justified. The code is standard middleware with no evident malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports. Given the reliance on external user-provided functions (`func`), a slightly elevated risk score (0.2) is justified, especially since malicious `func` could be invoked.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0. Since no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the potential risk if `func` is malicious, but the code itself is secure.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code relies heavily on external utility functions (`get_arg_names_of_callable`, `is_callable_coroutine`, etc.). If these are compromised or malicious, they could introduce vulnerabilities, but assuming they are standard, safe utilities, the overall risk remains low.\n- The validation that `func` is an async coroutine is a good safeguard.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**              | **0.2**  |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the security principles involved.",
