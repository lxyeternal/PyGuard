  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous middleware class for Slack Bolt applications that wraps and executes user-provided async functions with proper argument handling and logging.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the `func` parameter passed during initialization, environment variables (indirectly via imported functions), and potentially external data through the request object `req`.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the invocation of the user-defined `func` with dynamically built keyword arguments, which could potentially be exploited if `func` processes untrusted input improperly. No direct network or file system operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data (via `func`, `req`, `resp`) is passed to `build_async_required_kwargs` to produce arguments for `func`, then `func` is awaited and its output returned as a response.",
  "anomalies": "The code enforces that `func` is an async function, which is good practice. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are detected. The `next` callback is passed directly to `func`, which could be a concern if `func` misuses it, but this is standard for middleware. No obfuscation or malicious code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that wraps user-provided asynchronous functions as middleware components. It performs runtime checks to ensure `func` is an async coroutine, uses imported utility functions for argument inspection and logging, and constructs a dictionary of arguments to call `func`. The code operates within expected patterns for middleware design, with no signs of malicious intent. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system interactions are present. The use of `build_async_required_kwargs` and dynamic invocation appears safe and intended for flexible middleware functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard middleware implementation for Slack Bolt with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It securely enforces async functions, handles arguments appropriately, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
