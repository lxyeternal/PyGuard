{
  "purpose": "Defines an asynchronous custom middleware class for Slack Bolt framework, enabling middleware registration with async functions.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries and modules; uses get_arg_names_of_callable and get_bolt_app_logger functions; calls build_async_required_kwargs; accesses self.func, self.arg_names, self.logger",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.func with dynamically built kwargs; potential execution of user-defined async functions; no unsafe data handling observed",
  "flows": "Constructor verifies that func is async; async_process calls self.func with constructed kwargs; logger initialized from external library functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; uses dynamic function inspection and calls without evident malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for async middleware that verifies input functions are coroutine-based, logs information, and invokes user-defined async functions with constructed keyword arguments. All external calls are to well-known utility functions; no suspicious data flows or code patterns are present. No insecure operations or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of async middleware for Slack Bolt, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
