  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous middleware class for Slack Bolt app integration, enabling custom async processing with logging and request/response handling.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, import statements, and attribute initializations.",
  "sinks": "The async_process method calls the user-defined function 'func' with dynamically built keyword arguments, potentially passing untrusted data if 'func' handles untrusted inputs improperly.",
  "flows": "Request data flows from 'req' and 'resp' into the 'func' via 'build_async_required_kwargs'. The 'next' function is passed into 'func' as well. The user-defined 'func' processes data and returns a response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code relies on external utilities for function introspection and logging, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async middleware class that validates whether the provided 'func' is a coroutine. It initializes logging and argument extraction. During processing, it invokes 'func' with contextually built kwargs. No external data exfiltration, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure appears standard for middleware in an async Python web framework, with proper separation of concerns and no suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of an async middleware component for Slack Bolt apps. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident based on this fragment.",
