  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, input handling, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string variable without any logic, data handling, or external calls. It appears to be a straightforward package metadata declaration. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity detected. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security risks present. It does not perform any operations beyond defining a version string.",
