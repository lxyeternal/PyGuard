  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**  \n   All reports consistently identify that the code only contains a static version string assignment and an informational comment pointing to the PyPI page. There are no functions, input/output handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious constructs is detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly noting the simplicity and benign nature of the code. They do not claim any vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior beyond the trivial assignment and comment. No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is purely declarative and contains no malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious elements, there is no justification for higher scores in malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious code, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Analysis:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (benign, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the scores are appropriate. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The comments and code serve only informational purposes, which is standard in package version declarations.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
