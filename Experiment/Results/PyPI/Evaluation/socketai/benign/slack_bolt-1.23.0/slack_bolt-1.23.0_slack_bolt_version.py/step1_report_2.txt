{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package, likely for internal or external reference.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string \"1.23.0\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is a simple version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code logic, input handling, or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a static version string to __version__, which is common practice in Python packages. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The comment points users to check the latest version on PyPI, but this is informational and not code executing any network or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves an informational purpose only.",
