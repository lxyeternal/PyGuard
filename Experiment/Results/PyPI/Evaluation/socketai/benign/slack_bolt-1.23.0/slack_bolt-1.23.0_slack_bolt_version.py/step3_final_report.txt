  "purpose": "Declare the package version for the 'slack-bolt' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, informational comment with URL.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment and an informational comment. No input handling, network activity, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is typical for Python package version declaration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. Scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The comments and structure are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
