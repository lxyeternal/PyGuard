  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing hyperparameter optimization, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly marked as 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report overestimates the actual low risk, which is negligible given the benign nature of the code."
