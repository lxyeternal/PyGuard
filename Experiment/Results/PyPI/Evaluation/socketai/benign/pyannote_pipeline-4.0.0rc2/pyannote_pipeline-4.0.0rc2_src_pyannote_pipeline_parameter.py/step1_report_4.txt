  "purpose": "Define hyper-parameter classes for use in hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, including categorical, discrete, integer, log-uniform, uniform, and fixed parameters, as well as a container class ParamDict.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, __call__ methods, and attribute accesses.",
  "sinks": "Trial suggestion methods (suggest_categorical, suggest_discrete_uniform, suggest_int, suggest_loguniform, suggest_uniform), attribute access via getattr.",
  "flows": "Class constructors and __call__ methods invoke trial suggestion functions, which generate hyperparameter values based on untrusted input (parameter choices).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hidden behaviors; code appears to be straightforward implementation of hyperparameter classes with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions for various hyperparameters used in optimization routines. All methods and attributes are standard and expected for such use cases. The import of a third-party library (optuna) is typical for hyperparameter tuning. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors. The use of __call__ methods for dynamic suggestion from the trial object is standard practice. The ParamDict class wraps parameters and provides attribute access, with no unsafe or malicious behavior. No obfuscated or hidden code is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of hyperparameter classes for use with Optuna, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
