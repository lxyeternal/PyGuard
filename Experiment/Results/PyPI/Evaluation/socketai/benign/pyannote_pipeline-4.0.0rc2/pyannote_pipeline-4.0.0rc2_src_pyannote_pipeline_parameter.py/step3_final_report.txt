{
  "purpose": "Defines hyper-parameter classes for use with the Optuna library, facilitating parameter suggestion during hyper-parameter optimization.",
  "sources": "Uses the 'trial.suggest_*' methods from the Optuna 'Trial' object to generate parameter values.",
  "sinks": "No external data outputs, network activity, or data leaks; primarily calls to Optuna suggest methods.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'Trial' object via suggest_* methods; no external data flows or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for various hyper-parameter types, utilizing standard Optuna suggest methods. It performs no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The structure is clear, with no obfuscation or anomalies. The use of suggest_* functions aligns with typical hyper-parameter tuning practices. No external data sources or sinks indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of hyper-parameter classes for Optuna, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a very low risk due to interaction with external libraries but no actual threat.",
