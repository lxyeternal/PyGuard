{
  "purpose": "Define hyper-parameter classes for use with Optuna optimization framework, allowing users to specify parameter search spaces and fixed parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typing', 'optuna.trial', and local modules; class initializations; methods that call 'trial.suggest_*' functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'trial.suggest_categorical', 'trial.suggest_discrete_uniform', 'trial.suggest_int', 'trial.suggest_loguniform', 'trial.suggest_uniform' within __call__ methods; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from method parameters (e.g., 'name' and 'trial') flows into the 'suggest_*' functions, which generate parameter values; no external data flow or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears to be standard for defining hyper-parameter search spaces. No hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes for hyper-parameter specification, primarily wrapping Optuna's suggestion methods. It imports only necessary modules, with no indication of malicious intent. All method calls to 'trial.suggest_*' are legitimate for hyper-parameter optimization. The code is well-structured, and no suspicious data flows, external network calls, or hidden behaviors are identified. The purpose is to facilitate parameter search in machine learning or optimization workflows. There are no anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for hyper-parameter management in optimization tasks. It contains no malware, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, it is safe and transparent. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
