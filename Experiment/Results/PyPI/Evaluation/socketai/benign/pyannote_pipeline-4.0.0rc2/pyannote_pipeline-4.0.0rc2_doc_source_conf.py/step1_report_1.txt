  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the pyannote.pipeline project.",
  "sources": "Imports os and sys modules; inserts a path to sys.path; imports pyannote.pipeline; accesses pyannote.pipeline.__version__.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leak points detected.",
  "flows": "Imports modules, modifies sys.path, reads version from pyannote.pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code observed. The code is standard configuration for documentation build.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path to include a parent directory, and retrieves version information from the pyannote.pipeline module. The code contains no external input reading beyond standard library imports, no data flows to external systems, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, and no embedded network activity or malicious commands. All modifications are typical for documentation setup, and no security-sensitive operations or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration script for building project documentation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe setup file.",
