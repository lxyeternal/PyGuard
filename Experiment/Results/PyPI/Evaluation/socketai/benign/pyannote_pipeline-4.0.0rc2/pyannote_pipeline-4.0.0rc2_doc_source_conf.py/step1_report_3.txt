  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'pyannote.pipeline' Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'sys', and 'pyannote.pipeline' modules; modifies sys.path; sets various Sphinx configuration options.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to files, executes untrusted input, or makes network connections.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and modifies sys.path, which are safe operations; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is standard Sphinx configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up documentation build parameters, including extensions, paths, project info, output options, and intersphinx mappings. All code operations are static configuration assignments with no dynamic or potentially malicious behavior. No external inputs are processed, and no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
