  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, importing modules, setting paths, and defining project info.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and pyannote.pipeline; reads version info from pyannote.pipeline.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external data sinks, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data; no dynamic data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or embedded secrets. The sys.path modification is typical for local module referencing. Version info is retrieved directly from a trusted module. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious and should be adjusted to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
