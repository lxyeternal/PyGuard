  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for building documentation for the 'pyannote.pipeline' project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from system environment, file paths, and the pyannote.pipeline module for version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets configuration parameters without any data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static configuration setup for documentation generation, importing system and module info to set parameters. It primarily defines static variables and configuration options for Sphinx. No network, file writing, or dynamic code execution occurs within this script. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
