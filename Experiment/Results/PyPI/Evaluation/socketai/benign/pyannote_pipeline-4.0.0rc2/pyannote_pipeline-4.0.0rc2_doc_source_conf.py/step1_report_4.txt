  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation of the pyannote.pipeline project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from pyannote.pipeline.__version__, imports os and sys modules, and modifies sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a module, modifies sys.path to include parent directory.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code primarily consists of standard documentation build configuration settings.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Sphinx documentation configuration, importing standard modules, adjusting sys.path, configuring extensions, and defining output options. It reads the project version from an imported module. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code is typical for documentation build scripts, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
