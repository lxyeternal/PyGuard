{
  "purpose": "Pipeline hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, managing storage, samplers, and pruning strategies.",
  "sources": "Reads input data, configuration, and storage paths; no external network activity.",
  "sinks": "Stores trial results in local storage; no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed through the pipeline; results are stored locally; no external data flows or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Deprecated storage warnings are standard and not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an optimization framework utilizing well-known libraries (Optuna, tqdm, numpy, scipy). It manages storage, sampling, pruning, and trial evaluation in a typical manner. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors. The code is readable, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security-related signals are consistent with a benign hyperparameter tuning utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured hyperparameter optimization class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
