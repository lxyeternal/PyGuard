{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for a configurable, instantiable pipeline with parameter management, serialization, and output functions, primarily handling parameters, file I/O, and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, external YAML configuration files, method calls, and internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations including YAML, RTTM, and TXT files.",
  "flows": "Parameters are loaded from files or set via method calls into internal structures; outputs are written to files; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'yaml.load()' instead of 'yaml.safe_load()', which can be a security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pipeline framework with parameter management, serialization, and output formatting. No malicious behavior, backdoors, code injection, or obfuscation are evident. The only security concern is the use of 'yaml.load()', which could be exploited if loading malicious YAML files. No suspicious code, network activity, or sabotage signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and benign. The only recommended security improvement is to replace 'yaml.load()' with 'yaml.safe_load()' to prevent potential YAML deserialization vulnerabilities. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.",
