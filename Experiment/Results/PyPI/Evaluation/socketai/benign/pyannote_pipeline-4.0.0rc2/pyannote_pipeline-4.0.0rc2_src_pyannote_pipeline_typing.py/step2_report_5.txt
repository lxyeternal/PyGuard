  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup for type annotations, involving imports from 'typing' and 'typing_extensions', with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code is consistent across reports, with similar conclusions about benign intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality:**\n   - The code only defines type variables (`TypeVar`) and a string literal type (`Literal`) with conditional import for compatibility.\n   - No dynamic code, no data processing, no I/O, no network activity.\n   - The code is static and solely for type hinting, which is a common pattern.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or mistakes are evident.\n   - The use of try-except for conditional import is standard and correct.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or code.\n   - **Security risk score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely for type annotations with no runtime or external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score is also 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious assumptions or speculative vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, harmless setup for type annotations, with no malicious or security concerns.",
