{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type variables and a string literal for use in type annotations, likely part of a larger software component related to data processing or optimization.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for type annotations, with a conditional import for compatibility. No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'TypeVar' from 'typing' to define generic types, and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on availability. It defines 'PipelineInput' and 'PipelineOutput' as type variables and 'Direction' as a string literal type restricted to 'minimize' or 'maximize'. There are no runtime data inputs, outputs, or execution logic. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, harmless snippet intended for type safety in larger codebases.",
