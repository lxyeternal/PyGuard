{
  "purpose": "Define type variables and a literal type for pipeline configurations, likely part of a larger data processing or machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'typing' module and 'typing_extensions' for backward compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard type annotations and license notices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type variables and a string literal type for defining pipeline behavior ('minimize' or 'maximize'). It includes a try-except block to import 'Literal' from 'typing' or fallback to 'typing_extensions' for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network activity are present. The license and author comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward, benign setup for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for type annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only involves type imports and variable definitions. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
