  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as setting up type variables and string literal types for type annotations.\n- The code includes standard license comments, conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime logic.\n- No data flows, network activity, or input/output operations are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with their benign assessment.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: purely static type alias declarations with compatibility handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate type hinting, which is common and safe.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports uniformly rate the malware and security risk as 0, which seems reasonable given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The confidence score is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty of benign nature, which appears justified.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious code detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign setup for type annotations.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a common purpose in type hinting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is harmless; the scores are appropriate; no further action required.",
