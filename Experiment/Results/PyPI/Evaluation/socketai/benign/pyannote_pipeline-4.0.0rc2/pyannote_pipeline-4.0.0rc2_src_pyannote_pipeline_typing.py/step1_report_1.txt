  "purpose": "Defines type variables and a string literal type for specifying optimization directions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library ('typing') and conditional import from 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard type alias declarations and conditional import handling for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic code executions, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a straightforward setup for type annotations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type annotation setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
