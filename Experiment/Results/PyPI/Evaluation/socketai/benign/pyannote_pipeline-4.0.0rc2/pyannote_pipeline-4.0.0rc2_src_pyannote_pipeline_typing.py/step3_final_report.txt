  "purpose": "Define type variables and a string literal type for use in type annotations, with compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and 'typing_extensions', type variable definitions, and the Literal type assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type annotations without data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type annotation setup with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign setup for type annotations, defining type variables and a Literal type with a try-except import for compatibility. It contains only license comments and type alias declarations, with no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard and intended for static type hinting, which is common and safe. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard setup for type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
