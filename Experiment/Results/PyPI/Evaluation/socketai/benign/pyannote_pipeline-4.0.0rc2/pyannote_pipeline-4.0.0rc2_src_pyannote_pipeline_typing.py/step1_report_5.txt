{
  "purpose": "Define type variables and a Literal type for use in a Python typing context, likely for a data processing or optimization pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'typing_extensions' modules; no external or user input data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to type annotations; no runtime data processing, input, or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares type aliases and imports with fallback for older Python versions. It includes a standard MIT license and author info. There are no network operations, file I/O, command execution, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure is straightforward and consistent with typical type annotation setup. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for type annotations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a foundation for type hinting in a larger project.",
