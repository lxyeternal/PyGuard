  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are all identical or very similar: they define type variables and a string literal type for use in type annotations.\n- The code includes a try-except import for 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is a common compatibility pattern.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network activity, or any dynamic code execution.\n- The code contains only license comments and type annotations, which are benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Confirming presence of issues**\n\n**Are any issues present?**  \nNo. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard type annotation setup with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Flaws or mistakes in the reports**\n\n**Are there any logical flaws?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly interpret the code as benign. They do not overstate potential risks or assume malicious intent where there is none.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Scoring review**\n\n**Scores given:**\n\n| Report | malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0          | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0          | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0          | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0          | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0          | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Are these reasonable?**  \nYes. Since the code is purely for type annotations with no dynamic or malicious content, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. Obfuscated code is also 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Security risk is correctly scored as 0.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n**Are any scores > 0.5 justified?**  \nNo. The code is harmless, with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. So, a score of 0 for malware and security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n**Is there any malicious activity?**  \nNo. The code is standard type annotation setup, with no dynamic execution, network, or data manipulation. Malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 6: Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n**Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \nNo. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign and do not assume vulnerabilities where none exist.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n**Are the scores consistent?**  \nYes. All reports agree on the benign nature, and scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard setup for type annotations with no runtime or security-sensitive operations. No malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign and standard.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis are correct.",
