  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is straightforward, defining type variables and a string literal type with conditional import handling.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing.\n- The report correctly identifies it as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with standard type alias definitions and compatibility handling.\n- No runtime data handling or suspicious logic.\n- Correctly identified as benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 seem appropriate.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: type variables and literal types, with compatibility handling.\n- No malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are correct.\n- Confidence is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, standard type annotations, license, and author info.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are correct.\n- Confidence score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard type alias definitions with fallback import.\n- No malicious or suspicious elements.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is purely for type annotation purposes, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, serving as a type annotation setup, and does not pose any security threat.",
