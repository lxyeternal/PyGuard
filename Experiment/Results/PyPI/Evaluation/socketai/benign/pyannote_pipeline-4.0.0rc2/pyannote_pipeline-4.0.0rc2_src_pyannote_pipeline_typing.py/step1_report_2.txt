  "purpose": "Define type variables and a string literal type for use in a Python package, with no apparent runtime behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data is processed or output at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; type imports are static and used for type hinting only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code present; only standard type hinting imports and definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type variables and a string literal type for use elsewhere. It includes a try-except block to support older Python versions by importing 'Literal' from 'typing_extensions' if not available in 'typing'. This is a common compatibility pattern. The rest is standard license and copyright comments. No dynamic code, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard setup code for type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks.",
