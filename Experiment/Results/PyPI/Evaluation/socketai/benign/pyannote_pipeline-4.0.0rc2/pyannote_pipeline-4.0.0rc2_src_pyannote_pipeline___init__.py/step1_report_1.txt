{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python package initialization file that sets up module metadata and imports key classes for a larger project.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('pyannote-pipeline')",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected; license and authorship comments are standard",
  "analysis": "The script imports package version info dynamically, then imports specific classes from local modules to define the public API. No code executes external commands, handles input, or interacts with environment variables beyond package version retrieval. The license and author comments are typical. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script for a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
