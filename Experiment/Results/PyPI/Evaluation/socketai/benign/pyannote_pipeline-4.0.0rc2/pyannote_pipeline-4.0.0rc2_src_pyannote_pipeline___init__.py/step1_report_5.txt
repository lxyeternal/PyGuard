{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and expose modules for a Python package, specifically 'pyannote-pipeline', and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata to retrieve package version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from source to sink; just metadata retrieval and module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard package setup with license and copyright comments",
  "analysis": "The script contains licensing comments, imports the package version using importlib.metadata, and exposes two classes, Pipeline and Optimizer, for external use. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is to prepare and expose package modules and metadata. All actions are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply exposes modules and retrieves version info. No suspicious activity detected.",
