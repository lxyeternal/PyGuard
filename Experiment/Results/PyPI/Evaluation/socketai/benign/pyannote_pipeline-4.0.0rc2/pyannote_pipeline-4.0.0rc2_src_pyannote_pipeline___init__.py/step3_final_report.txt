  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by setting version info and exposing core classes.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() for package version; local module imports for Pipeline and Optimizer",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info and importing modules; no external data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package initialization code, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, retrieving version info via importlib.metadata, importing local classes, and defining __all__. It contains no external input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The license comments are standard. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and there is no indication of obfuscation or malware.",
