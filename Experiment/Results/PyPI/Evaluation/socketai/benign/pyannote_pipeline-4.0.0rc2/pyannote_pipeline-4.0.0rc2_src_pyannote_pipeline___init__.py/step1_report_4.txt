{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module metadata and import components for a Python package related to a pipeline framework.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('pyannote-pipeline') retrieves the package version; import statements import local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communications, or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "The version information is fetched and stored in __version__; module imports are static and do not involve external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines package metadata, imports, and exports. It uses importlib.metadata to get package version, which is standard practice. No user input, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or hidden behavior. No security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
