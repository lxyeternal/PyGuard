{
  "purpose": "To define and export core classes (Pipeline and Optimizer) and retrieve the version of the 'pyannote-pipeline' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call to fetch package version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or data leaks; no external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval flows from the package metadata source to the __version__ variable, with no further flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of importlib.metadata.version() is standard; no unusual or obfuscated code detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and exports modules. It uses standard Python import and metadata retrieval mechanisms. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data manipulation that could be malicious is present. The license and copyright comments are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a benign package setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply retrieves package version info and exports classes.",
