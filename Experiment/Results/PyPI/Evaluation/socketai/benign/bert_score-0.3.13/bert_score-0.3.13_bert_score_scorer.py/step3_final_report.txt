  "purpose": "A Python class implementing BERTScore evaluation for sentence similarity, including features like IDF weighting, baseline rescaling, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input sentences, model weights, tokenizer, baseline files, and optional plot files.",
  "sinks": "Loads models, tokenizers, baseline TSV/CSV files, and saves plots; no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input sentences → embeddings → scoring → optional visualization and file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "Standard NLP evaluation code utilizing external models and files, with typical data flow and no suspicious operations. External baseline files are standard configuration data. No network activity or code injection present. The code is well-structured and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a BERTScore evaluator with visualization features. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The external file dependencies are typical for such tools and do not indicate malicious intent.",
