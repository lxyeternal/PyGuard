{
  "purpose": "The code defines a BERTScorer class used for computing semantic similarity scores between text sentences using BERT embeddings, with optional IDF weighting and baseline rescaling, along with visualization capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include sentences provided to the score() and plot_example() methods; environment variables are not explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file system writes for loading baselines and saving plots, but no untrusted data is written to network or system in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Input sentences flow through embedding functions and scoring functions; no data flows into external systems or network connections; score calculations are internal, with results used for visualization or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Warning about overwriting IDF weights and fallback baseline path construction are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads models, tokenizers, and baseline data from the filesystem, performs text embedding and similarity scoring, and visualizes similarity matrices. No network communications, code injections, or suspicious data leaks are detected. The use of warnings and file path constructions are standard. No malicious intent or backdoors are present. The structure appears consistent with a typical NLP scoring utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a BERT-based similarity scorer with visualization capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard NLP tasks securely, with no evidence of backdoors or malicious data exfiltration.",
