  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe very minimal code: setting a version string and importing modules.\n- The code snippets are straightforward and typical for package initialization (`__init__.py` files).\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The only potential concern is the use of wildcard imports (`from .score import *`), which can lead to namespace pollution or obscure dependencies, but this is a common practice in some package structures and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard package code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Benign, simple module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The confidence is high.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Typical package initializer; notes potential risk from wildcard import but considers it not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The use of `import *` is flagged as a potential anomaly but not malicious. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting a minor maintainability concern rather than a security threat.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.** No evidence of malware; the score aligns with the concern about wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; minimal code, wildcard import flagged as a concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; the reasoning is sound. The minor security risk score is justified.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Standard package code; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** The minor concerns about wildcard imports are reflected with a 0.2 score, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the minimal code and the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (minor maintainability concern due to wildcard imports, but no security threat)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity. The scores are appropriate, and no further escalation is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their benign assessment.\n- The minor security risk scores are justified given the use of wildcard imports.\n- No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain current scoring; no changes necessary.",
