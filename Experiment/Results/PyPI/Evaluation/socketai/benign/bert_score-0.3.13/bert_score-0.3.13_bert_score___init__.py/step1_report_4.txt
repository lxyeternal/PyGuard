{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and import all contents from local modules 'score' and 'scorer', likely for use in a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the hardcoded __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only initializes a version string and performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered a potential anomaly as it can lead to namespace pollution or obscure dependencies, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a version identifier and importing all components from two modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The wildcard import is a potential concern for code clarity but not for security. No data input/output or network operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with versioning and imports. It shows no signs of malware or malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution for code maintainability but does not indicate security risks.",
