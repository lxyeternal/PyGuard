  "sources": "Reading the version string; importing all symbols from .score and .scorer modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Version string assignment; wildcard imports from local modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can cause namespace pollution but is common in package init files; no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version string and importing all symbols from two local modules. No external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. Wildcard imports are flagged as a maintainability concern but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The scores from reports consistently reflect the benign nature, with minor concern about import style. The overall assessment indicates no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk primarily due to coding style.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The minor concern about wildcard imports does not elevate the security risk significantly. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 to 0.2, reflecting a cautious but safe assessment.",
