  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet provided:\n\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.3.12\"\nfrom .score import *\nfrom .scorer import *\n```\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is minimal, setting a version string and importing all contents from two local modules.\n- There are no signs of external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is common in package `__init__.py` files.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of wildcard imports (`from .score import *`)**: While not inherently malicious, they can obscure dependencies and make security analysis harder if the imported modules are compromised. However, in this context, they are standard practice in package initialization files.\n\n- **No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior**: The code is benign and typical for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is straightforward.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score**: Mostly low (0 or 0.2). The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but it does not constitute a security risk here.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n\n- The risk scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- The slight increase to 0.2 in some reports due to wildcard imports is acceptable but should be flagged for maintainability.\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Potential concern about wildcard imports**: While not malicious, they could be exploited if the imported modules are compromised. However, in a controlled environment with local modules, this is unlikely.\n- **No evidence of malicious code or behavior** in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with minor maintainability concerns but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The minor concern about wildcard imports does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n- The provided scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) due to wildcard imports, but recognize that this is a common pattern in package `__init__.py` files and not inherently risky.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments that this code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
