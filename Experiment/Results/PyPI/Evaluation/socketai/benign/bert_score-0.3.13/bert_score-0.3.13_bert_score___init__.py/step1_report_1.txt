{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and import all contents from two local modules: score and scorer.",
  "sources": "The only data sources are the version string and local module imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and internal.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs. The wildcard imports could be a concern but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version identifier and imports all contents from two local modules. The imports are standard practice in Python packages and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The minimal structure offers no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple version declaration and module import statements. No malicious behavior or security threats are evident.",
