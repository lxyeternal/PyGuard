  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.3.12\"\nfrom .score import *\nfrom .scorer import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard module setup; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is minimal, with no signs of malicious intent. The slightly non-zero securityRisk reflects cautious acknowledgment of wildcard imports, which could be problematic if modules are compromised, but in isolation, it’s benign.\n- **Verdict:** **Consistent and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Also benign, standard practice, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity. The confidence is high, and the scores align well.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the minimal nature, points out potential risks of wildcard import but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The use of wildcard import is noted as a risk for namespace pollution but not malicious. The reasoning is balanced.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; minimal, with cautious note on wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the minimal code and the minor concern about wildcard import but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Straightforward, no malicious activity, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** **Consistent and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied between 0 and 0.2, primarily due to the wildcard import concern. This is reasonable; wildcard imports can cause namespace pollution but are not inherently malicious.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — the use of wildcard imports is a minor concern but not a security risk per se.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify the benign nature of the snippet and appropriately weigh the minor concern about wildcard imports. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The code is a standard module initializer, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 to reflect the minor concern about import style.\n\n**This comprehensive review confirms the code is safe and the reports are accurate.**",
