{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module version and imports all functions or classes from submodules 'score' and 'scorer'.",
  "sources": "The source of data is not explicitly visible in this snippet; no input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports everything from two local modules. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple module setup with versioning and imports. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
