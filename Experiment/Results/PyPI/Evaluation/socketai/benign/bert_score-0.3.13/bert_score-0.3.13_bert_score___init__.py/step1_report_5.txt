{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the version of a package and import all contents from two local modules, 'score' and 'scorer'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from a hardcoded variable and imports modules 'score' and 'scorer'.",
  "sinks": "Potential import statements could introduce malicious modules if they are compromised, but here they are local modules. No external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is observable; the code only assigns a string to a variable and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behavior. The use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered a minor concern for namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports everything from two local modules. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged but not malicious. Overall, the code is simple and standard for package versioning and module imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a straightforward purpose of defining package version and importing modules. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
