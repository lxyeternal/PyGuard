  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, dependency declarations, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used for package metadata.",
  "flows": "Static flow from source (file read) to package configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code. The open() call is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It reads a local README.md file, declares dependencies with version constraints, and defines CLI entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of open() is standard practice, and dependencies are typical for such a package. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe package configuration.",
