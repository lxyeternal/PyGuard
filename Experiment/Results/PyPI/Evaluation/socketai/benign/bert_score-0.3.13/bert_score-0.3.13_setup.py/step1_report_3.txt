  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bert_score' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading long_description content from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' to long_description; package metadata flows are static, no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard setup and package configuration functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The 'long_description' reads a local file ('README.md') with specified encoding. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The dependencies and entry points are typical for a Python package distribution. There are no external network connections or code injection points present in this script. It appears to be a typical, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It reads a local README file and sets up package information, dependencies, and CLI commands safely.",
