  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the bert_score Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing setuptools modules, and specifying package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file into long_description; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() function to read README.md without validation; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure packaging. It reads a local README.md file to set the long description, which is typical for Python packages. No user input, network data, or environment variables are used in a way that could lead to security issues. All dependencies are listed with version constraints, and entry points for CLI are straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a normal setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
