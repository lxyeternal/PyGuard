{
  "purpose": "The script calculates BERTScore for given candidate and reference texts, facilitating evaluation of text similarity using BERT embeddings.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from specified candidate and reference files or strings via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses bert_score.score() function, which internally loads models and processes text data; no direct data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files or command-line strings into variables, then into bert_score.score(), and results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward file operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up command-line argument parsing, reads input files if specified, validates their existence, and then calls bert_score.score() with provided parameters. It outputs the computed BERTScore metrics. No network communication, system modification, or hidden behavior observed. The script leverages the bert_score library in a typical manner, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for calculating BERTScore, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It securely handles input data and outputs results without performing any suspicious actions.",
