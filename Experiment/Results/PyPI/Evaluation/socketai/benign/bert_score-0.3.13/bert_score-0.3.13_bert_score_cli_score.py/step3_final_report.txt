  "purpose": "A command-line utility to compute BERTScore between candidate and reference texts, reading data from files or strings, validating inputs, and outputting similarity scores.",
  "sources": "User-supplied input files and strings for candidate and reference texts.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into external systems; no network or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Reads input files/strings, validates data, passes to bert_score.score(), outputs scores.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; the argument '--use_fast_tokenizer' uses 'action=\"store_false\"', which is a valid argparse pattern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file reading, input validation, and calls a well-known NLP library for scoring. It contains no network activity, code injection, or secret handling. The only minor point is the argparse boolean inversion, which is common and benign. All evidence indicates a benign, straightforward utility for NLP evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for BERTScore calculation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk stems from handling user-supplied files, which is inherent to its purpose but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk.",
