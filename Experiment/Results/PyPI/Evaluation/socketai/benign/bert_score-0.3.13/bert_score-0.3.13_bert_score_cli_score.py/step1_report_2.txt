  "purpose": "Calculate BERTScore for given candidate and reference texts, supporting various configurations and models.",
  "sources": "Input data: command-line arguments, file contents for candidate and reference texts; data read via open() functions.",
  "sinks": "Data reading from files; no other untrusted data handling or external connections observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters parsed from command line → file reading for candidate and reference texts → bert_score.score function call processing data → printing of scores.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with standard library usage. Use of os.path and file reading is typical. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes argument parsing for scoring parameters, reads candidate and reference texts from files or strings, and calls bert_score.score() with the parameters. It then computes average scores and outputs them, optionally at the segment level. No code performs network connections, executes system commands, or handles sensitive data maliciously. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and dependencies suggest a benign utility for evaluating text similarity with BERT models.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for BERTScore computation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads input files, processes data, and outputs scores. There are no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
