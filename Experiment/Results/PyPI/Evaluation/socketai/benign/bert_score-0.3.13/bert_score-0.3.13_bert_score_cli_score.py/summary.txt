  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for BERTScore calculation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk stems from handling user-supplied files, which is inherent to its purpose but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk."
