{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for computing and visualizing BERTScore metrics, primarily used for evaluating NLP models by comparing candidate and reference sentences using BERT embeddings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input sentences (`cands`, `refs`, `candidate`, `reference`) passed as function arguments; reads model, tokenizer, and baseline files from disk; reads CSV baseline files; and loads external libraries and modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to disk or network. It outputs plots and logs to the console. No data is transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Input sentences are processed through embedding functions, with embeddings normalized and similarity matrices computed, then optionally rescaled with baseline data from disk. Results are visualized or returned as scores.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. Baseline files are loaded from specific paths; however, this is standard behavior for baseline rescaling. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No code appears to perform malicious activities such as system compromise or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs NLP evaluation tasks with standard libraries and functions. It loads models, tokenizers, and baseline data from the filesystem; computes similarity matrices; optionally rescales scores; and visualizes results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The baseline files are accessed via predictable paths, which is common for evaluation scripts. All external interactions are limited to reading model files, baseline TSVs, and CSVs, and plotting outputs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of BERTScore evaluation and visualization functions with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses standard libraries and follows typical data processing and visualization patterns without any malicious side effects.",
