{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute and visualize BERTScore metrics for sentence similarity evaluation, primarily for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arguments (candidate and reference sentences), external baseline files (TSV files), and dependencies such as tokenizers, models, and CSV files. It also accesses the filesystem to load baseline data and save plots.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading baseline files from the filesystem, printing warnings or information, and saving figures to disk. There are no network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input sentences are tokenized and embedded via models; these embeddings are then used to compute similarity scores, which can be rescaled using baseline data from files. Results are visualized as plots or returned as numerical scores.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward processing steps. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard natural language processing computations for sentence similarity metrics. It loads models and tokenizers based on input parameters, reads baseline data from files for score rescaling, and saves plots. The functions utilize well-known libraries such as torch, pandas, matplotlib, and transformers. No network calls, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The only file access is for reading baseline TSV files and saving plots, which are legitimate for the described functionality. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data leakage, or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for computing and visualizing BERTScore metrics with optional score rescaling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It operates using standard libraries and file I/O for baseline data and plot storage. Overall, it is a benign component intended for NLP evaluation purposes.",
