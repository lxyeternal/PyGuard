{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compute BERTScore and visualize token similarity matrices for candidate and reference sentences, primarily for evaluating NLP model outputs.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include candidate and reference sentences provided as function arguments; also, the code reads baseline data from TSV files if specified.",
  "sinks": "The code loads models and tokenizers, reads baseline files, and optionally saves figures; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input sentences are tokenized and embedded via model; embeddings are normalized and compared; optionally, baseline data modifies similarity scores; visualizations are generated and optionally saved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code loads models and files in a standard manner. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or secret exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs NLP evaluation tasks, including loading models and tokenizers, computing similarity matrices, optionally applying baseline rescaling, and visualizing results. No suspicious data flow or malicious behavior is present. All file operations are standard; model and tokenizer retrieval functions are assumed to be safe. No data exfiltration or malicious network activity is observed. The code does not manipulate system files or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for evaluating and visualizing BERTScore. It uses standard libraries, follows expected data flows, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malware or supply chain sabotage are present.",
