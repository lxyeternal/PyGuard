  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for general functionality, possibly involving data processing or system interaction. No specific purpose is explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data sources such as files or network connections (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, file writes, or environment variable usage that could leak data or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks like network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious variable naming detected. No indications of data exfiltration or reverse shell activity.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed thoroughly, including initial, middle, and final sections. It does not contain suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No unusual control flow, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. Without context, the code appears to perform standard operations typical for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code does not exhibit malware behavior or security vulnerabilities that warrant concern. It appears safe and typical for general Python scripting tasks.",
