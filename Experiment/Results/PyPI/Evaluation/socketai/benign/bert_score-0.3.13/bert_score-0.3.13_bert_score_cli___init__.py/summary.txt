  "conclusion": "The code reviews are cautious and consistent, indicating no malicious activity or obfuscation. Given the lack of concrete code, the low security risk and malware scores are justified. Minor adjustments could include setting the security risk to 0 for reports with no code, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are appropriate and reliable."
