  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication based on the structure and imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, files, or network sockets (if present). Specific source points are not clearly identifiable without the actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writing, or system commands. No explicit sinks are identifiable without seeing specific function calls or operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs such as network or file systems. Exact flow paths cannot be confirmed without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are visible from the description. However, the absence of code details limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The review lacks specific code content, making detailed source, sink, and flow analysis impossible. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident from the available information. The code appears standard, with no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. Without concrete code snippets, this assessment remains tentative.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the code. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without suspicious elements. However, due to the lack of detailed code, this assessment cannot be fully conclusive.",
