  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, network operations, file I/O, user input, and subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess executions, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network or file operations, but no suspicious flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code, relying on descriptions. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern but conservative default. Confidence levels vary based on detail, with higher confidence in detailed reviews. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation are identified. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews are cautious and consistent, indicating no malicious activity or obfuscation. Given the lack of concrete code, the low security risk and malware scores are justified. Minor adjustments could include setting the security risk to 0 for reports with no code, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are appropriate and reliable.",
