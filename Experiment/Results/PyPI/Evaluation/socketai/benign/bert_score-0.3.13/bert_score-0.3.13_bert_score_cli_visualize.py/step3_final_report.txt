{
  "purpose": "A command-line utility that visualizes BERTScore between reference and candidate sentences, generating an output image file.",
  "sources": "User inputs for reference and candidate sentences, optional model parameters, baseline data, and output filename.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only processes inputs and generates a visualization image without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed from the command line and passed directly to bert_score.plot_example(), which performs the visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard argument parsing, sets multiprocessing strategy, and delegates core functionality to bert_score, a reputable NLP library. No malicious or insecure operations are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It does not handle untrusted data insecurely, nor does it perform network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
