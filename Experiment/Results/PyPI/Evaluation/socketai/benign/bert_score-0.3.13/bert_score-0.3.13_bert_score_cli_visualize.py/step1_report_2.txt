{
  "purpose": "The script visualizes BERTScore for given reference and candidate sentences, generating a visual output.",
  "sources": "Input sources are command-line arguments: reference sentence, candidate sentence, and optional baseline CSV file.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write untrusted data to external systems or perform network communication; mainly generates and saves a visualization file.",
  "flows": "User provides sentences via command-line; these are passed to bert_score.plot_example for processing and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or indirect data handling is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries, sets multiprocessing strategy, and defines argument parsing for visualization parameters. It relies on bert_score's plot_example function to generate a visualization. No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are detected. The code solely handles visualization based on user input, with no malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign script for visualizing BERTScore between sentences. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
