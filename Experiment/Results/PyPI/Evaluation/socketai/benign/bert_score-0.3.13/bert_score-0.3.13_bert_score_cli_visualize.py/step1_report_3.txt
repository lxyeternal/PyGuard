{
  "purpose": "The script visualizes BERTScore by generating a similarity matrix between a reference and candidate sentence and saving the output as an image file.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters via argparse from command line; loads user-specified reference and candidate sentences; optional baseline CSV file path.",
  "sinks": "Calls bert_score.plot_example, which likely processes the input data and generates a visualization; writes output image file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> bert_score.plot_example processes data and generates visualization -> saves image file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of standard libraries and legitimate functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes argument parsing, collects user input, and passes parameters to bert_score.plot_example for visualization. There is no code execution of untrusted data beyond passing arguments; no dynamic code evaluation or network communication. The script solely facilitates visualization based on provided sentences and parameters, with optional baseline data. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for visualizing BERTScore, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It safely processes input parameters and delegates the core work to the bert_score library.",
