{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes BERTScore by processing input sentences or files and plotting similarity matrices.",
  "sources": "Input arguments (reference sentence, candidate sentence, file paths), environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Calling bert_score.plot_example with user-provided arguments, writing output image file.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → main() → bert_score.plot_example → output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Use of standard libraries and a known package (bert_score).",
  "analysis": "The code sets multiprocessing strategy, parses command-line arguments for input parameters, and calls bert_score's plot_example function with these parameters. No data is transmitted externally, no system data accessed, and no suspicious code constructs observed. The imported modules are legitimate for this functionality, and there are no embedded or obfuscated malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard visualization tool for BERTScore with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external packages in a typical manner and does not contain any hidden or malicious code.",
