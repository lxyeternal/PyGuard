  "conclusion": "The code is a standard NLP utility module with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the external system call in cache_scibert, which could be exploited if parameters are manipulated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, indicating minimal malware risk but acknowledging supply chain vulnerabilities. To enhance security, replacing os.system() with safer subprocess calls and validating URLs is recommended."
