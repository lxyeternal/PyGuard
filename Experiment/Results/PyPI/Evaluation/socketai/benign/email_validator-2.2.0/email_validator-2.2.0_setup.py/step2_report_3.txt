  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a minimal, standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign and typical.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Recognizes that setup() is called without arguments, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. Calling setup() without parameters is not inherently risky; it may be incomplete but not malicious. I suggest lowering this to 0, as there's no evidence of a security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, notes the minimal, benign nature.\n- Scores: all zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Notes the unusual but benign calling of setup() without arguments.\n- Scores: all zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard, benign setup script.\n- Scores: all zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk score in Report 2, which is set at 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as there's no security risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a minimal, standard setup script with no security concerns.",
