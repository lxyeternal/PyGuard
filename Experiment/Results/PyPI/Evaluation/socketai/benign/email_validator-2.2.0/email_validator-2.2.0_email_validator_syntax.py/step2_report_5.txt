  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive email parsing and validation module, adhering to RFC standards. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Uses standard libraries (re, unicodedata, idna). The confidence level is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code performs detailed validation, normalization, and syntax checks without any suspicious activity. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the report. Security risk is low (0.1), reflecting the inherent complexity but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing meticulous validation, normalization, and proper use of external libraries. No suspicious code or external interactions. High confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, highlighting the absence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is legitimate.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is low (0.1). The reasoning aligns well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on validation of local parts, domain names, handling internationalized addresses, and address literals. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed validation steps, use of Unicode normalization, IDNA, and strict syntax checks suggest a well-implemented, secure module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is minimal (0). The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the comprehensive validation, normalization, and parsing, with no external network or data exfiltration. Focused on correctness and RFC compliance. High confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms that the code is purely validation-focused, with no malicious intent. Use of standard libraries and exception handling is appropriate.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is low (0.2). The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the thorough RFC-compliant validation, normalization, and safe use of external libraries. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed explanation supports that the code is a standard, secure email validation module. No backdoors, malware, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is minimal (0.2).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code strictly performs validation, normalization, and syntax checks.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are consistently low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the inherent complexity but no malicious intent. The code is standard, well-structured, and employs best practices.\n\n- **Potential Discrepancies:** No significant inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily due to complexity and normalization steps, but no threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a robust, standards-compliant email validation module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
