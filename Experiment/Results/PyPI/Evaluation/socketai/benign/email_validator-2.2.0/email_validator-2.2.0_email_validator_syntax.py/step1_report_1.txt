{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for parsing, validating, and normalizing email addresses and their components, including local parts, domain parts, and domain literals.",
  "sources": "Input email string in split_email, local and domain parts in validate_email_local_part and validate_email_domain_name, domain_literal in validate_email_domain_literal.",
  "sinks": "Regular expressions for pattern matching, Unicode normalization functions, idna encoding/decoding, and raising EmailSyntaxError exceptions on validation failures.",
  "flows": "Input email string -> split_email parses and extracts components -> validate_email_local_part and validate_email_domain_name perform syntax and length checks -> validate_email_domain_literal parses domain literals -> exceptions raised if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive Unicode and IDNA normalization and validation logic, which appears standard for email validation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity is present. No dynamic code execution, external data exfiltration, or system modification is observed. The use of idna library for normalization is standard. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive email parsing and validation module. It employs regular expressions, Unicode normalization, and IDNA processing to ensure address syntax and safety. The functions validate length, character sets, and syntax according to RFC standards. No code indicates malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. No network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code structure is logical and adheres to best practices for security-sensitive email validation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, secure email validation implementation without malicious intent. It focuses on syntax validation, normalization, and compliance with RFC standards, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
