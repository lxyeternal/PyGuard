{
  "purpose": "The code provides comprehensive validation and parsing of email addresses, including syntax checks, normalization, and domain validation according to RFC standards.",
  "sources": "Input email string, regex patterns, Unicode normalization, IDNA processing, length checks, and domain/IP literal parsing.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> syntax parsing -> Unicode normalization and IDNA encoding -> syntax validation -> length and domain checks -> output validation results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is structured and uses standard libraries for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs RFC-compliant email parsing, including handling display names, quoted local parts, internationalized addresses, and IP literals. It employs regex, Unicode normalization, and IDNA libraries to ensure correct syntax and domain validity. Exception handling is used to catch invalid inputs. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is clear, and validation steps are thorough, aligning with RFC standards. The use of external libraries like idna and regex patterns for validation is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, RFC-compliant email validation module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1-0.2) are justified. It is safe for use in production environments.",
