  "purpose": "Define regex patterns and constants for validating email addresses according to various RFC standards, including internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for local parts, domain parts, and length constants; no external data sources or input reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines constants and compiled regex patterns; there are no data flows or processing logic involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code solely consists of pattern definitions and constants for email validation.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various regex patterns to validate email addresses per RFC standards, including support for international characters. It includes length constraints and predefined common mailbox names for validation purposes. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present, reducing the risk profile. All patterns appear to be standard and explicitly intended for email validation; no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are found.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of constants and regex patterns used for email validation, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be used for malicious purposes. No security issues are evident.",
