  "purpose": "Define regular expressions and constants for email address validation based on RFC standards, including support for internationalized email addresses.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for local part, domain part, domain literals, quoted strings, and length constants.",
  "sinks": "Regex patterns that validate or match email address components; no external data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flow; patterns are static and used for validation purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Patterns are standard for email validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns according to RFC standards for email validation, including support for international characters. It includes constants for maximum length constraints and common mailbox names. There are no indications of code injection, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All patterns are static, well-documented, and intended for validation purposes. No external data sources or sinks are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for email validation with international support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of email validation constants and regex patterns based on RFC standards. It contains no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to ensuring proper validation rather than security flaws.",
