  "purpose": "Define constants, regular expressions, and length limits for validating email addresses according to various RFC standards, including internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Import of re module; definition of regex patterns for email local parts, domain parts, and special characters.",
  "sinks": "None; no processing or handling of untrusted data is present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "None; this code only defines constants and regex patterns without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and solely defines validation patterns and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes regex patterns for local parts, domain parts, and internationalized email addresses based on RFC standards. It also defines maximum length constants and a list of common mailbox names. There is no dynamic execution, input handling, or data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior is present. The patterns appear correctly constructed for validation purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely provides constants and regex patterns for email validation based on RFC specifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for standard validation use.",
