  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only defines regex patterns and constants for email validation.\n- No dynamic data processing, external input handling, or code execution is present.\n- Patterns are standard, RFC-compliant, and include internationalization support.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is solely pattern definitions, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score: 0** is appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** is justified.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** is correct.\n- **Score justification:** The code is purely declarative, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on RFC compliance.\n- **Malware score: 0** is appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** is justified.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** is correct.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious intent, standard patterns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on regex definitions for email validation.\n- **Malware score: 0** remains appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** justified.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** correct.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly mentions a minimal security risk of 0.1, but this likely reflects the inherent risk in email validation (e.g., pattern bypass, false positives) rather than malicious intent.\n- **Malware score: 0** is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk: 0.1** seems acceptable given the context, as validation patterns can sometimes be bypassed, but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** is correct.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, just standard validation patterns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score: 0** is appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** justified.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; patterns are straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the purpose is validation pattern definitions, the risk is minimal. The one report assigns 0.1, which is acceptable, but perhaps slightly high given the lack of any active processing or external data handling.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (patterns are clear and standard)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no active processing, no external data, no vulnerabilities evident)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, RFC-compliant set of regex patterns and constants for email validation, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, with the minor security risk of 0.1 in one report being acceptable but perhaps slightly overstated given the context.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, standard, and well-understood for email validation purposes.",
