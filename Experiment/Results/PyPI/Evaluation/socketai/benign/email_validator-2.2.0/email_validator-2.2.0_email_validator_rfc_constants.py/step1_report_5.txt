  "purpose": "Define constants, regex patterns, and length limits for email address validation based on various RFC standards, including support for international characters.",
  "sources": "Importing re module; defining regex patterns and constants for email validation.",
  "sinks": "None, as this code only defines constants and regex patterns; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "None, since this code is solely declaration of patterns and constants without data processing or flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly defines regex patterns and constants for email validation, aligned with RFC specifications. No suspicious or malicious code segments or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the re module for regex operations, then defines multiple regex patterns for local and domain parts of email addresses, including support for international characters per RFC 5321/6531. It also sets maximum length constants based on RFC standards. The patterns are well-commented, explaining their purposes. No input handling, external data access, or execution of dynamic code is present. The code appears to be a straightforward, standards-compliant implementation for email address validation without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines constants and regex patterns for email validation in compliance with RFC standards. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured utility code snippet for email validation.",
