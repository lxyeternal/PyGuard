  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code only defines constants and regex patterns for email validation per RFC standards, with no data flows, external data handling, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is purely declarative, with no evident security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code defines validation constants and regex patterns, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, regex patterns and constants for email validation, including internationalization support, with no data flows or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with detailed regex patterns and constants, no data processing or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk score might be considering the complexity of regex patterns, but since no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected, this is acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** The minimal risk score is reasonable given the context; the code is purely for validation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; no data flows, external handling, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code only defines regex patterns and constants for email validation per RFC standards, including internationalization support.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the code's nature as a static validation utility, the security risk is minimal and correctly scored as zero or near-zero.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the slightly elevated securityRisk score in Report 4, but since no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-documented set of regex patterns and constants for email validation, with no security or malicious concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
