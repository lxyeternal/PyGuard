  "purpose": "Define RFC-compliant regex patterns and constants for email validation, including internationalization support and length constraints.",
  "sources": "Constants and regex patterns for email address components, hostname validation, length limits, and common mailbox names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external data handling; static pattern definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely declarative with well-documented regex patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constants and regex patterns for email validation, aligned with RFC standards. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. Patterns are standard, well-commented, and include internationalization support. No suspicious or malicious code is detected. The regex patterns are correctly constructed based on RFC specifications. The security implications are minimal, as the code is static and intended for validation purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC-compliant set of validation patterns with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security and malware scores are appropriate. The code poses no security risk and is safe for use.",
