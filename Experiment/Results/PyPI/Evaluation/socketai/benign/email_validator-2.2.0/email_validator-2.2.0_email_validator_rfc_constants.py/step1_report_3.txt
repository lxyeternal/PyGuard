{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and regex patterns for validating email address components according to various RFC standards, including support for internationalized addresses.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions for ATEXT, DOT_ATOM_TEXT, ATEXT_INTL, DOT_ATOM_TEXT_INTL, ATEXT_HOSTNAME_INTL, HOSTNAME_LABEL, DOMAIN_NAME_REGEX, DOMAIN_LITERAL_CHARS, QTEXT_INTL, and length constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code is focused on defining validation patterns without data handling or processing functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly implemented; patterns are prepared for validation use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. Patterns are standard for email validation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely comprises regular expression definitions for email and hostname validation aligned with RFC standards, including support for international characters. Length constants enforce maximum sizes per RFC specifications. No data processing, external input handling, or malicious logic is present. The code is purely declarative, intended for validation purposes, and adheres to established standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of email validation constants and regex patterns with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It serves as a utility module for email address validation, with no security risks identified.",
