  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as '2.2.0'.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simply assigning a string value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version assignment without additional logic or data handling. No suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
