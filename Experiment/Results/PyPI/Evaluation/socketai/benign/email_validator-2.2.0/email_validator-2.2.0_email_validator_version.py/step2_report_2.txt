  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   The code is: `__version__ = \"2.2.0\"`.  \n   All reports correctly identify that this is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no additional code elements, no functions, no data processing, no external inputs or outputs.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues are present in the code. All reports agree on its benign nature.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They all correctly describe the code as a benign version assignment.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a static assignment with no dynamic or external elements, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n   - The `malware` score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The `securityRisk` is 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on direct observation of the code.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behaviors are necessary, given the simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They reflect the benign nature of the code accurately.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations**:\n- The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
