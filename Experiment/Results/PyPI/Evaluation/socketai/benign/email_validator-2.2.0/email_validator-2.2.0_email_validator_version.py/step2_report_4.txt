  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"2.2.0\"`).\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, external communications, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is static and minimal, serving solely as package metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - All reports agree that there's no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n   - The code does not contain any hidden behaviors, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n   - The scores assigned for malware are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is benign code.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about benignity.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with best practices.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall**, the reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes**:\n- Given the simplicity and clarity, I agree with all the current scores.\n- No further action or scrutiny is required for this code snippet.",
