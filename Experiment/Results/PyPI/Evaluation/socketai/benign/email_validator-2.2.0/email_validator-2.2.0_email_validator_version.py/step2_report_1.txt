  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, dynamic code, or complex logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the certainty of their benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no suspicious elements, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - The assessments are reasonable and cautious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that this code fragment poses no security threat.",
