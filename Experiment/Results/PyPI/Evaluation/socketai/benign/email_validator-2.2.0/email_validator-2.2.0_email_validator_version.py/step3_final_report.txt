  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities. Confidence is high (1), as the code's benign nature is clear and unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
