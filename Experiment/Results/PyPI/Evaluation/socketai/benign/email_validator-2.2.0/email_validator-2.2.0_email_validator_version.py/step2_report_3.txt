  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata. Therefore, **no issues or malicious behaviors are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: all recognize the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- They uniformly state that the code is a simple, static assignment with no data flow or external interactions.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward assignment.  \n- The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, indicating certainty about the benign nature, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks, **any risk scores above 0.5 are unwarranted**.  \n- The reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and this should be maintained.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the actual code content, not assumptions.  \n- They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, static assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of this code fragment.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is completely benign.** No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
