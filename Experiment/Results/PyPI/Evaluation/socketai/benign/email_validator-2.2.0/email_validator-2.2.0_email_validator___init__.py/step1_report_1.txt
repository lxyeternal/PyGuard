{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the initial configuration and imports for an email validation library, including versioning, exception definitions, and domain name restrictions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, global variable definitions, and a lazy-loading function for the 'caching_resolver'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data are present. The lazy loader may indirectly load potentially untrusted modules, but this is a standard pattern for performance.",
  "flows": "The module imports dependencies and defines global configuration constants. The lazy loader defers import of a slow module until needed.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a lazy import pattern to defer loading a potentially slow module. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, configuration constants, and a domain name list for filtering special-use domains. The lazy import pattern for 'caching_resolver' is standard for performance optimization. The domain list is static and well-documented. No evidence of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic was found. The structure and content appear to be legitimate setup code for an email validation library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate setup code for an email validation package. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical configuration and import module with no suspicious elements.",
