{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a Python email validation library, providing exports, configuration options, and special domain handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exceptions_types, .validate_email, .version, .deliverability), global variable definitions, and a list of special-use domain names.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the lazy loading of the 'caching_resolver' function, which dynamically imports from '.deliverability'.",
  "flows": "Code initializes configuration variables, conditionally defines 'caching_resolver' to delay import, and sets up a list of special-use domain names to be rejected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for a validation library. Lazy import is used for performance, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports, configuration defaults, and a list of special domain names. The lazy import pattern in 'caching_resolver' is a common performance optimization, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, and no network activity or external calls are present. The domain list is for validation purposes and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of an email validation library, focusing on configuration and special domain handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is present. It functions as expected within its scope.",
