{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, imports, and conditional function loading for an email validation library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type checking conditional, and global variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Lazy loading pattern for 'caching_resolver' is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines exportable objects, and sets global constants related to email validation. The conditional import of 'caching_resolver' using a lazy loading pattern is a common design choice to improve performance. The global constants define validation options and a list of special-use domain names, which are static and sourced from authoritative standards. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data processing occurs here. The structure and content are typical for a configuration/setup module in a validation library, with no signs of malicious code or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration and setup module for an email validation library. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The lazy import pattern is safe and standard, and no anomalous or suspicious code segments are present.",
