{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an email validation library, providing functions, exceptions, and configuration settings for email syntax and deliverability checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules (.exceptions_types, .validate_email, .version, .deliverability), global attribute definitions, and the SPECIAL_USE_DOMAIN_NAMES list.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data processing, network activity, or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines functions and constants; it does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual logic are present. Lazy loading pattern for caching_resolver is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up exports, configurations, and domain lists for email validation purposes. It employs a lazy import pattern for potentially slow module (deliverability). The global variables configure validation behavior but do not involve any malicious logic. The list of special use domain names is sourced from IANA and used to reject invalid email addresses on specific domains. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical practices for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup module for an email validation library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It only defines configuration, constants, and imports relevant functions and types.",
