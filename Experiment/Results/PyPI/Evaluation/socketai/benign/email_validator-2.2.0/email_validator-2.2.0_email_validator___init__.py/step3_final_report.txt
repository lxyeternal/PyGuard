{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup module for an email validation library, defining imports, constants, and configuration parameters, including a lazy loader for a resolver and a list of special-use domain names.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, static domain list, environment variables (if any), and configuration constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data and configuration constants are used without external input processing.",
  "flows": "Initialization of constants and lazy import pattern for the resolver, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the lazy import pattern is standard for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, primarily configuration and setup with static data. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The lazy import pattern is a common practice and does not introduce security risks. The static domain list is sourced from IANA and used for validation purposes. No external data processing or network activity occurs within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for an email validation library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
