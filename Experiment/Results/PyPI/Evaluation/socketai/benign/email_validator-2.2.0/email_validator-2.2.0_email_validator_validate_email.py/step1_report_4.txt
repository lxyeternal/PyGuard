{
  "purpose": "The code validates and normalizes email addresses, including syntax checks, normalization, and optional deliverability verification.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'email' parameter; configuration flags and DNS resolver objects are also sourced from arguments and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information could be exposed if 'ValidatedEmail' or DNS results are mishandled; DNS resolver interactions can also be a vector if misused.",
  "flows": "Input email is decoded, split, validated, normalized, and optionally checked for DNS MX records; the flow from input to DNS querying constitutes source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive normalization and validation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard email validation processes, including syntax validation, Unicode normalization, case normalization for certain local parts, and optional DNS MX record validation. All operations are consistent with normal email processing logic. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or network misuse are evident. The DNS resolution relies on external libraries, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are visible. The code strictly adheres to email validation standards and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard email validation routine with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs comprehensive syntax checks, normalization, and optional DNS validation securely. No malicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are detected.",
