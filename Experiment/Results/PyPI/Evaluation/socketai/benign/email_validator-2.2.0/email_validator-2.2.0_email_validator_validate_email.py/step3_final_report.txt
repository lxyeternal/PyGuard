{
  "purpose": "This code validates email addresses by decoding, syntax checking, normalization, and optionally verifying deliverability via DNS. It ensures compliance with RFC standards and normalizes input for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input email string or bytes, external constants/configurations, optional dns_resolver parameter",
  "sinks": "DNS resolver queries (if enabled), normalization outputs, exception raising on invalid syntax",
  "flows": "Input email -> split_email -> validate_email_local_part -> normalize local -> validate domain -> assemble normalized email -> optional DNS deliverability check",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for deliverability validation, optional DNS resolver injection, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email validation steps: decoding bytes, splitting into display name, local, and domain parts, syntax validation, Unicode normalization, case normalization for specific mailbox names, domain validation including literals, and optional DNS MX record checks. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The dynamic import is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not suspicious. The DNS resolver parameter is controlled and optional, reducing risk. No signs of sabotage or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured email validation module with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are justified given the optional DNS resolver and dynamic import, which are standard practices. No modifications are necessary.",
