{
  "purpose": "The code validates email addresses by checking syntax, normalization, and optionally deliverability via DNS.",
  "sources": "User-provided email input, passed as function argument 'email'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data output or external system calls that could leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Email input -> Decoding (if bytes) -> Split into display name, local, domain parts -> Validation of local and domain parts -> Normalization -> Optional DNS deliverability check.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for DNS resolver; no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, no malicious system commands, and no external network communications are directly embedded in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email validation procedures: input decoding, syntax validation, normalization, and optional DNS-based deliverability checks. It carefully handles quoted local parts, domain literals, and normalization steps. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is present. The dynamic import for 'validate_email_deliverability' may be to optimize import time, not inherently malicious. All operations are typical for a validation library, and there are no indications of malware or supply chain sabotage within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate email validation module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard checks and normalization without suspicious side effects. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
