{
  "purpose": "The code validates email addresses by parsing, normalizing, and optionally checking deliverability, ensuring compliance with email syntax standards.",
  "sources": "Input email argument; environment variables (via imported constants); optional dns_resolver parameter.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but potential data leaks could occur if data is exposed in logs or error messages; DNS resolver calls are external dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input email -> decode if bytes -> split_email -> validate local part -> normalize local part -> validate domain -> normalize domain -> assemble email -> optional deliverability check.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import within function for deliverability validation, which could be for obfuscation or lazy loading but is not suspicious per se. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures. No suspicious external domain connections are directly embedded in code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email validation: decoding bytes, splitting email components, validating syntax, normalization, and optional DNS checks. It relies on imported modules and constants for validation rules and constants. No obfuscated code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. DNS resolver is optionally injected for testing, indicating flexible design. The code's only external communication is via DNS lookup during deliverability checks, which is expected for email validation. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email validation implementation with no signs of malicious intent. Its design appears conventional, focusing on correctness and configurability. The use of dynamic import for deliverability checking is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the script does not exhibit malware or harmful behavior.",
