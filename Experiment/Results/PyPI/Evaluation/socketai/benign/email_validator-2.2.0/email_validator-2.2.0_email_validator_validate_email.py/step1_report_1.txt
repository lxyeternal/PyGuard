{
  "purpose": "This code validates email addresses for correctness, syntax, and deliverability, returning a detailed object with validation info.",
  "sources": "Input email parameter; configuration constants; optional dns_resolver parameter",
  "sinks": "None directly perform data leaks or system actions; DNS resolver (potential indirect sink if used maliciously)",
  "flows": "Input email -> decoding and splitting -> local part validation -> domain validation -> length check -> optional DNS deliverability check",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns or obfuscated code; dynamic import of deliverability module is normal; no malicious backdoors or data exfiltration detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured validation steps for email syntax, normalization, and optional DNS-based deliverability checks. It uses safe methods like Unicode normalization, RFC-compliant syntax validation, and optional parameters. No malicious logic, data leaks, or system disruptions are present. External DNS resolver usage is controlled via optional parameters. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured email validation module without malicious intent or harmful behavior. It contains no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks beyond normal operation. Its behavior aligns with legitimate email validation functionality.",
