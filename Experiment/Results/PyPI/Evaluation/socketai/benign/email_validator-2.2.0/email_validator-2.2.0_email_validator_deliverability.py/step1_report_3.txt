{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify the deliverability of email domains by resolving DNS records such as MX, A, AAAA, and TXT to determine if an email can be delivered to the specified domain.",
  "sources": "DNS resolver resolve method calls for 'MX', 'A', 'AAAA', and 'TXT' records; input parameters 'domain', 'domain_i18n', 'timeout', and 'dns_resolver'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through DNS responses, which are used solely for internal logic; no external data sinks such as network transmissions or storage are present.",
  "flows": "Input domain data flows into DNS resolve calls; DNS responses are processed to determine deliverability status; exceptions are raised based on DNS responses and internal logic; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present; code uses standard DNS resolution and exception handling. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS lookups for email deliverability verification via MX, A, AAAA, and TXT records. It handles various DNS exceptions gracefully, returning deliverability info or errors. It does not include code injection, data exfiltration, or network activities beyond DNS queries. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present. The code's operations align with standard DNS validation processes and do not show unusual or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DNS-based email deliverability checker without malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It handles DNS records responsibly, with proper exception management. No malware or malicious signals are detected, and the security risk is low.",
