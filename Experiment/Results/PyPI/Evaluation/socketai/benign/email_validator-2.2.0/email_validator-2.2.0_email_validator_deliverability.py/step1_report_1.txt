{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate email deliverability by resolving DNS records (MX, A, AAAA, TXT) for a given domain, and to provide information about whether the domain can accept emails.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters: 'domain', 'domain_i18n', 'timeout', and optionally a 'dns_resolver'. It reads DNS records via the 'dns.resolver' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that process untrusted data to cause data leaks or execution effects. The code raises exceptions but does not execute untrusted code or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (domain names, optional resolver) lead to DNS queries; DNS responses determine the output or raised exceptions. DNS responses influence the structure of 'deliverability_info' or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses the 'dns.resolver' library for DNS lookups, which is standard. It has some fallback logic for DNS resolution. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are observed. The only notable detail is the use of 'dns_resolver' which can be externally injected, but this is standard for dependency injection. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS resolution to verify email domain deliverability, handling various DNS record types and exceptions. It uses standard libraries and follows RFC guidelines. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. It properly manages exceptions, and the logic is consistent with common email validation procedures. The only potential concern is the external injection of 'dns_resolver', but this is a typical dependency injection for testability and configuration, not malicious intent. No obfuscated or malware-like patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DNS-based email deliverability checker. It follows standard procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected.",
