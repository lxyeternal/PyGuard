{
  "purpose": "Command-line tool for validating email addresses and checking their deliverability status.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., ALLOW_SMTPUTF8, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT), command-line arguments, standard input, and imported functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "Printing validation errors and results to standard output, possibly printing JSON data or error messages.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line input serve as sources. Validation functions process email addresses, and output is printed based on validation results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of environment variables for options is standard, no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a typical email validation CLI tool. It loads configuration from environment variables, reads email addresses from command-line arguments or stdin, and outputs validation results. No embedded network calls, data leaks, or suspicious activity are evident. The code relies on imported modules for core validation logic, which are not shown here but assumed standard. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malware indicators are present. The handling of environment variables and input/output appears normal and intended for legitimate email validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign email validation tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data theft. It is safe to use in its current form.",
