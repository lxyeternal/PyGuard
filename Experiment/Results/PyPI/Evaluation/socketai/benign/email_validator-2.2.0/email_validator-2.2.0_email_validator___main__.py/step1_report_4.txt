  "purpose": "A command-line tool for validating email addresses using the validate_email module and related functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), sys.argv, sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Validation function validate_email, print statements, json.dumps for output",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdin or command-line argument flows into validate_email, output flows into print or json.dumps",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used for options but are standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious string manipulations; no dynamic code execution or suspicious external calls observed",
  "analysis": "The script reads configuration options from environment variables and command-line input. It processes email addresses either via stdin or command-line argument, validating them with validate_email, which is imported from a local module. The code outputs validation results as JSON or error messages. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication beyond DNS resolver use within validate_email, or backdoors. Use of environment variables is standard for configuration. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an email validation CLI tool with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on imported modules for core validation, and no dangerous operations are visible in this snippet.",
