  "purpose": "Command-line tool for validating email addresses, either from command-line argument or STDIN, with configurable options via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads email addresses from command-line argument (sys.argv[1]) and from stdin (sys.stdin). Reads environment variables for configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs validation results to stdout, either as JSON or plain text. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and input data; Sink: stdout output of validation results or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code; the use of internal modules (validate_email, caching_resolver) appears legitimate for email validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes configuration options from environment variables, then processes email addresses either from command-line argument or stdin, validating each with validate_email(). Results are printed to stdout. No data leakage, no network communication beyond DNS resolution (which is standard and expected for email validation). No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code relies on external modules for validation, which appears legitimate and standard. There are no signs of malware or sabotage; the code performs its described function securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email validation CLI tool with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles input and output securely and appropriately. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
