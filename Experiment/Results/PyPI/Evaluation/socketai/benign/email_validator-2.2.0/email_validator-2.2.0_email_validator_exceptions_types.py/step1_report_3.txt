{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and data structures for email validation, normalization, and handling, including exception classes for invalid emails and a data class for validated email details.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, exception handling, and attribute accessors; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls are present. The code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it perform any I/O or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks. The only data flow is internal attribute management within class instances.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated attribute and method warnings, but no suspicious or malicious code segments. It uses warnings for deprecation but does not execute unsafe or dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for email validation results and custom exception classes. It manages email data through attributes and provides various accessor methods, including deprecated and backward-compatible ones. There is no evidence of external data input, network activity, or malicious code patterns. The code avoids unsafe operations, and no obfuscated or malicious logic is apparent. The use of warnings is for deprecation notices, not malicious purposes. Overall, this is standard, well-structured application code for email validation data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward data model and exception handling module related to email validation. It does not include any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
