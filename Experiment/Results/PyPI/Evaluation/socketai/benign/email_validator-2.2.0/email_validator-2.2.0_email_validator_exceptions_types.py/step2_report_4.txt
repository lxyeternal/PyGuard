  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as defining exception classes and a data class `ValidatedEmail` for email validation results.\n- No external data input, network activity, or I/O operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution.\n- Warnings are used for deprecation, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign component of an email validation library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** perform any validation, network calls, or data processing; it only defines data structures and exceptions.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The deprecation warnings are benign and for backward compatibility.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- The only minor concern is the use of warnings for deprecated attributes, but this is standard and not problematic.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low values (~0.1), which seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- Since no malicious or obfuscated code is present, both scores should remain at 0.\n- The minimal risk score (~0.1) reflects that this code is a harmless component of a larger system, with no active vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and logical assessment.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code provided:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, standard data structure code)\n\n**Overall, this code is benign, with no signs of security issues or malicious intent.**",
