{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for email validation errors and a class to represent validated email addresses with various attributes and utility methods.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class attributes are set through validation processes (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "No active data flow from source to sink; the class only stores and provides access to email-related data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and exception classes for email validation but does not include actual validation logic, network access, or data processing functions. It is purely structural, with no suspicious behavior, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All methods and attributes serve to store, represent, or access email data. There are warnings for deprecated attributes but nothing malicious. No external inputs or outputs are handled within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of an email validation library, providing data structures and exception handling without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. Overall, the code is safe and aligned with standard practices.",
