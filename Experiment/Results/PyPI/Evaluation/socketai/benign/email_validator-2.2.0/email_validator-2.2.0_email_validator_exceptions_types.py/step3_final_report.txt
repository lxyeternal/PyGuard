{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and a data class for email validation results, serving as data structures within an email validation library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class attributes are set internally or via object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no network, file I/O, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; code only defines data structures and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard use of warnings for deprecation, no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions, exception subclasses, and property methods for managing email validation data. It does not perform any validation, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The presence of deprecation warnings is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured, clear, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data classes and exception handling for email validation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate, and a conservative assessment would set malware and obfuscated scores to 0, with a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
