  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data classes and exception handling for email validation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate, and a conservative assessment would set malware and obfuscated scores to 0, with a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
