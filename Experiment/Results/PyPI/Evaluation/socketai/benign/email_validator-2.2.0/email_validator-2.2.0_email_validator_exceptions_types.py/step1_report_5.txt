{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and structures for validating and representing email addresses, including error handling, normalization, and DNS MX record retrieval.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network transmission, file writes, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly defines data structures and error classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. It performs standard email validation-related tasks. There is a warning regarding deprecation, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for error handling and the ValidatedEmail data structure, with properties and methods for managing email address data. It appears to be part of a larger email validation library. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. There are no dynamic code executions or obfuscation techniques. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings for deprecated attributes, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of an email validation library, focused on data modeling and error handling. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and does not present any security risks based on this fragment.",
