  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exceptions and a data class for email validation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data sources or sinks.\n- Anomalies: None, no suspicious behaviors.\n- Analysis: Straightforward data structures with no network or dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: Benign, very low security risk.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The risk score is very low, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, exception classes and a data class.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or I/O.\n- Anomalies: None, standard code.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard data structure.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, email validation data class.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external input/output.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Clear, standard implementation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) for deprecation warnings, but overall very safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Defines data structures for email validation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Purely structural, no network or dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar class definitions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, primarily due to deprecation warnings and standard code structure. No security vulnerabilities or malicious intents are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' cautious but justified scores)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
