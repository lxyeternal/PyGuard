{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exceptions and a class for representing and handling validated email addresses, including normalization, DNS MX record retrieval, and attribute access.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings and typing modules, but no input sources such as user input, network data, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow paths from external sources to sinks; primarily defines data structures and exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is structured as a data class with standard validation and representation logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes related to email validation. The main class, ValidatedEmail, encapsulates email validation results and provides attribute access, equality checks, and string representations. It includes deprecated methods and warnings, but these are standard for maintaining backward compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious logic, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward, primarily defining data structures and methods for handling email validation results.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of email validation result encapsulation, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform network activity, data leaks, or malicious modifications. The overall security risk is very low.",
