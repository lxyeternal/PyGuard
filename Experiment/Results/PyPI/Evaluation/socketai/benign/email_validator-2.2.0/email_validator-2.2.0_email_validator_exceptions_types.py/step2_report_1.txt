  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is purely class and data structure definitions related to email validation.\n- No input/output, network, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution.\n- The code includes deprecation warnings, which are standard maintenance practices.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature and lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exceptions and a data class, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, just standard data class.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, no malware, very low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (acceptable, minimal)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, standard class definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard code, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same observations: class definitions, no external input, no malicious activity.\n- Uses warnings for deprecation, which is normal.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (small, due to deprecation warnings, but not security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Similar, no external data, no network activity.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same conclusions: purely structural code, no external I/O, no malicious logic.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; 0 is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low, mostly due to deprecation warnings, which are benign.\n\n**However,** considering the entire code snippet and its context, I would assign **my own estimates** as follows:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low; mainly due to deprecation warnings, which are standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured data class and exception definitions for email validation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
