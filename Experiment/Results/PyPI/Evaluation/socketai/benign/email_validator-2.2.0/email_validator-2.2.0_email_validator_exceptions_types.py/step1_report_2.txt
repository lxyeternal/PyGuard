{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and a data structure class for handling and representing validated email addresses, including normalization and DNS record information.",
  "sources": "The code does not contain data input sources like user input, network calls, or environment variables. It is primarily a data class with attribute definitions and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this code only defines data structures and exception classes without any data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or signs of obfuscation. The code follows standard Python class and method definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code primarily consists of class definitions: exception subclasses for email validation errors and a data class 'ValidatedEmail' for holding email validation results. The class contains attributes for email components, normalization, DNS MX record info, and deprecated/legacy attribute accessors. It also includes warnings for deprecated attributes but does not perform any network, file, or system operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward part of a larger email validation library, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data structure and exception class definition for email validation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and non-malicious, serving only as a component for email validation workflows.",
