  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or potential security issues.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static string literal definitions for AWS service constants, resource types, regions, etc.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n- The code uses standard practices for conditional imports based on Python version.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity/documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward static type alias declarations; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the nature of the code as static, safe, and purely for type annotations.\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**\n   - Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Risk scores are zero, consistent with the static, safe nature.\n   - Confidence is high (1) in all reports, which is appropriate given the static analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is static and contains no dynamic or sensitive data, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - No justification exists for any risk scores above 0.5.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard static type annotation module defining string literals for AWS constants.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, serving as a static reference for type checking, with no security concerns.",
