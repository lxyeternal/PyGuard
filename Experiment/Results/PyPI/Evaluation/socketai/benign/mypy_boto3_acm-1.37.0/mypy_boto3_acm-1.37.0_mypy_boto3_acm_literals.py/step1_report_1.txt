  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS ACM and other service-related constants to enable type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions for AWS service and resource names, and type annotations for literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data sources present; the code is purely defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external data; code consists of type alias declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard type annotations and static string literals with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, regions, and other enumerations, all as static, hard-coded string values. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code, user input processing, or external dependencies beyond standard library imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is intended solely for type safety and documentation purposes in Python projects using these AWS-related constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type annotations and string literal definitions for AWS service constants. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. It serves as a static reference for type checking and code clarity.",
