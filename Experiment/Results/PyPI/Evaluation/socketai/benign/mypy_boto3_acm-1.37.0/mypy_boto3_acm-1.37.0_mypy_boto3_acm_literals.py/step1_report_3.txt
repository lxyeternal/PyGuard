  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS ACM service and related types to facilitate type checking and code correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, type alias definitions for literals",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A - static definitions only, no data flow or processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded string literals are standard for enum-like definitions; no secrets, no backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining string literal types using Python's Literal for various AWS ACM and AWS service-related constants. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no inputs, outputs, network interactions, or execution logic. The purpose is to facilitate type checking, with no code that could be exploited or used maliciously. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static definition module for AWS ACM related string literals. It contains no malicious code or security risks. It serves as type annotations for better developer tooling and static analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or security threats.",
