  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static, defining string literal types for AWS service constants.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n- The code uses conditional imports for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- The purpose across reports is to facilitate type checking, static analysis, and documentation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears to be straightforward static type alias definitions.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected; no runtime code, no data flows, no external dependencies beyond standard library imports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and explicit.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n**Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n**Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**However,** I will re-evaluate the scores for consistency and justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 is correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 is correct; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n- **Report 1:** Correctly states that the code is safe, static, and purely for type annotations.\n- **Report 2:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Report 3:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n- **Report 4:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Report 5:** Also correct.\n\n**All reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\nGiven the nature of the code—static type definitions for AWS constants—the scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely for static type annotations, with no runtime or external dependencies, and no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Issues in code:** None.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in safety).\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; all reports correctly assess the code as benign.",
