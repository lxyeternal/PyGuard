  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS ACM and related service constants using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, especially version-dependent import of Literal, and the assignment of various Literal types.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code is only defining type aliases without runtime data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly defines type literals for documentation and type-checking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import to handle version compatibility for 'Literal' from typing or typing_extensions. It then defines multiple string literal type aliases for AWS ACM and other service-related constants. There is no dynamic code, data processing, or external input/output. The license and copyright notice are standard, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be purely for static type hinting, with no side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines type annotations for AWS-related constants, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe, static documentation aid for type checkers.",
