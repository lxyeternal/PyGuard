  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service literal definitions to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for AWS services, regions, resource types, and enumerations.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without data flow or external data sources.",
  "flows": "None; purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS constants, with conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version. No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or external dependencies are involved. The purpose is to provide static type safety and documentation. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The code is clear, straightforward, and serves solely for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type annotation module defining string literals for AWS constants. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.",
