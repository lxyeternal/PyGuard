{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS ACM service and related enumerations using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used or manipulated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version and defines multiple string literal types for AWS ACM and related services. All declarations are static and serve as type annotations for better code clarity and type checking. No data input, output, or processing occurs. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. The content appears to be purely for type hinting purposes without any runtime impact or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of type annotations for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
