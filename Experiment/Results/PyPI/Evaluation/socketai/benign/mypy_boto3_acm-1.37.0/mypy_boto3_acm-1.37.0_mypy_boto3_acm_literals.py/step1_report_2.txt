  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS ACM service and related enumerations to be used for type annotations and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions; no input reading, environment variables, or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code only declares literals.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement and a link to documentation, but these are informational. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines numerous Literal types representing AWS ACM-related string constants, regions, service names, etc. All are static string literals with no dynamic execution or user input. The structure is standard for type annotation definitions, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely provides type definitions for AWS service literals, with no malicious or security concern evident. It appears to be a straightforward static data declaration intended for type safety and documentation.",
