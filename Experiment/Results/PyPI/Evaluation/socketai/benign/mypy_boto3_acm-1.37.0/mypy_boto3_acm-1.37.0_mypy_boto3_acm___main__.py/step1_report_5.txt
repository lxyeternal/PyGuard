  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes to standard output (sys.stdout).",
  "sinks": "Writes package info and version to stdout; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers version info output; otherwise, package info is displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script simply provides CLI output for package info and versioning. It reads user input via command-line arguments and outputs static text to stdout. There are no external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is well-structured, with clear functions for each purpose, and no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version details. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
