  "flows": "Command-line argument (source) -> conditional check -> print_version or print_info (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code solely outputs static package info.",
  "analysis": "The script processes command-line arguments and outputs package info or version. It uses standard library functions without any network, file, or environment variable manipulation. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for CLI tools. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign utility script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that prints package info and version. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code review finds no security risks or malware indicators.",
