  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to check for `--version` and prints predefined strings to `stdout`.\n   - No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n   - The strings printed are hardcoded, with no secrets or sensitive data.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Indicators:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - No input sanitization issues because the input is only checked for a specific static argument.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n   - The \"malware\" scores are all 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0.0, correctly indicating the code is not obfuscated.\n\n4. **Scores Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The \"securityRisk\" scores are all 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The \"malware\" scores are 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0.0, matching the straightforward code.\n   - The \"risk\" scores are all 0.0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential for Reassessment:**\n   - Since the code is static and has no malicious indicators, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Summary & My Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI utility that simply outputs static package info and version details. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are needed.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current code and reports, there are no security concerns.",
