  "purpose": "A CLI script providing static package info and version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.argv for '--version' argument; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to printing version; otherwise prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static CLI utility that outputs predefined package information or version number. It reads command-line arguments but does not process untrusted input beyond a simple check. No external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals point to benign behavior, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
