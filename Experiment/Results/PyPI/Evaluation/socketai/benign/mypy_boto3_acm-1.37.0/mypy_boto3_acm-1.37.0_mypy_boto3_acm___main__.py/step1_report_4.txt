{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout; no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument, then flows to print_version() or print_info(), which output static information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code uses static strings and standard library functions. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only handles displaying static package info and version number based on command-line input. It does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems beyond printing static data. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The structure is simple and conventional. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or complex behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script intended for informational purposes. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
