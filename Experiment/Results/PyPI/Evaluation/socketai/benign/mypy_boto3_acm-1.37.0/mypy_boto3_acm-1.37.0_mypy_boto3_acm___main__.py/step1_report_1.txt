  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 ACM stub documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, which could potentially be manipulated if untrusted data were injected into the output strings, but in this code, the strings are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() and outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling; the code solely prints static information. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point that handles command-line arguments to print static package information or version details. No input sanitization or dynamic code execution occurs. The data printed is hardcoded, and there are no external dependencies or network calls involved. The logic is simple, with clear control flow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The structure is clean and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for informational purposes only, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
