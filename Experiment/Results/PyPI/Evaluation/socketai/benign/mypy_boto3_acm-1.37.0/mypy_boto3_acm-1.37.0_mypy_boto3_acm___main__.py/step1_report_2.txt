{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package related to boto3 ACM type annotations, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Writes version and info strings to stdout.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is provided, calls print_version() which outputs the version. Otherwise, calls print_info() which outputs package details. Data flows from input (command-line args) to conditional logic, then to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments and output streams. It defines two functions, print_info() and print_version(), both of which output static, informational strings. The main() function checks for the presence of '--version' in sys.argv; if found, it prints the version, otherwise, it prints package information. The script executes main() if run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activities. The code is simple, well-structured, and only outputs static data without any external data handling or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as an informational CLI tool that outputs static package details and version info. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
