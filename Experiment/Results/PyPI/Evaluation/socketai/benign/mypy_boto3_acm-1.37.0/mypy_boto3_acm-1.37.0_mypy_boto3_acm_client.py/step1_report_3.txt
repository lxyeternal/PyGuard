{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS ACM service, intended to facilitate type-safe interactions with AWS ACM via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore modules, internal type definitions, and the class methods that invoke AWS service operations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters with '**kwargs' unpacking request types, method returns, and property accessors.",
  "flows": "Method calls receive untrusted input via '**kwargs' that map to request type definitions; these are then used to interact with AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code primarily defines type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured class definition for the ACM client, with proper type annotations and property/method definitions aligned with the AWS SDK. It imports necessary modules and defines exception classes, client methods, and property accessors. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The use of '**kwargs' for method parameters aligns with standard practice for dynamic request building in boto3, and no suspicious patterns like hidden network calls, code obfuscation, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation and client wrapper for AWS ACM, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It primarily serves to enable type safety and documentation for AWS service interactions.",
