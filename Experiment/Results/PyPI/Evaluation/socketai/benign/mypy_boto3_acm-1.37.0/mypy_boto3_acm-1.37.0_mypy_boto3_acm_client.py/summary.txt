  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by its static, interface-only nature. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content."
