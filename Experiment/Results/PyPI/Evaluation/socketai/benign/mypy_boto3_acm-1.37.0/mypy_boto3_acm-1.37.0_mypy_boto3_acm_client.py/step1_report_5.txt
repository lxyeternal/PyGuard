{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS ACM service, providing structured access to ACM API methods with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local module files; class and method definitions; string literals for operation and waiter names.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data sinks involved; no untrusted data being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Method signatures with type annotations suggest flow from input parameters (unpacked request types) to AWS API calls; no actual data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly defines types and method signatures without dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated client wrapper for AWS ACM, using standard Python and boto3 conventions. It imports necessary modules, defines an Exceptions class for error types, and an ACMClient class with methods mapping to ACM API operations. No suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed. The use of string literals for operation names and type annotations for request/response types aligns with standard SDK stub patterns. No signs of backdoors, hidden network communications, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK client wrapper with type annotations for AWS ACM operations. No malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are identified. It is safe based on the provided content.",
