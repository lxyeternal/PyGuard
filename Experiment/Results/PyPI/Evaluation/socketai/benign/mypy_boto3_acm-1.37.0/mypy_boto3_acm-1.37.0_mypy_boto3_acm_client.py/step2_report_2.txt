  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type-annotated SDK client for AWS ACM, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Issues Present:** No, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface.\n- **Reasoning & Logic:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily type annotations and method signatures, with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n  \n**Assessment:** The low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the absence of malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0. as no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a benign, type-safe interface with no malicious intent.\n- **Issues Present:** No.\n- **Reasoning & Logic:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is purely interface definitions, with no data processing or external data reads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk and malware scores are appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a type-annotated client for AWS ACM, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Issues Present:** No.\n- **Reasoning & Logic:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is standard SDK interface code with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The very low risk score is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS ACM, no malicious code.\n- **Issues Present:** No.\n- **Reasoning & Logic:** Correctly notes that the code is straightforward, with no embedded malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SDK client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Issues Present:** No.\n- **Reasoning & Logic:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature—no suspicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malicious code present. I agree with a malware score of 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated. Obfuscated score should be 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity, I concur with these low scores.\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** Very low (0.1-0.2), justified by the purely interface-based, type-annotated nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are reasonable. The code is a standard, safe SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (average, consistent with the reports)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is benign and safe.",
