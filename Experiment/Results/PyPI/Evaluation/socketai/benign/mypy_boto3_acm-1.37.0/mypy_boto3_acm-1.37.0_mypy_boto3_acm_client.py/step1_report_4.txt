{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) client interface, providing type safety and documentation links for the boto3 ACM client.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class definitions and method signatures; property and method implementations with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters that unpack request types; property and method return values; potential data flows from input parameters to return values or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) unpacked into request type definitions, leading to method logic (not shown) that likely interacts with AWS services; no explicit external data flows or network calls visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is primarily type annotations, class structure, and method signatures with documentation links. No code performs network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type-annotated class for AWS ACM client, including property, method signatures, and exception definitions. It uses standard Python typing and boto3 conventions. No embedded malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, serving as an interface for AWS ACM SDK with proper type hints and documentation references.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type stub for the AWS ACM boto3 client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface layer to facilitate type checking and documentation, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
