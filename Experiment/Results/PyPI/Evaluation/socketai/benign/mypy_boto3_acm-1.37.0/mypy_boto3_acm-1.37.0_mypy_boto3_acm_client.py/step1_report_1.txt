  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for AWS ACM service, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries, third-party packages, and local modules; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types, particularly where untrusted data could influence AWS API calls or generate URLs.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions flow into AWS API requests, and responses flow back to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. Use of type hints and property methods is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type annotations for AWS ACM client interactions. It defines a class inheriting from BaseClient, with methods corresponding to AWS API operations, using type definitions for request and response data. The class exposes exception types and client methods with appropriate type hints. No code appears to perform malicious actions, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only potential concern is that the methods generate URLs or handle untrusted input, but this is standard for SDK clients and relies on AWS API endpoints, not malicious code. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured SDK client definition with type annotations for AWS ACM. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, secure interface for AWS service interactions.",
