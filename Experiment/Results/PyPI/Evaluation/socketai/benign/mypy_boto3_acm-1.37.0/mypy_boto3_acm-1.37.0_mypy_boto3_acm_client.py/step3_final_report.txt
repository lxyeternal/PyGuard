  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for AWS ACM SDK interface, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, type definitions, and method signatures with '**kwargs' unpacking.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions flow into AWS API calls; responses flow back. No external data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Source data (method parameters) flow into AWS API calls; responses flow back to caller. No suspicious data manipulation or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of standard boto3 interface patterns and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK interface with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling is present. The use of '**kwargs' is standard for boto3. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code's purpose is to provide type safety and documentation for AWS ACM client interactions. The absence of any suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious code indicates a benign and safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by its static, interface-only nature. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
