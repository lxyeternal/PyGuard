  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The purpose is to define type annotations and client class for AWS ACM. Sources are standard imports and class definitions. No external data sources or untrusted input are involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method parameters unpacked from type definitions flow into AWS API calls; responses flow back. No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code is a standard SDK interface with type hints.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95), no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is a legitimate SDK stub.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is low (~0.2), matching the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with no external data sources or suspicious imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only method signatures and property definitions; no actual logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is purely a type annotation interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), no malware or security issues.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware score 0, security risk minimal (~0.0), consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines the AWS ACM client with type annotations. No external or untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses '**kwargs' unpacking, standard for boto3 SDK, with no direct data manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It’s a standard interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware or malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is low (~0.1), consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; standard SDK interface with proper type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external data writes.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses string literals for operation names, typical for SDK stubs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), no malware or security concerns.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware score 0, security risk very low (~0.1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, defining a type-safe SDK wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method signatures with type annotations; no actual logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (~0.9), no malware.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware score 0, security risk minimal (~0.1).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code being a standard SDK stub.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as a type annotation and interface layer, not executing any risky operations.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a set of type annotations and method signatures for AWS ACM SDK interactions.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of '**kwargs' and type hints is standard for boto3 SDK stubs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or network operations are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential misuse of method parameters, but no actual risk in the code itself)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is a legitimate, secure SDK interface with no malicious intent.",
