  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS ACM service, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS Certificate Manager API.",
  "sources": "The code sources include imported modules, class attributes, method parameters, and documentation strings. No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations and property definitions are placeholders with no actual execution logic; they are meant for API interfacing. No data is being written to external systems, files, or network in this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines method signatures and property accessors for API calls, but lacks actual runtime data flows. It serves as an interface template, not an execution path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code strictly defines type annotations and interface methods, referencing AWS SDK documentation for context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured definition of a client class for AWS ACM, including type annotations, property methods, and documentation links. It imports standard and third-party modules appropriately based on Python version, and defines exception classes. There is no executable logic beyond method signatures, and no data processing, external data reads, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface definition for AWS ACM SDK bindings with type annotations, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as a type-safe wrapper around AWS SDK functions, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
