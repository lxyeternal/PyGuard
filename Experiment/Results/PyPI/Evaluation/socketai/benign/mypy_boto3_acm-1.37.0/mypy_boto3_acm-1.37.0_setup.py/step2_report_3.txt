  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, or external inputs are involved.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and uses common practices.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk is 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?** None. The reasoning is sound, and the code is typical for a setup script.\n- **Scores assigned?** All are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which seems reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future but not malicious. It's just an inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this setup script as safe, with no malicious or obfuscated code, and assign appropriate scores. The code is a typical, static package configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
