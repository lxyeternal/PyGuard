{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-acm' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static package and metadata definitions; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no code execution, network, or file operations based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script purely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of static paths and metadata is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No input validation or external data processing occurs. The dependencies are statically defined, and no potentially malicious code or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without external data processing or security concerns.",
