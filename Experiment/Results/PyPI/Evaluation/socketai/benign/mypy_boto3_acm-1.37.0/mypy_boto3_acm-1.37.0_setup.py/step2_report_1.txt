  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- Metadata such as name, version, author, URL, classifiers, dependencies, and package data are hardcoded.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code structures are evident.\n- The only potential anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct and typical for a setup script.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is correct; no malicious activity is detected.\n  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **confidence** is 1 in all reports, justified by the clear and standard nature of the script.\n- The **scores are consistent** across reports.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The **future copyright year (2025)** is unusual but not malicious or risky.\n- The **dependency on `typing-extensions`** with a version condition is standard practice for compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate.\n- No issues, anomalies, or risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the reports as accurate. No further action needed.",
