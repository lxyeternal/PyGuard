{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up the 'mypy-boto3-acm' package, including metadata and dependencies, for distribution via Python's setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing 'setuptools' for setup functions, and reading package metadata from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks such as network or file writes beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the setup configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using 'setuptools' to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads the README.md for description and specifies dependencies based on Python version. There are no dynamic inputs, external data processing, or suspicious code structures. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
