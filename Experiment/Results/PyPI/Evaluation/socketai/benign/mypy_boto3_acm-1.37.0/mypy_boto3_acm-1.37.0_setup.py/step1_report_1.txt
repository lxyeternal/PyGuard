{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-acm', defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' to get the long description; reads package data; reads package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content and uses it in package setup; processes package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local markdown file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No external data is fetched at runtime; no execution of untrusted code occurs. All data appears hardcoded and standard for Python packaging. The package dependencies are limited to specified versions; no dynamic or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
