  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-acm, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static metadata fields; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with static data and no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local file for description, specifies dependencies, and metadata. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
