  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the ACM service, exporting clients, waiters, and paginators.",
  "sources": "Static imports and documentation; no runtime data or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "None; as this is a static module, there are no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static interface module, importing components and defining exports. The provided reports citing 'Empty response' are likely referencing external API interactions or runtime logs, not the static code itself. No network calls, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present in this snippet. Therefore, the reports do not reflect actual issues within this code. The malware score is zero, and risk is minimal due to lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The static code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or insecure elements. The 'Empty response' reports are unrelated to this code snippet and should be considered false positives or external issues. Overall, there is no evidence of security threats or malware in this static module.",
