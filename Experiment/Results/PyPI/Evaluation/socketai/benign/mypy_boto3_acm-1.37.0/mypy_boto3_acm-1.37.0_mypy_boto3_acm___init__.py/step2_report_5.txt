  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nThe reports all indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since the code provided is a straightforward module defining imports and exports, there is no dynamic response or network interaction shown here. The code itself does not perform any operations that could produce responses, so \"Empty response\" reports are likely referencing external interactions or perhaps a misinterpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The code itself does not produce responses; thus, the \"Empty response\" reports do not directly reflect issues within this code snippet.  \n- If these reports pertain to an external API call or runtime behavior not shown here, then the problem might be elsewhere, not in this static code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**  \n- The reports lack detail: they only state \"Empty response\" without context or raw response data.  \n- No indication of what triggered these responses or what operations were attempted.  \n- Without more context, these reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The reports seem to lack sufficient detail to evaluate the cause of \"Empty response.\"  \n- They may not be valid issues in this static code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no other information.  \n- If the scoring system assigns a high risk score for \"Empty response\" without context, that would be unreasonable.  \n- Since no actual code or runtime data is provided, assigning high risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- Reduce the scores to near zero unless additional context indicates a real problem.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5)**  \n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or exploitable issues is present.  \n- The code is a simple interface module with no network or data processing logic that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Risk scores should remain low, close to zero, unless further details suggest otherwise.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.  \n- The reports do not provide evidence of malware.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Malware score should be zero.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports seem to assume issues based solely on \"Empty response\" without context.  \n- Without concrete evidence, these claims are speculative.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**  \n- Given the lack of detail, any high scores would be inconsistent.  \n- The reports appear to be placeholders or incomplete.\n\n**Overall Summary:**  \n- The code itself is straightforward and appears secure.  \n- The reports lack sufficient detail to justify any concern.  \n- The \"Empty response\" reports do not seem to indicate actual issues in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to lack of detail)  \n\n**Note:**  \nIf these reports are meant to flag runtime issues or external API responses, they are insufficiently detailed. Without additional context, no real security concern is evident.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Request more detailed logs or responses to evaluate the true nature of these reports.  \n- Confirm whether these \"Empty response\" reports originate from runtime behavior, external API calls, or misinterpretations.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code appears clean and secure; the reports are inconclusive and should not influence a high-risk assessment.",
