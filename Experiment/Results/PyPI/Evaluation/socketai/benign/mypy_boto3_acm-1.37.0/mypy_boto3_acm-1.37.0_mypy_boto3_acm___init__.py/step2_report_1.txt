  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports indicate an \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since the provided code is a static module definition (imports, documentation, and exports), it does not perform any network operations or API calls. Therefore, an \"Empty response\" issue cannot originate from this code snippet itself.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports do not reflect actual issues within this code; they seem to be placeholders or misinterpretations.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \n- The reports only mention \"Empty response\" with no additional context or raw response data.  \n- There is no evidence that the code attempts any network operation or API call that could produce such responses.  \n- Given the static nature of this module, these reports appear to be either generic placeholders or misapplied error reports.\n\n**Flaw in reasoning:**  \nAssuming the \"Empty response\" errors relate directly to this code is flawed because this code does not execute any network requests. If these reports are meant to indicate runtime issues, they are misplaced or incorrectly generated.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue.**  \n- The scores are not explicitly provided, but given the context, any assigned scores should be very low or zero because no actual code execution or network activity is involved.  \n- If any higher scores are assigned, they are unreasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- All issues should have a risk score close to 0, indicating no real threat or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \n- No actual issues are present in the code, and no network interactions are performed here.  \n- Therefore, any high risk score is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations.**  \n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.  \n- No malware behavior is evident or implied.  \n- The \"Empty response\" reports do not suggest malware.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Malware score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \n- The reports seem to assume that \"Empty response\" indicates a problem with the code or potential vulnerability, but without context or actual execution logs, these are baseless assumptions.  \n- The code is a straightforward module with no runtime logic that could produce such responses.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report.**  \n- Since no real issues are present, scores should reflect that.  \n- If any scores are higher, they are inconsistent with the static, non-executing nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimate:**\n\nThis code is a static interface module, providing documentation and class exports. The reports of \"Empty response\" are not applicable here—they do not stem from the code itself. The issues are false positives or misinterpretations.\n\n**Overall recommendations:**  \n- The reports should be dismissed or marked as not applicable.  \n- If scores are assigned, they should be minimal, reflecting no actual risk.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways verify the context of such reports—if they come from runtime logs or static analysis tools, the actual source of \"Empty response\" errors should be identified outside this static code review.",
