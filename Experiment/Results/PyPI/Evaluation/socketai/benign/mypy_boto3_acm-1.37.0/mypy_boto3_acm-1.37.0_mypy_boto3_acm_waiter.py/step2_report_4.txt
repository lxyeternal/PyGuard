  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a straightforward subclass with type annotations for AWS ACM waiters, with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed is a subclass of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with a `wait()` method that accepts kwargs typed with `Unpack[DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef]`. It uses conditional import for `Unpack` based on Python version. No suspicious logic, data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and purely for type safety.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code as a benign extension for boto3 waiters, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code structure is identical in purpose and logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the code as a type annotation wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Same observations as above; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a benign subclass with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses; the code is a simple, well-structured subclass for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—type annotations and subclassing for AWS ACM waiters, with no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe the same or very similar code: a subclass of `botocore.waiter.Waiter` with a `wait()` method accepting unpacked kwargs typed with `DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef`. The code is designed for type safety, documentation, and interface clarity.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No handling of untrusted data, no network or file operations, no secrets hardcoded.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Justification:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, primarily serving as a type-safe interface extension for boto3 waiters. The code's purpose is documentation and type annotation, with no data processing or external interactions that could pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard, and well-structured type annotation subclass with no security concerns.",
