{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and a custom waiter class for the AWS ACM service client to facilitate waiting for certificate validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; code reading class definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method calls the parent class Waiter.wait(), which may process untrusted data in its internal implementation, but this code does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to wait() are unpacked from DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef, passed directly to the parent wait() method without processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is primarily type annotations and a subclass definition, with no data leaks or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of boto3's Waiter with a custom wait() method that forwards parameters to the parent implementation. It includes type annotations for better type safety and documentation links. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be a straightforward type-safe wrapper for a boto3 waiter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and wrapper class for AWS ACM waiters. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network activity, and no security risks. It is a utility module for type safety and documentation, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
