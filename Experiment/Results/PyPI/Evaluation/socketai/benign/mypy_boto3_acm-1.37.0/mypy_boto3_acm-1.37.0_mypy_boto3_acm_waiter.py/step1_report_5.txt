  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for ACM service client waiters in boto3, providing a typed interface for waiting on certificate validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and a local type definitions module; usage examples in docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines a class with a method that wraps an external library call without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is mainly type annotations and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 ACM waiter class, including a subclass 'CertificateValidatedWaiter' that overrides the 'wait' method. It imports necessary modules, including conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version, and contains only documentation and class definitions. No user input handling, data transmission, or executable code with potential malicious intent is present. The code appears standard for a type-stub or typed interface layer, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation module defining a subclass for ACM waiters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It functions as a typing aid for boto3 waiters, with no indications of malware or security issues.",
