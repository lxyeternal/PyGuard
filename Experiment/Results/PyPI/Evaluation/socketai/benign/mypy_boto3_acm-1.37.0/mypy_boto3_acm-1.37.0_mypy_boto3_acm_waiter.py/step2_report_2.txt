  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and subclass for AWS ACM waiters.\n- Sources & sinks: Standard imports; no untrusted data.\n- Flows: Input kwargs are unpacked and passed internally.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Straightforward subclassing with documentation links; no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for ACM waiters.\n- Sources & sinks: No untrusted data or external leaks.\n- Flows: Input parameters unpacked; no malicious data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Standard subclass with no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and class for ACM waiters.\n- Sources & sinks: No untrusted data processing.\n- Flows: Parameters passed directly to parent method.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Purely for type safety; no malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and custom waiter class.\n- Sources & sinks: No data leaks or malicious data.\n- Flows: Parameters forwarded without processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Utility wrapper, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and class extension.\n- Sources & sinks: No data leaks or untrusted input.\n- Flows: Class methods wrapping external library calls.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & conclusion: Standard type stub for boto3, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward type annotation and subclassing pattern for boto3 waiters.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no security risk is present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for type safety, documentation, and extending boto3 waiters with proper type annotations.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The conditional import for `Unpack` based on Python version is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- The class and method structures are typical for type stubs or interface wrappers.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the reported scores are necessary. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and purely for type annotations and class extension purposes.",
