  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, potential issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines a subclass `CertificateValidatedWaiter` of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`.\n- It provides a `wait()` method with type annotations, accepting `**kwargs` unpacked from `DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef`.\n- It includes conditional import for `Unpack` based on Python version.\n- The code is well-documented, referencing both boto3 and custom documentation.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external data handling is evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward type annotation and subclassing utility for AWS ACM waiters.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are detected in the code. It is a standard, benign subclass with type annotations and documentation links.\n- **Code logic:** No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Security risks:** No security risks are present; the code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0` or very low (e.g., 0.1). Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- **Confidence levels:** Ranging from 0.9 to 1.0, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n- **Any overestimation?** No, the scores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code's purpose is solely to provide type annotations and a subclass for AWS ACM waiters.\n- The documentation links and usage examples reinforce its benign intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's transparent, utility-focused nature.",
