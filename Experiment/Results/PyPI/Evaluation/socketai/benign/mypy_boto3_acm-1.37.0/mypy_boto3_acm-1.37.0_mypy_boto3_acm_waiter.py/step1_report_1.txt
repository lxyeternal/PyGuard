  "purpose": "Type annotations and a subclass for AWS ACM service client waiters to facilitate waiting for certificate validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, botocore.waiter.Waiter, type_defs.DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef, and standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "The wait method accepts **kwargs with type Unpack[DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef], which are used internally by botocore.waiter.Waiter.wait.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) are unpacked and passed to the parent wait method; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code contains standard subclassing, type annotations, and documentation links. No hardcoded secrets, unusual behaviors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of botocore.waiter.Waiter specifically for ACM certificate validation. It uses conditional import for Unpack based on Python version. The wait method overrides the parent method and uses type annotations for input parameters, with documentation links for reference. No suspicious logic, external data handling, or malicious constructs are present. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and subclassing code intended for type safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign subclass providing type annotations and documentation links for AWS ACM waiter. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
