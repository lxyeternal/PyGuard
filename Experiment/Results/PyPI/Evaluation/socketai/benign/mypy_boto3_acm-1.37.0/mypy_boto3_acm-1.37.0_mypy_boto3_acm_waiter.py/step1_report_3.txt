{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations for ACM service client waiters, facilitating static type checking and IDE support for boto3 ACM waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and a local type_defs module; usage of sys.version_info for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method is a sink where input parameters (kwargs) are unpacked using Unpack from type_defs, but no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs (from caller) flow into the wait() method and are unpacked via Unpack; no further processing or data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code primarily defines a subclass and method with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-safe wrapper subclass of Waiter with a wait() method that accepts unpacked parameters from a predefined type. Conditional imports handle different Python versions. The code relies on external boto3 and botocore libraries and local type definitions. There are no signs of malicious actions, data leaks, or backdoors. It serves purely as a type annotation and interface enhancement for boto3 waiters.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type annotation wrapper for boto3 ACM waiters, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and intended for improving static type checking support.",
