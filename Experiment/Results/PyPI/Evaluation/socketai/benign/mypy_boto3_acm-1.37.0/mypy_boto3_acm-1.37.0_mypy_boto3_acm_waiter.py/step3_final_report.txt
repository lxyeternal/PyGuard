  "purpose": "Type annotations and subclass for AWS ACM waiters to provide type safety and documentation support.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.waiter and type_defs; no untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; method parameters are unpacked kwargs.",
  "flows": "kwargs unpacked from DescribeCertificateRequestWaitTypeDef and passed to parent wait method.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard subclassing with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of botocore.waiter.Waiter with a wait() method annotated for type safety, using conditional import for Unpack based on Python version. It includes documentation links and serves as a utility for static analysis or IDE support. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no data leaks, network activity, or secrets. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its benign, utility-focused purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation subclass for AWS ACM waiters, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
