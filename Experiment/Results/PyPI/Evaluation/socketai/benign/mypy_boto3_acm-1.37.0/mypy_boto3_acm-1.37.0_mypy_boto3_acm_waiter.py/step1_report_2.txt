  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for ACM service client waiters in boto3, specifically for the 'certificate validated' waiter.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, botocore.waiter.Waiter, and local type definitions; class method wait's parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward, primarily type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a subclass of Waiter for handling certificate validation wait operations. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, which is standard. The wait method accepts flexible parameters with proper type annotations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is purely for type annotations and class extension, with references to documentation for validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign extension for boto3 waiters with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type-safe wrapper for AWS ACM waiters, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
