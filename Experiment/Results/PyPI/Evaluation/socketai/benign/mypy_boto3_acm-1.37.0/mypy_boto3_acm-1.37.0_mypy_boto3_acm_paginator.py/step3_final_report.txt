  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for boto3 ACM client, specifically for list_certificates.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class inheritance and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; static class and method definitions.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance from Paginator, method paginate accepting kwargs with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import for Unpack based on Python version; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static type stub for boto3's ACM paginator, with proper documentation links, conditional imports, and class extension. It does not process data, execute network calls, or contain dynamic code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, purely structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for boto3 ACM paginators, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; minor adjustment could be lowering the risk score in report 5 from 0.1 to 0 for consistency, but overall, the code is safe.",
