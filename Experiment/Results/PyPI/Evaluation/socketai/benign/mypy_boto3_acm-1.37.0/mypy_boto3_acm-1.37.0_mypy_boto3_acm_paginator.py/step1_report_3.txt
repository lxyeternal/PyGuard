  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for ACM service client in boto3, providing type-safe access to the 'list_certificates' paginator.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method 'paginate' with kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Method 'paginate' that accepts unpacked kwargs; no direct sinks for untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "User calls 'client.get_paginator' -> invokes 'paginate' method with kwargs -> returns a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of type hints and conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator subclass with type annotations, imports necessary modules, and conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version. The 'paginate' method correctly annotates input kwargs and return type. No external data input, insecure operations, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's paginator functionality, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation module for AWS ACM paginator; it contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a safe, functional part of a larger SDK wrapper.",
