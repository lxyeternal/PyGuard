{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator subclass for ACM service client in boto3, providing type hints and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method 'paginate' with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause security effects; no data leaks or external calls based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' method accepts kwargs of type ListCertificatesRequestPaginateTypeDef, passes them to the parent class method, returning a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard type hinting, subclassing, and documentation linking without obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator class for ACM list_certificates with type annotations, conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >=3.12, and extends a base Paginator class. It contains only documentation links, type hints, and straightforward method overriding. No untrusted data handling, external data processing, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated paginator subclass for boto3 ACM client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for typing and documentation purposes.",
