{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a paginator class wrapper for the AWS ACM service's 'list_certificates' operation in boto3, intended to improve type safety and developer experience when using AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; reads version info from sys and type definitions from type_defs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or network operations; no data leaks or malicious actions observed.",
  "flows": "Uses version info to conditionally import Unpack; defines a class that inherits from a generic paginator, with the paginate method accepting unpacked request parameters, returning a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Conditional import based on Python version is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation wrapper for a boto3 paginator class, with conditional imports based on Python version. It contains no network operations, no data manipulation, or security-sensitive logic. The class and method are standard implementations following AWS SDK patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code serves a purely structural and documentation purpose, with no external data or command execution involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and wrapper class for AWS SDK paginator functionality. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security assessment is very low.",
