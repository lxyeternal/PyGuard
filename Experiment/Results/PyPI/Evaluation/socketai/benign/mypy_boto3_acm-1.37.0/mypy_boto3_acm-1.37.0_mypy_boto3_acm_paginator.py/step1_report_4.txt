{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the ACM service client in boto3, facilitating static type checking and improved code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version from sys.version_info, imports modules from typing, botocore, and local type definitions, and references the paginator parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data, and there are no untrusted input or output operations. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves defining a paginator class that extends botocore's Paginator, with a method 'paginate' that accepts unpacked request parameters and returns a PageIterator. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is purely type annotation and class extension without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up type annotations for boto3 ACM paginators, using conditional imports based on Python version, and defines a paginator class that extends botocore's Paginator. The code only contains imports, class definitions, and method signatures, with no runtime data handling or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure and content align with standard type annotation practices for boto3 stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 ACM paginators. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
