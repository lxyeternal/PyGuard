  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for the ACM service client in boto3, aiding static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods accessing boto3 client paginator.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external data output identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard use of Python typing and class inheritance for boto3 paginator extension.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a paginator class for boto3 ACM list_certificates, with conditional imports based on Python version. It uses type hints and follows boto3 documentation standards. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward, serving as a type-safe wrapper for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type annotation and class definition module for AWS ACM paginator, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
