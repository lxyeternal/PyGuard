  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code consists solely of static type annotations, data structure definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation strings.\n- There are no runtime functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK type stub module for AWS ACM, intended for type checking and documentation.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- Given the static, purely structural nature of the code, **malware score should be 0**.\n- The code is not obfuscated; it uses standard Python practices for compatibility and type annotations, so **obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n**Risk Score Justification:**\n- The risk score should reflect the potential for malicious activity or security impact.\n- Since there is no malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no code injection, and no external interactions, **risk score should be 0**.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and solely for type definitions.\n- They mention no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns.\n- The confidence level in each report is 1, which aligns with the assessment that the code is safe.\n\n**Any discrepancies or concerns?**\n- No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS ACM SDK interactions.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a well-structured, standard set of type definitions with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It serves its purpose for type safety and documentation in SDK development without introducing any security risks.",
