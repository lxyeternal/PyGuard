  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature and the criteria for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a collection of Python type annotations and data structure definitions (TypedDicts, Unions, constants).\n- It imports standard libraries, external libraries (botocore.response), and internal literals.\n- Conditional imports for Python version compatibility are present.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or runtime operations are included.\n- No external data sources, user input handling, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code serves as a static SDK type stub for AWS ACM, primarily for type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware Score Evaluation**\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- No code executes dynamic operations.\n- No code injection, system commands, or network activity.\n- No suspicious patterns or payloads.\n- No obfuscation or hiding techniques.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Malware score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Obfuscated Score Evaluation**\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- The code uses standard practices for compatibility (`sys.version_info` checks).\n- No minified or intentionally obscured code.\n- No use of encoding, base64, or other obfuscation techniques.\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Obfuscated score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Security Risk / Overall Risk Score Evaluation**\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- The code is purely static type definitions.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The purpose is to aid static type checking, not to perform any operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Risk score: 0** is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Overall Security Risk | 0   |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static collection of type annotations for AWS ACM SDK in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All patterns are standard, and the purpose is clear: to provide type safety and documentation support.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the assessments provided in the reports.**",
