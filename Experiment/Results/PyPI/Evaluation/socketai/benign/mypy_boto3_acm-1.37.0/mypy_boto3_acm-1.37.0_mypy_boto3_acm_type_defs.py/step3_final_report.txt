  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS ACM SDK in Python, serving as static type hints and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static code, no runtime data sources or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No runtime flows; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no executable functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. It functions as a type stub for AWS ACM SDK, intended for type safety and documentation. The absence of runtime logic or external interactions indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS ACM SDK in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports correctly identify it as a safe, documentation-oriented module. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, which are appropriate given its static nature.",
