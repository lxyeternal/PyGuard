  "purpose": "Type definitions for ACM service API interactions, mainly used for type safety and clarity in boto3-based code.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, third-party libraries (botocore, typing_extensions), and internal literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are used for static type checking; no runtime data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and well-defined type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely dedicated to defining data structures with type annotations for AWS ACM service. It uses conditional imports based on Python version and does not execute any dynamic code or system commands. No indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations. No code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity is present. The code adheres to standard type definition practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for AWS ACM SDK interactions. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
