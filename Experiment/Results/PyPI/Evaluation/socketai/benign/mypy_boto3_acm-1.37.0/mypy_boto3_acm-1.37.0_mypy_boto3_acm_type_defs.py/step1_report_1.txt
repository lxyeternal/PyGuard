  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS ACM service SDK in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, type annotations, and constants; definitions of TypedDicts and type unions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing; the code mainly defines data structures and type hints.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses version checks and conditional imports, which are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for AWS ACM SDK responses and requests. It uses standard Python typing, conditional imports for compatibility, and imports from external libraries for constants. There are no data processing or logic flows, no code injection, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All elements serve the purpose of type safety and documentation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and data structures for AWS ACM SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is intended for type checking and code clarity, not for executing untrusted operations.",
