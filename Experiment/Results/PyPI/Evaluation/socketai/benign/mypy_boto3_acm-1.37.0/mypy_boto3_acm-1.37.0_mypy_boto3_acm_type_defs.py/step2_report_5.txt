  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a set of static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS ACM SDK in Python.\n- It uses standard Python typing, conditional imports for compatibility, and imports from external libraries for constants.\n- There are no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The purpose is primarily for type safety, documentation, and SDK development.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** No issues, no malicious behavior, purely type definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, emphasizes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the static, type-only nature. No dynamic or malicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Same consistent conclusion. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard type definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Observations**\n\n- **Code Content:** Static type definitions, no executable logic, no data flows from untrusted sources.\n- **Malware Potential:** None detected. The code is purely structural.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent. The code does not perform any actions beyond type annotations.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at **0**. Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at **0**. No security risk identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for AWS ACM SDK in Python**. It serves as documentation and type safety aid, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that type definition files like this are not dynamically generated or altered at runtime from untrusted sources. In this case, static code analysis confirms no such issues.",
