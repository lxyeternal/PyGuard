{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions and data structures for the AWS ACM service SDK, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imported types, and class definitions; no external untrusted data inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only defines types and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code is purely type annotation definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, type definitions using TypedDict and Union, and documentation strings. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. It adheres to standard Python typing practices for SDK type definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS ACM SDK usage. It appears to be a benign, purely structural module with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks.",
