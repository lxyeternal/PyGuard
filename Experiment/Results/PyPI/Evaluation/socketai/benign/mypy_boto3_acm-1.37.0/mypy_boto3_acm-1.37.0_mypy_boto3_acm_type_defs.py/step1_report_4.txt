  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS ACM service requests and responses to support static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (botocore.response), and internal modules (.literals). No user input or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code only defines types and structures.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static type annotations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and other typing constructs. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, but no dynamic execution, code injection, or data processing logic. All the code is static type definitions for AWS ACM SDK responses and requests, with no external or user data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type definition module for AWS ACM, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could be malicious. The structure and content are consistent with typical SDK type stubs.",
