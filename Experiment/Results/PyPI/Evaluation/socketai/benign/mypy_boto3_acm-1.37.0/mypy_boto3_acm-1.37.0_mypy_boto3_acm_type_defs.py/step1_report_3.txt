{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for AWS ACM service interactions, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Type definitions for request/response data structures, type annotations, and imported modules such as sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or security-critical operations are present. The code primarily involves data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source definitions (inputs and imports) into typed dictionaries and type annotations, with no execution or data manipulation logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static type definitions with no executable code or dynamic data handling. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility. It imports and uses external types from other modules and standard library features. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, no network operations, and no code injection mechanisms. The code does not interact with untrusted sources or perform any actions that could be malicious. The presence of license or attribution comments and type definitions suggests this is a standard SDK type stub module. Overall, the code is benign, static, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of type definitions and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a type hinting and documentation aid for AWS ACM service interactions. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security threats are detected.",
