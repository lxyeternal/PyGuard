  "sources": "The code reads static string assignment (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") and a comment block at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment and a simple variable assignment to specify the package version. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communications are present. The static version string and the comment do not pose any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
