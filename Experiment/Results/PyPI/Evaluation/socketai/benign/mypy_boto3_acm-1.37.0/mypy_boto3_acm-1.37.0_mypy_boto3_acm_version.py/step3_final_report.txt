  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control and metadata.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, accompanied by a comment. It contains no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or outputs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
