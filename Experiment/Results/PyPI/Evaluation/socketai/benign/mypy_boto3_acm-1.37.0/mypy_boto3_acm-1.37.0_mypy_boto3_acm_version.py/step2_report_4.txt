  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__` with no external input, output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and serves as metadata.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence, justified)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code has no dynamic behavior, no external dependencies, no input/output, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as a simple version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static version string declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign and standard. The current scores are accurate. No changes needed.",
