  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a static value.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the comment indicating 'Source of truth for version' and the copyright notice. The version number is hardcoded but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable, with a comment explaining its purpose. The copyright notice is informational. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or suspicious constructs. The code appears standard for a version definition module, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as a static reference for package versioning.",
