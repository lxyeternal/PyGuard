  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` with a comment block.\n   - There are no external inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no external data sources, and no executable logic.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to declare a static version string.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code is consistent with common practices for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and contains no dynamic or external elements, the risk of malicious behavior is effectively zero.\n   - The comments and copyright notice are standard and do not introduce any security concerns.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all analyses correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, static version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports' evaluations are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of this code snippet.",
