{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated alias for importing from an internal module, encouraging users to update their import statements.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, the function __getattr__ dynamically retrieves attributes from the 'rendering' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data or malicious activity are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the deprecated import warning to dynamic attribute access, which simply forwards attribute retrieval to the internal module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are observed. The code only issues a warning and forwards attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning when attributes are accessed, guiding users to update import paths. It dynamically retrieves attributes from an internal module without executing untrusted code or external data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears standard for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply forwards attribute requests from an old import path to the new location, with a warning. No security issues are evident.",
