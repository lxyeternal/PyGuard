{
  "purpose": "This code implements a module-level __getattr__ to forward attribute access from a deprecated import path to an internal module, issuing a deprecation warning to guide users to update their imports.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattr__, which reads attribute names when accessed, and the import of the 'rendering' module from mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal.",
  "sinks": "The getattr(rendering, name) call exposes attributes of the rendering module, which could include internal or sensitive attributes if present.",
  "flows": "A source is the attribute name accessed; the flow proceeds through __getattr__ to getattr(rendering, name), exposing attributes of the rendering module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward deprecation proxy with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly issues a deprecation warning and forwards attribute access to the internal rendering module. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The pattern is standard for maintaining backward compatibility during refactoring. The only potential concern is exposure of internal attributes if the rendering module contains sensitive data, but this is outside the scope of this code. All reports correctly assign malware score 0 and low security risk (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard deprecation proxy pattern with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score is justified by the dynamic attribute forwarding, which is typical in such scenarios.",
