{
  "purpose": "Define a variable 'example' with a type hint that it can be None or an int or a list of ints.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares a variable with a type hint.",
  "anomalies": "Use of complex type hinting (Optional[Union[...]]), which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typing' modules and declares a variable with a composite type hint. No runtime data processing, external inputs, or outputs are present. The code is purely a type annotation for variable declaration, which is common in Python for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward variable declaration with type annotations and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
