  "purpose": "Type annotation for a variable demonstrating Optional and Union types in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable declaration and type annotation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a variable with type hints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard type annotation syntax used correctly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and assigns a variable with a complex type hint involving Optional, Union, and List. No data input, no untrusted data sources, no dangerous functions, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, adhering to normal Python type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type annotation example without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any operations, input/output, or data handling that could pose security risks.",
