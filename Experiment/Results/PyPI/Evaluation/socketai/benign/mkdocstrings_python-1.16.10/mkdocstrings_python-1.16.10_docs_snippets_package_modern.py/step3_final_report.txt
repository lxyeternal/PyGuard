{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates a variable with a complex type hint using Python's typing module, specifically an optional union of int and list of int.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement of typing constructs and the variable declaration with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is static and only declares a variable with a type hint.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and declares a variable 'example' with a complex type hint, assigning None. It contains no runtime behavior, data processing, or external data handling. The code is purely a static type annotation with no malicious or security-related behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not involve any obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The overall assessment confirms that the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward example of Python type annotations with no security or malicious concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
