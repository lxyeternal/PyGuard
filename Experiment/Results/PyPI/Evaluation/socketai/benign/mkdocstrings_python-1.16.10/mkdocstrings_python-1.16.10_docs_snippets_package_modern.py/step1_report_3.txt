  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of Python type hints to specify a variable that can be an integer, a list of integers, or None.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable assignment for 'example' with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code practices; standard type annotation usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing components and defines a variable with a complex type hint, using Optional and Union to specify multiple types. This is standard practice in Python for static type checking. No data input, external calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign example of Python type hinting with no malicious intent or security risks.",
