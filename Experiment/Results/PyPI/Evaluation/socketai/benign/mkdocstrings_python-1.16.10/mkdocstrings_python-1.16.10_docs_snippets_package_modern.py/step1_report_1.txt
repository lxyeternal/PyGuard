{
  "purpose": "The code defines a type annotation variable named 'example' with a complex union type.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the source code itself where the variable is defined and annotated.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets a type-annotated variable to None.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward type annotation assignment using Python's typing module. It assigns 'None' to a variable with a complex type annotation involving Optional, Union, and List. No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears standard and benign, solely demonstrating type hinting syntax.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is a simple, harmless type annotation example.",
