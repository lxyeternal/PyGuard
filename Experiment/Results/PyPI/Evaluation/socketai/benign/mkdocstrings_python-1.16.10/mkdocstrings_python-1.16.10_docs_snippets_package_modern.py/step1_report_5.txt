{
  "purpose": "Define a variable 'example' with a type hint that allows it to be None, an integer, or a list of integers.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and the assignment of 'example' to None.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code establishes a type annotation for 'example' and assigns it a value of None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard type annotations and a straightforward assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Optional', 'Union', and 'List' from the 'typing' module, which are used for type hinting in Python. It then declares a variable 'example' with a type hint that allows it to be 'Optional[Union[int, List[int]]]', meaning it can be None, an int, or a list of ints. The variable is assigned the value None. There are no functions, user inputs, or external data sources; the code only involves static type hints and assignment. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type annotation and variable assignment using standard Python syntax. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
