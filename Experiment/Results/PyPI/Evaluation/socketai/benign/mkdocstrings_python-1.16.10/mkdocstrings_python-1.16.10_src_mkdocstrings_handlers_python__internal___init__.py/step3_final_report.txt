  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network interactions, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), file reads, request handling.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input leading to code execution, data exfiltration over network, access to environment variables, file system operations, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) -> dynamic execution functions or network communication -> potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, high use of dynamic execution (eval, exec), hardcoded or suspicious variable names, suspicious control flow, obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical in malicious scripts. Reports 1-3 show no suspicious activity, with scores indicating benign behavior. Report 4 suggests potential dynamic code handling and data exfiltration, warranting moderate suspicion; scores are aligned but could be slightly increased if concrete evidence of malicious code is confirmed. Report 5 indicates high obfuscation and suspicious control flow, justifying high obfuscated (0.8) and moderate malware (0.4) scores. Overall, the suspicion levels are consistent with the described patterns, with some room for minor score adjustments if further evidence emerges.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows low risk in benign cases (reports 1-3). Suspicious patterns like obfuscation and dynamic code execution in reports 4 and 5 elevate concern to moderate levels. The overall assessment indicates a moderate threat potential, especially in obfuscated or dynamically executing code, warranting cautious use and further analysis.",
