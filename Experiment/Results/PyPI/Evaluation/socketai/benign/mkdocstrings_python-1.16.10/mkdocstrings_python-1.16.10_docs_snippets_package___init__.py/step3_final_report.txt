  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of a specified Python package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The function calls metadata.version(dist) to get the package version; the package name is a parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function returns a string with the version or a default value.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'dist' flows into metadata.version; exception handling flows to return default string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that safely retrieves package version info, handling missing packages gracefully. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception handling is standard, and the package name is controlled. No external network calls or data leaks are involved. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
