{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the specified Python package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'mkdocstrings-python' from a function parameter and attempts to get its version using importlib.metadata.version().",
  "sinks": "The only output is the version string returned by metadata.version(), which is a benign operation.",
  "flows": "The source is the input parameter 'dist'; the flow goes to importlib.metadata.version() and returns the version string; in case of an exception, it returns '0.0.0'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward retrieval of package version information. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to get a package's version using importlib.metadata, which is a standard practice. It handles exceptions gracefully by returning a default version. The usage of metadata.version() is safe and does not involve untrusted input processing beyond the package name string, which is passed as a parameter. The code appears to serve a utility purpose without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for retrieving package version information. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It is a standard, safe implementation with no signs of malware or security risks.",
