{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of a specified Python distribution package.",
  "sources": "The function get_version reads the distribution name input, and metadata.version accesses package metadata to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or send data over the network; it only reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'dist' flows into metadata.version to obtain version; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard library features without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.metadata to get package version info in a try-except block to handle missing packages gracefully. It reads a package name input and retrieves its version, returning '0.0.0' if not found. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to get a package version, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard in function.",
