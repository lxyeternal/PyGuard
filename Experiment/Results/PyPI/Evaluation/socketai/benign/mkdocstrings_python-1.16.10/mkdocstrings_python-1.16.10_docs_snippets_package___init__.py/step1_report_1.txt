{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the specified Python package 'mkdocstrings-python' using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The function get_version reads the package metadata via metadata.version(dist).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present. No untrusted data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The source (metadata.version call) returns package version info; no further flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs a simple metadata retrieval operation. Exception handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to get the version of a specified package using importlib.metadata. It includes a try-except block to handle cases where the package is not found, returning '0.0.0'. The overall structure is standard and does not include obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The only input is the package name, which is a static string by default. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or code injections.\n\nThe code appears to be a benign utility for version retrieval. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual control flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and serves a benign purpose. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple utility function with no indicators of malicious intent.",
