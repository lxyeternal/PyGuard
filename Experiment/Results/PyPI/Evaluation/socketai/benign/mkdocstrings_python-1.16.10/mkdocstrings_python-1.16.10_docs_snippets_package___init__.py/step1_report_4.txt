  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of a specified Python package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The function get_version reads the package name from its parameter 'dist'. It calls metadata.version which accesses package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The metadata.version call may access package distribution data on the system; no untrusted external input is directly used or propagated.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'dist' flows into metadata.version. The returned version string flows back to the caller. The try-except handles missing packages gracefully.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Exception handling is standard. No external network access or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard importlib.metadata to get package version info, which is a legitimate operation. It handles missing packages gracefully by returning '0.0.0'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical version retrieval functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal utility function for obtaining package version info. No malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected.",
