  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a straightforward utility that retrieves a package version using `importlib.metadata.version()`.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - Exception handling is simple and appropriate.\n   - No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - **Conclusion**: The code is benign and functions as intended.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, safe, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reports appropriately note the absence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion**: The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, such as executing untrusted code, network communication, or handling sensitive data.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores of 0 or 0.5 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - The code simply reads package metadata.\n   - **Conclusion**: Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the actual code behavior, not assumptions.\n   - No unwarranted suspicions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:\n   - The scores align well with the benign assessment.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk detected.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code's purpose is a standard utility for package version retrieval.\n- It uses safe, well-understood Python standard library functions.\n- Exception handling is appropriate and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.               |\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed.",
