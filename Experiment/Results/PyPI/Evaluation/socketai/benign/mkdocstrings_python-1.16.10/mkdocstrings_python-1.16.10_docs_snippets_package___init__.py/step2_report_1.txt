  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility to retrieve package version info using `importlib.metadata`.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The exception handling is standard, returning a default version if the package isn't found.\n- No external network calls, data leaks, or untrusted data flows are present.\n- The package name is a static string or a controlled parameter; no user input or external data source is involved that could be exploited.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n1. **Malware score (all reports):**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n2. **Obfuscated score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n\n3. **Security risk score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code is a benign utility with no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   - The reports do not identify any flaws or risky behaviors.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a simple, safe utility function.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the reports and analysis, the code is benign and safe for use. The scores reflect this accurately.",
