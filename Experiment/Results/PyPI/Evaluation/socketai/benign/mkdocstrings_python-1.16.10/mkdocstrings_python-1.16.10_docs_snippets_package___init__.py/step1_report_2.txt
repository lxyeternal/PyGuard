  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the specified Python package 'mkdocstrings-python'.",
  "sources": "The function call to 'metadata.version(dist)' which reads package metadata to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'dist' is used in 'metadata.version(dist)', which is a controlled API call; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The use of 'importlib.metadata' is standard for Python package metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to get the version of a specified package. It uses 'importlib.metadata' to safely access package info. The try-except handles missing package scenarios gracefully, returning a default version. No hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility to retrieve package version information with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
