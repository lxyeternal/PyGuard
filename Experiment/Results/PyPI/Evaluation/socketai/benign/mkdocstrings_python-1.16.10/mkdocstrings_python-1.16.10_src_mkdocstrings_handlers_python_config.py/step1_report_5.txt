{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated import alias for the `config` module within `mkdocstrings_handlers.python`, issuing a warning to users to update their import statements.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only accesses the imported `config` module internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, code execution, or other security effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only issues a warning and returns an attribute from an imported module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The use of a deprecated import pattern with a warning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a `__getattr__` function to handle attribute access on the module, issuing a deprecation warning when an attribute is accessed, and then returning the attribute from an internal config module. No user input is processed, and no malicious actions are present. The purpose is solely to guide users toward updated import practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a deprecation helper for import statements. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks.",
