{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated alias for importing configuration attributes from a submodule within the mkdocstrings_handlers.python package, encouraging users to import directly from the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'config' object imported from 'mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output untrusted data; the only potential sink is the dynamic attribute access via 'getattr(config, name)'.",
  "flows": "When an attribute is accessed, the code issues a deprecation warning and retrieves the attribute from 'config', creating a source-to-sink flow via 'getattr'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, obfuscated logic, or hidden mechanisms. The code performs standard dynamic attribute access with a deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning when an attribute is accessed, advising users to change import sources. It then uses 'getattr' to retrieve the attribute from 'config'. The warning indicates awareness of deprecated usage but does not execute any harmful or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic, and relies on standard library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deprecation wrapper designed to guide users toward updated import practices. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is not obfuscated.",
