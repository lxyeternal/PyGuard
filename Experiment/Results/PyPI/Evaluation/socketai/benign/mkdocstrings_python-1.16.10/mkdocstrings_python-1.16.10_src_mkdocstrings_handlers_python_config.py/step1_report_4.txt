{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated import alias for accessing configuration attributes from `mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal.config`, guiding users to update their import paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads the attribute `name` from any attribute access on the module, and imports `config` from a submodule.",
  "sinks": "The `getattr(config, name)` potentially exposes attributes from the `config` module, but there are no external inputs or untrusted data sources directly involved.",
  "flows": "When an attribute is accessed, the code issues a warning and retrieves the attribute from the `config` module, which is safe as it is internal.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning to inform about the change in import path, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level `__getattr__` function, which intercepts attribute access on the module itself. It issues a deprecation warning to inform users to change their import statements. The function then retrieves the requested attribute from an internal `config` module. There are no external data inputs, no code execution of untrusted data, and no obfuscated code or malicious patterns present. The code is straightforward, focusing on deprecation handling and forwarding attribute access.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module designed to guide users away from deprecated import paths. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
