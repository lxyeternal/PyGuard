{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated attribute access mechanism that issues a warning and forwards attribute retrieval from an internal config object to maintain backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattr__ triggering getattr(config, name)",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of attributes from the internal config object, potential if attribute names are untrusted",
  "flows": "External attribute access -> __getattr__ -> warnings.warn() + getattr(config, name)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard deprecation pattern using __getattr__ to intercept attribute access, issue a warning, and retrieve the attribute from an internal module. It does not process external data beyond attribute names, which are controlled internally or by trusted code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The pattern is common and safe, with minimal security risk primarily related to potential misuse of dynamic attribute access if external code supplies malicious attribute names, but this is unlikely in typical usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward deprecation helper with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the minimal risk associated with dynamic attribute access. No modifications are necessary.",
