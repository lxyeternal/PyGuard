{
  "purpose": "Provide a deprecated alias to access configuration attributes from an internal module, issuing a warning when accessed.",
  "sources": "The `__getattr__` function accesses the `config` object imported from `mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal`.",
  "sinks": "The `getattr(config, name)` could be considered a sink if untrusted attribute names are supplied externally, potentially leading to unexpected attribute access.",
  "flows": "External code accesses undefined attributes on this module, which triggers `__getattr__`, issuing a warning and retrieving the attribute from `config`.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, implementing a deprecation warning mechanism. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a `__getattr__` method to handle attribute access on the module. When an attribute is accessed that isn't defined, it issues a deprecation warning advising to import directly from `mkdocstrings_handlers.python`. It then retrieves the attribute from the internal `config` object. This pattern is common for deprecating old import paths. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on standard library features and a straightforward attribute access pattern. No external data flows seem to be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign deprecation wrapper that issues warnings and forwards attribute access. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply guides developers toward updated import paths with a warning.",
