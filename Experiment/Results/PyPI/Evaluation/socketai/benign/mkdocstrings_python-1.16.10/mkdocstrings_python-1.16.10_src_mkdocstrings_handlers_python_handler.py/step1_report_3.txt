{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated import mechanism for the `handler` module within `mkdocstrings_handlers.python`, issuing a warning to guide users to update their imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `handler` object from the internal module `mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal` when an attribute is accessed.",
  "sinks": "The `getattr(handler, name)` could potentially access any attribute of the `handler` module, which might be malicious if `handler` contains malicious code or attributes, but this depends on the external module content.",
  "flows": "When an attribute is accessed on this module, it triggers `__getattr__`, which then retrieves the attribute from the imported `handler`, effectively passing untrusted attribute names to the internal module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only provides a warning on deprecated import. No suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of `__getattr__` for delegation is standard for deprecation wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module internally and overrides `__getattr__` to issue a deprecation warning and delegate attribute access to the `handler` object. The warning informs users about the deprecation, guiding future code updates. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The only point of concern would be if `handler` itself contained malicious code, but this is external to this snippet. The pattern is typical for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation wrapper without malicious intent. It simply warns users about deprecated imports and delegates attribute access to an internal module. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this snippet.",
