{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated import pathway for the mkdocstrings_handlers.python.handler module, issuing a warning when accessed and redirecting attribute access to the new module location.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports internal modules and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; no data leaks or effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code; it simply redirects attribute access from a deprecated path to the correct module.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning mechanism, which is common; no suspicious or malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a special __getattr__ function to handle attribute access on the module, issuing a deprecation warning and redirecting to the correct handler. This pattern is typical for managing deprecated imports. No external input, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic present. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a transitional or backward compatibility feature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a deprecation aid with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply warns users about deprecated usage and redirects attribute access appropriately.",
