{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated import interface for mkdocstrings_handlers.python.handler, issuing a warning and delegating attribute access to maintain backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via __getattr__, which fetches attributes from the internal 'handler' module.",
  "sinks": "The getattr(handler, name) call, which accesses attributes of the handler module; potential if handler contains malicious attributes, but external to this code.",
  "flows": "Access to any attribute triggers __getattr__, which issues a warning and retrieves the attribute from handler.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for deprecation handling. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward deprecation wrapper that issues a warning upon attribute access and delegates to an internal module. No external input, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The pattern is common and safe. The only external concern is the content of 'handler', but this is outside the scope of this snippet. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
