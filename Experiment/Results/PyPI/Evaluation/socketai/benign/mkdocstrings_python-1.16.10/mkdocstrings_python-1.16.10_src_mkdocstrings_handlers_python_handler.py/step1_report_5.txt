{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated import mechanism for the `handler` module from `mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal`, issuing a warning when accessed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `name` parameter in the `__getattr__` function and imports the `handler` module from `mkdocstrings_handlers.python._internal`.",
  "sinks": "The `getattr(handler, name)` could potentially access any attribute of the `handler` module, but there is no direct untrusted data sink involving external sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves intercepting attribute access via `__getattr__`, issuing a warning, and returning an attribute from the `handler` module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is simple and straightforward, with no unusual constructs. The only notable point is the use of `__getattr__` for dynamic attribute access, but this is a common pattern for deprecated module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning when attributes are accessed via the module. It imports `handler` from an internal package and dynamically returns attributes from it. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated code. The purpose is to inform users about deprecated import paths. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard deprecation wrapper that issues a warning to guide users to update import paths. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
