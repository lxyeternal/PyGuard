{
  "purpose": "This module provides a deprecated import interface for `mkdocstrings_handlers.python.handler`, issuing a warning when used and redirecting attribute access to the internal handler module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports a module and defines a function for attribute access.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely manages attribute access with a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a `__getattr__` function to redirect attribute access with a deprecation warning. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The comment about removing a file is unrelated to the code functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dynamic attribute accessor `__getattr__` that issues a deprecation warning whenever an attribute is accessed from this module, then retrieves the attribute from the internal handler module. There are no external data inputs, no potential injection points, and no malicious code behaviors. The purpose is purely to inform users about deprecated usage and redirect attribute access. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple deprecation wrapper for an internal module, providing warnings and redirecting attribute access. It poses no security threats or malicious behaviors.",
