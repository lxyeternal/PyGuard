{
  "purpose": "This module provides a deprecated import mechanism that issues a warning and forwards attribute access to an internal handler module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it primarily imports modules and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output is present; it only accesses internal module attributes.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses __getattr__ to forward attribute access, which is typical for deprecation handling; no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a transitional wrapper, warning users about deprecated import paths and redirecting attribute access to an internal handler module. It imports 'warnings' and 'Any' from 'typing', then imports 'handler' from an internal module. The __getattr__ function dynamically fetches attributes from 'handler' when accessed, issuing a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The purpose appears solely to aid in backward compatibility during module refactoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply forwards attribute access from a deprecated import path to the correct module with a warning. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
