  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured configuration module with a known potential for ReDoS attacks via regex patterns if input is maliciously crafted. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious backdoors. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. To improve security, input validation or regex pattern sanitization should be considered, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious intent."
