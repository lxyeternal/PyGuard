  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Focuses on formatting, templating, cross-references, and backlink tree building.\n- Uses subprocess calls for code formatting (Black, Ruff).\n- Regex for cross-reference substitution.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.\n- High confidence (0.95), malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The external subprocess calls are standard for code formatting; inputs are local code snippets, so unlikely to be exploited.\n- Regex replacements are straightforward and safe.\n- Template loading is controlled; fallback logic is safe.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to subprocess calls but controlled)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores seem reasonable and consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1: formatting, cross-references, backlinks.\n- External subprocesses (Black, Ruff) used.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- High confidence (0.9), malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning as Report 1 applies.\n- External formatters are standard; inputs are code snippets.\n- Regex and template logic are safe.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (standard formatting tools, no malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Similar scope: rendering utilities, external formatters, regex, templates.\n- Calls Ruff and Black via subprocess.\n- Uses regex for cross-references.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- External subprocess calls are typical; inputs are code snippets.\n- Regex replacements are safe.\n- No suspicious network activity or hidden code.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Similar functions: formatting, filtering, backlinks.\n- Uses subprocesses for Ruff and Black.\n- Regex replacements, template rendering.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- External tools are standard.\n- Regex and template logic are safe.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Similar scope: rendering, cross-references, backlinks.\n- External subprocess calls for Ruff and Black.\n- Regex for cross-reference substitution.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning as above.\n- Inputs to subprocesses are code snippets.\n- Regex replacements are safe.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior or code is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports is appropriate, given external subprocess calls and regex replacements, which are standard but should be used carefully if inputs are untrusted.\n\n## Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n## My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard external calls and regex, minimal risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
