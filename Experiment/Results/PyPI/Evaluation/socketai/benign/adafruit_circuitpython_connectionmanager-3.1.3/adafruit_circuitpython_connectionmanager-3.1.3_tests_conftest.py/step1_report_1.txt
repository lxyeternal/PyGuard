{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up test fixtures for socket pool modules, mocking external modules, and managing global states for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, function arguments, sys, monkeypatch.setattr",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data handling or insecure operations; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "sys.modules assignments and removals, mock module creation, monkeypatching global variables",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; code appears to be standard test setup with mock modules",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes for socket pools and creates pytest fixtures to inject these mocks into sys.modules for testing. It also resets global state variables using monkeypatch. No untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code strictly appears to facilitate testing of socket pool modules without any malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup for socket pool modules with mock objects and global state resets. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
