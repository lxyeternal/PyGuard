  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures to create mock modules and classes for socket pools used in Adafruit's CircuitPython ecosystem, manipulating sys.modules and resetting global variables for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Dynamic creation of mock modules and classes, sys.modules manipulation, global variable patching in adafruit_connection_manager",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "Creation and injection of mock modules into sys.modules; resetting global variables via monkeypatch",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module creation and sys.modules manipulation, which could be risky outside testing contexts, but in this code, it is confined to test setup",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test scaffolding that creates mock modules and classes for socket pools, injects them into sys.modules, and resets global state variables. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or handle untrusted input. The use of dynamic module creation and sys.modules manipulation is standard in testing environments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate isolated testing of socket pool interactions in a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and should be maintained.",
