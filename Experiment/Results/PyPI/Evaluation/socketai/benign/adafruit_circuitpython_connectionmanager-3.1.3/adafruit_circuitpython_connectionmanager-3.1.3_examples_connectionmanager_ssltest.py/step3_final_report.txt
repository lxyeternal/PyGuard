{
  "purpose": "The code performs network connectivity and SSL/TLS validation tests against a list of known hosts, including insecure and problematic SSL sites, to assess SSL configurations and host reachability. It is intended as a diagnostic or security testing tool.",
  "sources": "Reads Wi-Fi credentials from environment variables; establishes Wi-Fi connection; attempts SSL connections to specified hosts and ports.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections for SSL handshakes; no data exfiltration or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Source: Wi-Fi credentials and host list -> Connection attempts via sockets -> SSL handshake and validation -> Logging results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets beyond environment variables; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward network diagnostic tool that tests SSL configurations on a predefined list of hosts, including insecure sites for testing purposes. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The environment variables for Wi-Fi credentials are standard practice but should be handled securely. The code's purpose is diagnostic, not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The exception handling and connection logic are standard. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSL and network connectivity testing script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
