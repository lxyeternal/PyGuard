  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying singleton behavior and differentiation of connection managers in the adafruit_connection_manager module using mock objects.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'mocket' and 'adafruit_connection_manager', function calls to get_connection_manager and get_radio_socketpool.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code performs internal assertions only.",
  "flows": "Calls to get_connection_manager and get_radio_socketpool serve as sources; assertions compare object identities as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that uses mock objects to verify singleton behavior and differentiation of connection managers based on socket pools. It contains no data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign with high confidence. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
