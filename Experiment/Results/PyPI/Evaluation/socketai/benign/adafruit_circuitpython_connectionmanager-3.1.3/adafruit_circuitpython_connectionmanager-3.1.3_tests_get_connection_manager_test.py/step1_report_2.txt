{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the adafruit_connection_manager module, specifically testing connection manager singleton behavior and different socket pools.",
  "sources": "Imports of mocket, adafruit_connection_manager, and functions within the test to create mock objects and retrieve connection managers.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing connection manager instances; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Mock objects (radio and socket pools) are created and passed into adafruit_connection_manager functions to retrieve connection managers; comparison assertions check for expected singleton or distinct instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears standard for unit testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing and mocking libraries, creates mock radio and socket pool objects, and tests singleton behavior of connection managers. It performs assertions to verify that identical pools return the same connection manager instance, and different pools return different instances. No code injection, external data handling, or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical unit tests on the adafruit_connection_manager module without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe, focusing solely on verifying expected object behavior.",
