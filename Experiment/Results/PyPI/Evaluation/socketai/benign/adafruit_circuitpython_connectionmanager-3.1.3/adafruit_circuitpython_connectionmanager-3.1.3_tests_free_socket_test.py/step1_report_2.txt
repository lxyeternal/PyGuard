{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the adafruit_connection_manager module to verify socket management behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports 'mocket' for mock socket creation, 'pytest' for testing framework, and 'adafruit_connection_manager' for socket management logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; tests are for internal socket management functions only.",
  "flows": "The tests create mock sockets, manage them via ConnectionManager, and verify internal state changes without external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard mock objects and testing patterns without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of unit tests that validate the behavior of socket tracking within the adafruit_connection_manager. It uses mock sockets from the 'mocket' library to simulate socket creation and management, with assertions ensuring correct internal state updates. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no network communication beyond mocks, and no suspicious code patterns. The use of 'pytest' and 'mocket' aligns with standard testing practices. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Overall, this appears to be legitimate testing code for socket management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for socket management with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The purpose is to verify correct behavior of the ConnectionManager class.",
