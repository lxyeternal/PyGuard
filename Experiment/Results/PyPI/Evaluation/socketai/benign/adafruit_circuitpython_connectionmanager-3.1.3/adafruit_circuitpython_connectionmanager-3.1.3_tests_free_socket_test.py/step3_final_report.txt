  "purpose": "Unit tests for adafruit_connection_manager's socket management, verifying socket tracking, freeing, and error handling using mocks.",
  "sources": "Mock socket pool and mock socket objects created via mocket library",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data flow; internal state checks only",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke get_socket and free_socket methods, affecting internal socket tracking structures",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward test logic with no suspicious or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for testing socket management with mock objects, involving no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It interacts only with controlled mocks, asserting internal state changes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The malware score is justified at 0, and the security risk is minimal, consistent with benign test code. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward, controlled nature of the tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard testing code for socket management, correctly scored with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
