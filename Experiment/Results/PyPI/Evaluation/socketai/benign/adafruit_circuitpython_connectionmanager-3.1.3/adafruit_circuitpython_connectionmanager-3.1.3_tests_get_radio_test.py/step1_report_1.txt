{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for adafruit_connection_manager module, specifically testing socket pool and SSL context functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include mock radio objects, sys.implementation patch, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke adafruit_connection_manager functions with mock objects, primarily to verify object types and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Use of mock patches and dummy objects is typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a suite of unit tests designed to verify the behavior of socket pool and SSL context retrieval functions in various radio object scenarios. Uses mock objects to simulate hardware classes and patches system properties to test different code paths. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with assertions confirming correct types and error raising for unsupported classes. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for connection management functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely tests function outputs and error handling with controlled mocks. No harmful or sabotage code detected.",
