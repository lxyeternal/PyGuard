{
  "purpose": "The code establishes a Wi-Fi connection, performs HTTP GET requests to a test URL, and manages network sockets.",
  "sources": "Reads Wi-Fi SSID and password from environment variables; reads URL from a constant.",
  "sinks": "Uses adafruit_requests to make HTTP requests, which could potentially be exploited if URL or data is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Wi-Fi connection -> HTTP request via adafruit_requests -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; uses environment variables securely. The URL is a fixed string, which is expected for test code.",
  "analysis": "The script connects to Wi-Fi using credentials from environment variables, then performs HTTP GET requests to a predefined test URL. It manages socket connections explicitly and prints socket status. The code does not perform any data processing beyond printing the response. It does not contain suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No untrusted input is used that could lead to injection or security issues. The usage appears standard for a network connectivity test and management script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward network connectivity test script that securely manages Wi-Fi credentials via environment variables and performs HTTP requests without suspicious or malicious behavior. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
