{
  "purpose": "The code performs protocol tests for the adafruit_connection_manager module, focusing on connection behavior for HTTPS and HTTP protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports mocket, pytest, and adafruit_connection_manager; reads mock host and port information during test execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input leading to data leaks or malicious effects are present; tests only invoke methods on mock objects.",
  "flows": "Test functions create mock socket connections and verify connection parameters and SSL wrapping behavior based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. Usage of mock objects for testing is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up mock network connections to verify that the connection manager correctly handles HTTPS and HTTP protocols, including SSL wrapping and port selection. No untrusted data flows, no code injection, or malicious behaviors are detected. The tests are straightforward unit tests for connection logic, using standard mocking practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing suite for network connection handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs mock objects appropriately and does not contain malicious or suspicious code.",
