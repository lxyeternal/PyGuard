{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for the adafruit_connection_manager module, verifying socket connection behaviors over HTTP and HTTPS using mock objects.",
  "sources": "Mock socket pool and socket objects, mock SSL context, predefined hostnames and ports",
  "sinks": "Connection attempts via socket.connect, SSL wrap_socket calls",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke get_socket with mock host/port, leading to socket.connect and wrap_socket calls",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock hostnames and ports, but within a controlled testing environment; no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing code that uses mocks to verify connection logic. No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The tests check for correct port assignment and SSL wrapping, with no untrusted data processing beyond test inputs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to the use of mock hostnames and ports, which is acceptable in a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured test code with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor risk scores reflect the use of mock data but do not indicate real security concerns.",
