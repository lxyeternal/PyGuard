  "purpose": "Unit tests for the adafruit_connection_manager module, specifically testing socket connections over HTTP and HTTPS.",
  "sources": "import statements, mock objects, and test functions that simulate network connections.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code interacts with mock objects for testing network behavior.",
  "flows": "Test functions create mock socket objects, then invoke get_socket to simulate network connection scenarios, checking for proper handling of SSL contexts and ports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard testing practices with mocks, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that use mock objects to simulate network socket behavior. It verifies that the connection manager handles HTTPS and HTTP connections correctly, including SSL context handling and port assignments. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and employs common testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for network connection handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
