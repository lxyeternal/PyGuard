{
  "purpose": "Provide mock classes and data for testing socket, network, and SSL interactions in a controlled environment, primarily for unit testing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining mock IP addresses, hostnames, and response data; class constructors and methods that set up mock objects and responses.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process untrusted input nor send data to external systems; it only creates mock objects.",
  "flows": "N/A; code only creates mock objects and data, with no actual data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code solely defines mocks for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up mock network components and responses to simulate network interactions. It uses predefined data and mock objects from the unittest.mock module. No dynamic or external input is processed, and there are no suspicious operations. The classes are for testing purposes only, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing network-related components with mock objects. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any data leaks or unauthorized actions. The overall security risk is negligible.",
