{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock classes and constants to simulate network socket behavior for testing purposes, without performing real network operations.",
  "sources": "Static data such as MOCK_POOL_IP, MOCK_HOST_1, MOCK_HOST_2, MOCK_PATH_1, and the response bytes; mock object methods simulating socket operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or user input, so no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The mock methods simulate data flow from predefined responses through socket-like interfaces, but no real data flow from untrusted sources occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with static data and mock objects designed solely for testing network interactions. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes for socket pools, sockets, SSL contexts, and radio interfaces, all using static, hardcoded data and mock objects. It does not perform any real network communication, data processing, or contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The purpose is clearly for testing network code in a controlled environment. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent or activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity and simplicity of the code. The security risk score is 0.1 at most, reflecting the static data setup but not representing any real security concern. All scores are consistent with the code's benign, testing-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward mock setup for network testing with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low scores. No improvements are necessary; the code remains safe and suitable for testing environments.",
