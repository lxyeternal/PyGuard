{
  "purpose": "This code defines mock classes and constants to simulate socket, SSL, and network behavior for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Constants and class initializations that do not read external input; mock methods that generate predetermined responses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; mock methods simulate network interactions internally.",
  "flows": "The code primarily creates mock objects with hardcoded responses and behavior, without any external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock objects and hardcoded IP addresses, response data, and no real network interaction. No apparent malicious code, backdoors, or secret behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for simulating network sockets and SSL connections for testing purposes. It does not process external inputs or produce side effects beyond the mock environment. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be purely for testing and does not contain any malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of mock classes designed for testing network interactions. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is intended solely for simulation purposes.",
