{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock classes and data to simulate network socket and SSL behaviors, likely for testing purposes in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Code reads static mock data for network responses, mock socket methods, and mock configurations; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data outside its mock context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined mock responses through socket-like methods, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward mock implementation intended for testing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes and constants for simulating network interactions and SSL wrapping, with no active network operations or data processing. The classes are purely for testing and contain no malicious or obfuscated logic. There are no code injection points, no sensitive data handling, and no external dependencies or inputs that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears safe, structured, and intentionally simplified for test scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of mock classes and data used for testing network interactions, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks and functions solely as a testing utility.",
