  "purpose": "Provide mock classes and constants for simulating socket and network behavior in testing environments.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines classes and constants for testing purposes, without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only creates mock objects for testing, with no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard for mock testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes (MocketPool, Mocket, SSLContext) that simulate socket and SSL operations for testing network interactions. It uses hardcoded IP addresses, hostnames, and response data, which are typical for mock setups. There are no dynamic code executions, external data dependencies, or suspicious patterns. The code serves purely as a testing stub with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard mock setup for testing network communication in Python. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
