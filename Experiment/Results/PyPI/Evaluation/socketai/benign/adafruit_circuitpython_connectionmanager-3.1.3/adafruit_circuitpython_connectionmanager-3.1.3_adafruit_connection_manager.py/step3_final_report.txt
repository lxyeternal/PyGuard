  "purpose": "A socket and SSL/TLS connection management library designed for multiple hardware platforms, providing fallback mechanisms for environments lacking native SSL support.",
  "sources": "System modules, hardware interface attributes, socket creation functions, SSL context wrappers, and fallback fake SSL classes.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, SSL wrapping, socket closing, and data transfer functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, protocol) to socket creation, optional SSL wrapping, connection, and reuse or closure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback '_FakeSSLSocket' and '_FakeSSLContext' classes to emulate SSL in environments without native support; these are benign compatibility features.",
  "analysis": "The code manages sockets and SSL contexts with platform-specific fallbacks, avoiding hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The fallback mechanisms are standard for embedded hardware, ensuring compatibility rather than malicious intent. The security practices are sound, with proper resource management and error handling. The malware score is correctly zero, obfuscation is absent, and the low security risk reflects the utility nature of the code and its fallback features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured network connection manager with appropriate fallback mechanisms for hardware limitations. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
