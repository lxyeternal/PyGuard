  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a legitimate connection manager with fallback SSL support, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It emphasizes the use of fake SSL contexts for environments lacking SSL, which is standard in embedded systems.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores malware at 0 and obfuscated at 0. This aligns with the code, which is transparent and standard.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but still low, considering the code manages sockets and SSL contexts properly.\n\n- **Justification:** No issues found; the code is consistent with the description. The fallback mechanisms are benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a legitimate socket and SSL management library, with fallback support, no suspicious patterns, and standard practices.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, matching the code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's scoring and conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard socket/SSL manager, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both zero, consistent with the code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, considering socket management.\n\n- **Justification:** The fallback to fake SSL contexts is benign, intended for hardware limitations.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a legitimate network manager, with no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both zero, consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard socket/SSL management library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero, matching the code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The scores are all at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All are at 0, matching the transparent nature of the code.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risks in socket management but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Code behavior:** The code manages sockets and SSL contexts properly, with fallback mechanisms for hardware lacking SSL support. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at approximately:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk scores are justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent across reports)  \n\nNo further action needed.",
