  "purpose": "Provides scope management, variable, function, mixin, and import handling for Sass in Python.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures, function introspection via inspect, source path attributes.",
  "sinks": "Internal modifications, registration of functions, import source tracking.",
  "flows": "Variable names normalized; functions registered through introspection; import sources tracked via source.path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect for function signature analysis; reliance on external source objects with 'path' attribute; no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard scope and namespace management for a Sass compiler, using Python data structures and introspection. No external network or file I/O occurs beyond source path tracking. The dynamic registration of functions and import handling are typical patterns in plugin systems. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main potential security concern is the registration of external functions which could be malicious if supplied from untrusted sources, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of scope management for a Sass compiler in Python. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential misuse if external functions are maliciously supplied, but the code itself is benign.",
