  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of docstrings, comments, import statements, and constant definitions for versioning, author info, URLs, and licensing. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no code that could be exploited or used maliciously. It appears to be purely informational and metadata setup. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata and documentation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks present.",
