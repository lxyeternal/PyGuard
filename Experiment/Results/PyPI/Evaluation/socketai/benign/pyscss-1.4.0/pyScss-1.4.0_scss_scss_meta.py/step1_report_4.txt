  "purpose": "Provide metadata and documentation for the pyScss library, including versioning, author, licensing, and project information.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments, import statements, and module metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata definitions, string literals, version information, and comments. It imports 'sys' but does not use it elsewhere in the fragment. There are no inputs, network activity, or executable logic that could be malicious. The code appears to serve as module documentation and versioning info, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module header containing metadata and documentation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
