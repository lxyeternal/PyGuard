  "purpose": "Define metadata and version information for the pyScss library, a SCSS compiler for Python.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version, date, author, URLs, and license information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted or external input leading to potential security impact.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code consists solely of static metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines version and build metadata, author info, URLs, and license. No input/output operations, network communication, or data processing is present. All variables are statically assigned constant values, with no dynamic or user-controlled data. The code appears to be purely informational, serving as metadata for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata definition block with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no sensitive operations or external interactions. The code is safe and intended solely for package metadata.",
