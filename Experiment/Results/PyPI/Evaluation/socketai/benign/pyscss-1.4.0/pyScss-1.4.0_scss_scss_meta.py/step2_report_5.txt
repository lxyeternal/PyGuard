  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is static, contains only metadata, and involves no dynamic or external operations.\n- The code only imports `__future__` for compatibility, defines constants for version, author, URLs, and license info.\n- No data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely informational, serving as package metadata.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The import of `sys` is unused, but this is common in such files and does not pose a security concern.\n- The use of `from __future__ import unicode_literals` is for compatibility and is standard practice.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- Security risk score: 0 is appropriate, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, static, and solely metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final personal estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe, and non-malicious metadata module for the pyScss project. All scores and assessments are justified and accurate.",
