  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, ensuring consistency and thoroughness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static metadata, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code is simple, mainly defining constants and importing __future__ for compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets do **not** contain any malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources or sinks.\n- The code is purely static metadata.\n\n### Issues identified:\n- The reports are consistent: all conclude benign, metadata-only code.\n- No discrepancies or errors in reasoning are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since all reports agree on the benign, static nature, the risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- Malware score is correctly set to 0; there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated is correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module metadata setup with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
