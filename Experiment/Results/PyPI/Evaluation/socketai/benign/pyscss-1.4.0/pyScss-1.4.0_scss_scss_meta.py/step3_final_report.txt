{
  "purpose": "Static package metadata including version, author, URLs, and license information for pyScss.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, import statements, and comments; no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of sys; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, static, and contains only metadata constants and comments. It imports sys but does not use it, which is harmless. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as package metadata. All security signals indicate benign intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
