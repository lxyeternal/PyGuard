  "purpose": "Define metadata and descriptive information about the pyScss library, including version, author, URLs, and licensing details.",
  "sources": "Constants and string manipulations for versioning, author info, URLs, and license data.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only sets variables and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes static metadata for the package, including version info, author details, URLs, and license. No data input, no data output, no external calls, and no dynamic execution. This is typical for a module's metadata setup and contains no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign module that defines package metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns. It only contains static information with no signs of malicious behavior.",
