{
  "purpose": "This code handles source files for a CSS/SCSS compiler, including reading, encoding detection, source processing, and preparing code for compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads source files from filesystem via open/read methods, and from strings via from_string method.",
  "sinks": "Processes source code for parsing, transformations, and substitutions within prepare_source method; potential for data manipulation or injection if untrusted data is introduced.",
  "flows": "Source data (files or strings) flows through constructors and read methods into internal representation; then through prepare_source which performs regex-based transformations and comment removal; output is processed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The regex substitutions and string manipulations are standard for source preprocessing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard source file handling, encoding detection, and source code preprocessing for CSS/SCSS compilation. It includes mechanisms to read files, handle encodings, and process source code to remove comments and protect string literals. No suspicious network activities, reverse shells, or malicious data leaks are present. The regex-based transformations are typical for comment removal and string protections, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. The source-to-sink flow is limited to source reading and code preprocessing, with no external network or system manipulation. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused on source handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical source handler and preprocessor for a CSS/SCSS compiler, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
