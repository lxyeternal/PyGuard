{
  "purpose": "The code defines a SourceFile class for reading, encoding detection, and preprocessing of CSS/SASS/SCSS source files, including comment removal and string handling.",
  "sources": "File reading from disk or string inputs, regex-based comment removal, string escaping, whitespace normalization.",
  "sinks": "Regex operations on source code, no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source input (file or string) -> regex sanitization and processing -> cleaned source code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code; standard regex for comment removal and string handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard source file handling with regex-based sanitization. No network, code injection, or obfuscation patterns are present. The regex manipulations are typical for CSS/SASS preprocessing. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk source file handler for CSS/SASS preprocessing. It contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score.",
