{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for reading, handling, and processing CSS/SASS source files, including encoding detection, source file representation, and line parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads source code contents from file-like objects, files on disk via paths, or directly from strings. Uses functions like 'read', 'from_file', 'from_path', and 'from_string' to acquire source code data.",
  "sinks": "Processes source code to remove comments, handle string literals, and collapse spaces. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code primarily manipulates text data internally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from file reading or string input through 'prepare_source', which parses lines, removes comments, and encodes transformations, then stored or further processed internally. No network or external data transmission is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities detected. The code performs standard file handling, encoding detection, and text processing typical for CSS/SASS compilers. No obfuscation or unusual dynamic code execution patterns are present. Use of regular expressions for comment removal and string handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SourceFile class for representing and processing source files, with methods to read from disk, handle encodings, and parse CSS/SASS lines. It uses regex for comment removal and string literal protection. No functions or code segments perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for CSS/SASS preprocessing with no malicious indicators. The only potential concern might be if the regex patterns or string substitutions are manipulated externally, but within this context, they serve standard purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate utility for CSS/SASS source file handling and preprocessing. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It operates purely on text data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
