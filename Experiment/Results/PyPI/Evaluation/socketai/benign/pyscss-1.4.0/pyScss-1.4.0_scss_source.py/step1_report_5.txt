{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for handling and processing source files (particularly CSS/SCSS/SASS files), including reading, encoding detection, source parsing, and cleaning operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads source data from file objects, file paths, or strings, particularly during initialization or class methods like from_file, from_path, from_string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present that process untrusted input into security-sensitive operations. There are no network, database, or system command calls, nor data leaks, command injections, or credential handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source inputs (files or strings) through parsing and cleaning functions, with transformations such as comment removal, string escaping, and whitespace collapsing. No untrusted data is used in dangerous system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes no unusual or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The comment and string processing are standard for source code handling.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured parser and preprocessor for CSS/SCSS/SASS source files, handling encoding detection, source identification, and cleaning. It includes methods for reading files, detecting encoding, and processing lines to support SCSS/SASS syntax. No evidence of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code was found. The operations are limited to file handling, string processing, and comment removal, all of which are typical for a source code processor. The security risk is minimal, with no suspicious operations or data leaks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard source file handler and preprocessor with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malicious payloads or backdoors and appears to serve a legitimate purpose in source code processing pipelines.",
