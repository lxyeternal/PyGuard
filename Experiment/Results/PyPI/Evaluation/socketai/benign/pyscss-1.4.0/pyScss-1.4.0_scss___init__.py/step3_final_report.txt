  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization module for the pyScss package, importing metadata, setting module variables, configuring logging, and re-exporting core classes for use in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Metadata imports from scss.scss_meta, standard module imports, and logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and purely for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing metadata, setting module variables, configuring logging, and re-exporting core components. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All imported modules are standard and metadata is static. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
