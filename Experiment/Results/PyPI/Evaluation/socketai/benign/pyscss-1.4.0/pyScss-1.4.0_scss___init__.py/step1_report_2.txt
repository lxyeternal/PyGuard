  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows through importing modules and setting up metadata without data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are observed. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization script with metadata setup, import statements, and export definitions. It does not contain any executable code that interacts with external data, performs system modifications, or includes potentially malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
