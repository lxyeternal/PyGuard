  "purpose": "Define metadata and re-export modules for the pyScss library, a Python-based Sass/Scss compiler.",
  "sources": "Import statements, metadata definitions, and module re-exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; module imports and attribute assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code consists of standard module initialization and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains metadata definitions, import statements, and documentation comments. It re-exports components from internal modules, which is common practice for library packages. There are no input/output functions, network operations, or code execution that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets or credential information are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard open-source library setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, benign Python package initialization file for pyScss. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
