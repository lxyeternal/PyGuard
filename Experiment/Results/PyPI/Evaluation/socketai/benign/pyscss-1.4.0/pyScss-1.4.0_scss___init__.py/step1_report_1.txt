{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and initialization script for a Python package that compiles SCSS into CSS, providing metadata and re-exporting core components.",
  "sources": "Imports from scss.scss_meta, scss.compiler, and scss.legacy modules; module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily imports, sets metadata, and exposes components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and maintains standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system future features for compatibility, loads metadata from a local module, sets package metadata variables, initializes a logger, and re-exports core classes. All code appears to be standard package setup without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No network activity, data handling, or external data processing is present. The code does not execute untrusted input or contain obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script providing metadata and re-exports. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
