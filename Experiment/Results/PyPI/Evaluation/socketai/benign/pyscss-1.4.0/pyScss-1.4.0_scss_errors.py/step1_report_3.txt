{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling errors related to Sass processing, including error formatting and tracking import rules.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from exception objects and internal method calls; no external data input is explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Error messages are formatted for display or logging, but there are no sinks that send data to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; error handling is internal and formatting-related.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, no network operations, or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Sass error handling, including formatting methods for error display and traceback generation. It uses standard Python modules such as sys and traceback for exception context. The functions and classes are straightforward, focusing on error management and presentation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign error handling framework for Sass processing. It does not contain any malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious behavior. It is purely for internal error reporting and formatting.",
