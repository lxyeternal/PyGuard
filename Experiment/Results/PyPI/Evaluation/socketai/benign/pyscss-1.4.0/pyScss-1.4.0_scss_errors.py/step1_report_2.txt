{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes and helper functions for error handling and reporting within a Sass processing library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code mainly uses internal variables and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential output points include the 'to_css' method which formats error messages into CSS for browser display.",
  "flows": "Error objects generate formatted messages that are embedded into CSS strings for browser display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious external connections, data leaks, or obfuscated code. Usage of string replacements for CSS escaping is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides structured error handling with custom exceptions for a Sass compiler, including methods for formatting error messages and traceback information. No external input reading or network activity occurs. The 'to_css' method sanitizes error messages for browser display, which appears to be a standard practice. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured with no signs of obfuscation or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling framework for a Sass compiler. It does not contain malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks. Its purpose is to manage and report errors in a controlled manner. No suspicious or malicious signals are present.",
