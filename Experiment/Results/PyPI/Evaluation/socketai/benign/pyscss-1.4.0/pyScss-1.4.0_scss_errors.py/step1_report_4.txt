{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling and reporting in a Sass compiler, including error formatting for displaying in browsers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; internal data such as input strings, positions, and rule objects are used for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data to external systems; only formats messages for display or logging.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly constructs error messages and traceback information without processing untrusted input into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden malicious actions are present. The CSS template for error display is straightforward, and no network or file I/O occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of exception classes for handling and formatting Sass compilation errors. It manages error context, including rule stacks and import chains, and prepares error messages for display in browsers. The functions add_error_marker and format_error messages are purely for error reporting. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of imported modules (six, sys, traceback) is standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to be standard error handling code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error classes and formatting utilities for a Sass compiler, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It handles errors gracefully and formats messages for debugging or browser display. The overall security risk is low.",
