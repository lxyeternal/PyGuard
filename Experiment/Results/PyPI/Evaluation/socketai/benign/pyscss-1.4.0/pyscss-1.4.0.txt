      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of exec() to load package metadata, which should be verified for integrity. The overall malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), assuming the metadata file is from a trusted source."

      "conclusion": "The core code is a legitimate, well-structured Sass compiler with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the extension/plugin system, which could be exploited if malicious extensions are introduced. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to extension handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of scope management for a Sass compiler in Python. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential misuse if external functions are maliciously supplied, but the code itself is benign."

It handles error formatting and display, with a slight potential risk if error messages are maliciously crafted. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature, and further sanitization could mitigate the minor risk."
