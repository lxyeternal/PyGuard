{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated interface for compiling SCSS to CSS, handling variable evaluation, source files, and compiler configuration.",
  "sources": "SCSS variable inputs, source files read from disk, user-provided strings or files, configuration options.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations, variable evaluations, compiler invocation, no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input variables evaluated via Calculator, source files loaded into SourceFile objects, data passed to Compiler for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of evaluate_expression on variables is standard but could be risky if untrusted input is evaluated insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured interface for SCSS compilation, involving file reading, variable evaluation, and compiler setup. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of evaluate_expression on variables is typical for SCSS processing, assuming safe implementation. File handling is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern is the evaluation of variables via evaluate_expression, which is standard in such contexts. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
