{
  "purpose": "The code provides a deprecated Python interface for compiling SCSS (Sass) to CSS, managing variables, source files, and compiler configuration.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include scss_vars, scss_files, scss_string, scss_file, and source_files; environment variables or external files are indirectly involved through file reading.",
  "sinks": "File reading occurs when opening scss_file; source data is added via add_source method; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input variables and source files are processed and fed into the Compiler object for compilation; no external data flow paths to network or system modifications are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors, are observed. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard SCSS compilation workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a SCSS compiler with configurable options and variables, reads source files, and compiles SCSS into CSS. It includes file handling, variable evaluation, and setting up compiler options. No code injection, malicious data leaks, or unauthorized system actions are present. All external interactions are limited to file I/O and in-memory processing; there are no network connections or security-critical operations that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of a SCSS compiler interface with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles source data safely through controlled file reads and variable assignments, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
