  "conclusion": "The core code is a legitimate, well-structured Sass compiler with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the extension/plugin system, which could be exploited if malicious extensions are introduced. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to extension handling."
