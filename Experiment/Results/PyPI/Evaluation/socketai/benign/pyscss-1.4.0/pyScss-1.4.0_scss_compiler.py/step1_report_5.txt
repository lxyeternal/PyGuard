  "purpose": "This code implements a Sass compiler, handling parsing, rules management, CSS generation, and Sass-specific directives and features.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from source files, string inputs, and evaluated expressions (e.g., in functions, directives, property assignments). Data is also retrieved from environment variables indirectly through imported modules or evaluation context.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into functions like evaluate_expression, calculate, parse_expression, and evaluate_call_args; outputs include generated CSS, error messages, debug info, and source maps. Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is evaluated without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from source files or input strings is processed through evaluation and parsing functions, which may then influence generated CSS or debug outputs. For example, evaluate_expression and calculate methods influence CSS output; @import directives load external sources; evaluate expressions can influence rule properties and CSS content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses dynamic attribute access and eval-like methods (e.g., evaluate_expression, parse_expression, evaluate), but these are standard for a compiler and do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code relies on external modules for core functionality, which are not included here, but their usage appears typical for a compiler infrastructure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a robust compiler class with methods for parsing, rule management, and CSS generation, with no signs of malicious behavior. There is extensive handling of directives and features typical for Sass, with safety considerations such as error catching and warnings. The evaluation functions are used for property calculations and selector parsing, which are standard. External modules like 'scss' are imported, but their usage is consistent with expected compiler behavior. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration code is present. The code's dynamic features are confined within the context of a compiler, and no suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Sass compiler with no evident malicious intent or sabotage. It processes inputs, evaluates expressions, and outputs CSS in a typical manner. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond standard compiler operations. The overall security risk score is low.",
