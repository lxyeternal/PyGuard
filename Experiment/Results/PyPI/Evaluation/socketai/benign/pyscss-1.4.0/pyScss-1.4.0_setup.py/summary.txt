  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of exec() to load package metadata, which should be verified for integrity. The overall malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), assuming the metadata file is from a trusted source."
