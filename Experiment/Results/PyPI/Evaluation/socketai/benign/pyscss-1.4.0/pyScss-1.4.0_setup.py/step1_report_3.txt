  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure, build, and install a Python package named 'PROJECT', including optional C extensions for performance improvements.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from 'scss/scss_meta.py', configuration files like 'DESCRIPTION', 'README.rst', and package dependencies from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "None directly observed; the script mainly handles setup and compilation processes without executing or transmitting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and configuration files; attempts to compile C extensions; falls back to pure Python setup if compilation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Uses exec() to read metadata, which could potentially be risky if the file contents are malicious, but this is standard for setup scripts. No network communication, code injection, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package that manages dependencies, compiles optional C extensions, and installs package components. It includes a custom build extension class that gracefully handles build failures, printing warnings if compilation fails. It reads package metadata from a separate file and attempts to compile C code for performance enhancements. No obfuscated code or malicious logic such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The use of exec() to load metadata is typical for setup scripts, though it could be slightly risky if the metadata file were malicious; however, this is not unusual or suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup file for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages dependencies, optional C extension compilation, and package installation securely. The use of exec() to load metadata is common but could be slightly risky if the metadata file is compromised. Overall, the code is standard and safe.",
