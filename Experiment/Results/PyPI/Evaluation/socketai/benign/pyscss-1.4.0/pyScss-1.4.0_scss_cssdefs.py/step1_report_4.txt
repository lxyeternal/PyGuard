{
  "purpose": "Define CSS constants, color names, units, functions, and parsing utilities for CSS processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for fractions, math, re, and six; usage of hardcoded color names and unit conversions; regex patterns for parsing CSS and SCSS syntax.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or network communication; no file or system modification code; regex operations and data processing are local.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within data definitions and regex parsing; no external or untrusted data flow to sensitive functions or system components.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse CSS/SCSS syntax; extensive data dictionaries and regex patterns without any obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no apparent malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of CSS constants, color mappings, unit conversions, CSS function validation, and regex-based parsing utilities. There is no network communication, data exfiltration, or command execution. Regex patterns are used for parsing CSS syntax, not for malicious string manipulation. The data dictionaries and functions are standard for CSS processing. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as backdoors, data theft, or hidden activities, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for CSS processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains well-defined constants, regex patterns, and functions for CSS syntax and unit handling, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
