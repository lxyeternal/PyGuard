  "purpose": "Defines CSS constants, color names, regex patterns, unit conversions, and utility functions for CSS parsing and processing.",
  "sources": "CSS constants, regex patterns for parsing, unescape functions, encoding detection logic.",
  "sinks": "Regex and string functions that could be misused with malicious input, but no actual malicious data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings -> regex/unescape functions -> internal data structures; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; regex patterns are standard for CSS parsing, not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard CSS utility constants, regex patterns, and functions for color lookup, unit conversion, encoding detection, and unescaping. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. Regex patterns are used for parsing CSS constructs and are typical for such utilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and content. The code is transparent, well-structured, and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSS utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
