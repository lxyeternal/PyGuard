{
  "purpose": "Defines CSS constants, functions, and utility routines for CSS parsing and unit conversion, likely used in a CSS preprocessor or parser.",
  "sources": "Imports from fractions, math, re, six; static dictionaries and sets defining CSS colors, units, functions, regex patterns; functions operating on these data structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, network, or system calls; functions mainly perform data transformations, lookups, and regex-based parsing.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily involve lookups and conversions within the provided data structures. No untrusted input handling or data output to external systems is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard CSS utility library with parsing and conversion functions. No obfuscated code, or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions for CSS colors, units, and functions, along with helper functions for unit conversion, CSS encoding determination, and regex-based parsing. The functions serve predictable roles such as conversion, lookup, and string unescaping. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or external network activity. The use of regex and data structures aligns with standard CSS parsing practices. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for CSS parsing, color, and unit management. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
