  "purpose": "Define CSS constants, functions, and utilities for parsing and handling CSS, including color names, units, functions, and encoding detection.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, imports, and regular expression patterns used for parsing and processing CSS data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code mainly for parsing and lookup without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard CSS parsing logic. The presence of regex patterns and unescape functions are typical for CSS processing. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides CSS constants, color mappings, unit conversions, and regex-based parsing functions. It performs encoding detection and string unescaping for CSS source processing. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious data handling. The regex patterns are used for CSS syntax parsing, not obfuscation or malware. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CSS utility module intended for parsing and processing CSS content. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate CSS parsing, color lookups, and unit conversions without executing or leaking untrusted data.",
