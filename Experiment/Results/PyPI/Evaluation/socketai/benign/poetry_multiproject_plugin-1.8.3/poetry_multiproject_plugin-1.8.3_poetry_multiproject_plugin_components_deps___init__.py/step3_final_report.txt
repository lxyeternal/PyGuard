  "purpose": "Re-export of the install_deps function from the poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.deps.installer module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing install_deps from a third-party package.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Import from external package to module namespace; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data processing, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports a function from an external package and exposes it via __all__. No suspicious logic, data flows, or anomalies are present. The reliance on an external package is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate a benign nature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0-0.1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The dependency trustworthiness should be verified separately, but the code snippet itself is safe. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
