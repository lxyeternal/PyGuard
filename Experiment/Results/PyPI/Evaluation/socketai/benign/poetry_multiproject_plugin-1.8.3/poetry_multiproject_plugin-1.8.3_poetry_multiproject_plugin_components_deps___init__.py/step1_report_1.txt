{
  "purpose": "The code exports an install_deps function from a specific module, likely used for dependency installation.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'install_deps' from 'poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.deps.installer'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports a function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only an import and an export statement; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export statement. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or contain any suspicious logic. The module imported appears to be part of a plugin related to Poetry (Python package manager), which is common for dependency management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or unsafe.",
