  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a straightforward import and export of `install_deps`.\n- No data flows, no suspicious logic, no anomalies.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, just a different wording.\n- No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Also benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly different in that it notes the dependency is from a third-party package, but still just an import and export.\n- No data flows, anomalies, or suspicious constructs.\n- Confidence is 0.9, indicating some minor uncertainty, possibly due to external dependency trustworthiness.\n- Malware score remains 0, security risk is very low (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** Still benign; reliance on external package warrants verification but does not imply malicious code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import and export, no anomalies.\n- High confidence (1), malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, import from third-party, no suspicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but no actual malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, just a standard module export.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a simple import/export pattern with no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, consistent with benign behavior.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code snippets are trivial and safe.\n- The reliance on external packages (like `poetry_multiproject_plugin`) is noted but does not imply malicious intent; it warrants verification of the package source but not a security issue in the code itself.\n- No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n### My recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.",
