  "purpose": "Expose the 'install_deps' function from a specific module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'install_deps' from a third-party package 'poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.deps.installer'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function and then exposes it via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any operations beyond importing and defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a third-party package and exposes it for use elsewhere. It does not process any data, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The reliance on an external dependency ('poetry_multiproject_plugin') warrants verification of trustworthiness, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard Python module that exposes an imported function. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues in this code snippet.",
