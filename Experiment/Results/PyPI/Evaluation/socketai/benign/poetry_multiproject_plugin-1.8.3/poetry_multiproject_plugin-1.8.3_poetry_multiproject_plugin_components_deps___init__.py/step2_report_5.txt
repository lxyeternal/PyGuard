  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import and export of the `install_deps` function from a specific module.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are detected.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to be a standard module re-export.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The only point of concern is the reliance on an external package `poetry_multiproject_plugin`, which warrants trust verification, but this is outside the scope of the code snippet itself.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are mostly zero, with some reports assigning a very low (0.1) score due to dependency trust considerations, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or issues:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. No anomalies or assumptions are unjustified.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n- The only minor note is the dependency trustworthiness, but the code itself remains safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified in the code itself)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify external dependencies' trustworthiness separately, but the code snippet itself is safe.",
