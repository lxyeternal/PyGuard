{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify Python import statements in source files, replacing module names with a namespace-based path.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from disk; parses them into AST; reads module names and import nodes.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified source code back to files if changes are made.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> parses AST -> mutates import nodes if applicable -> unparse AST -> writes back to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code dynamically rewrites import paths but does not do anything inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads Python files, parses the AST, and conditionally rewrites import statements based on provided namespace mappings. The functions perform straightforward string manipulations and AST node modifications. The code only performs source file modifications without network access, external command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code insertion are evident. The only notable activity is code rewriting, which could be misused to hide malicious imports if misused, but as-is, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a utility for namespacing or restructuring import paths in Python source files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply rewrites import statements based on provided parameters, which is a benign operation. No malicious intent or malware characteristics are detected.",
