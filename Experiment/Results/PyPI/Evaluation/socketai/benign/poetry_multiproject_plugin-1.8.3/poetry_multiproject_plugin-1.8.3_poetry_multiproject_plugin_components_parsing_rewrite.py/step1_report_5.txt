{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify Python import statements within source files by rewriting module paths based on a given namespace mapping.",
  "sources": "File system reading files with open(), reading source code from files specified by pathlib.Path objects, and ast.parse() which processes the source code content.",
  "sinks": "Writing modified source code back to files with open(). No direct untrusted data sink such as network or database is present.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading source code from files -> Parsing into AST -> Modifying AST nodes -> Unparsing AST -> Writing back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code performs straightforward AST manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script reads Python source files, parses them into an AST, modifies import statements that match specified namespaces by rewriting their module paths, and writes back the updated source code if changes occur. It operates purely on static source code files, with no network or external system interactions. The functions are straightforward and seem to serve a code transformation purpose. There are no signs of malicious activity or malware behavior, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or stealthy backdoors. The code appears to be a utility for refactoring import statements within codebases, which is common in code maintenance or modularization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs static source code transformations on import statements without any malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility script for source code modification.",
