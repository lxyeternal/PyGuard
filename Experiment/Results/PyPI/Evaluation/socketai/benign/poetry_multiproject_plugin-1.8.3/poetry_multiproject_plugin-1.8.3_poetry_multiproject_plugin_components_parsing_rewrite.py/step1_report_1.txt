{
  "purpose": "This code modifies import statements in Python source files by rewriting module paths based on a provided namespace mapping.",
  "sources": "Reading source files from disk using open(), parsing source code with ast.parse, and reading import nodes during AST traversal.",
  "sinks": "Writing back modified source code to files with open().",
  "flows": "Source: Reading source files -> Parsing AST -> Mutating import nodes -> Writing back source files if mutations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code observed. The code only modifies import paths based on provided namespace parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script reads Python files, parses their AST, and mutates import statements by prefixing certain namespaces with a top-level namespace. It then rewrites the source files if mutations occur. The logic is straightforward and only involves source code modification, with no network activity or malicious side effects. The code appears to serve a refactoring or namespace management purpose. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. All operations are limited to file reading, AST manipulation, and writing back source code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for modifying import statements based on provided namespace mappings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware within this code. It functions solely to refactor import paths and does not perform any harmful actions.",
