{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to read Python source files, identify import statements, and modify their namespace paths based on provided mappings, then rewrite the source files with the updated import paths.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from disk and parses them into an AST; reads import nodes within the AST.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to source files on disk if modifications are made; potentially unsafe file overwriting.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> Parses into AST -> Mutates import nodes -> Unparses AST -> Writes back to source files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors. The code performs straightforward AST manipulation. No suspicious network activity or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code parses Python files, modifies import statements to change their namespace paths based on a list of target namespaces, and rewrites the files if any changes occur. It uses standard Python libraries (ast, pathlib) without external dependencies. The logic appears straightforward and solely focused on namespace rewriting. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The file overwrite operation occurs only after safe AST manipulation and unparse. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard source code modification utility aimed at namespace rewriting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The file handling is controlled and limited to source files. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
