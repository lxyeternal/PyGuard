  "purpose": "The code imports a function called rewrite_module from a specific package component and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.parsing.rewrite'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of rewrite_module; no data flow or external untrusted data processed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no unusual patterns. The import path is standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a package module and defines __all__ to expose this function. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network calls, file modifications, or obfuscated code. It does not process data or execute code dynamically. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate standard practice without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement used to re-export a function from a package component. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks present.",
