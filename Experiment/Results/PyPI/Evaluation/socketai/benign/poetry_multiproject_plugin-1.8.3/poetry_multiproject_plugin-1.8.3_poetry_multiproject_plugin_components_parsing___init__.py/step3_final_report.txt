  "purpose": "Import 'rewrite_module' from a specific package component and expose it via __all__ for module interface purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement: 'from poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.parsing.rewrite import rewrite_module'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'rewrite_module'; there are no data flows or external interactions in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single component and exposes it via __all__, which is standard practice. All reports agree that this code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The security posture depends on the contents of 'rewrite_module', which cannot be assessed here. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores are near zero, justified by the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity. The confidence in benignity is high. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The overall security posture is very safe, contingent on the trustworthiness of 'rewrite_module'. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
