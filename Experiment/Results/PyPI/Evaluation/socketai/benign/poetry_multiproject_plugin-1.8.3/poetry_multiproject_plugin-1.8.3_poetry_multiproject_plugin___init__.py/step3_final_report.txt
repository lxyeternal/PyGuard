  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python module by importing a class from an external package, setting a version string, and defining exportable symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from external package 'poetry_multiproject_plugin.plugin'",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace; no data flows to external systems or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and variable definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from an external package, defining a version, and setting __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, user input, network activity, or data leaks. The import source is external but untrusted code is not executed or manipulated here. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The external dependency's trustworthiness is outside this snippet's scope. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal risk. No modifications are necessary.",
