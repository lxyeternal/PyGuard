  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing a class from an external package, defining a version string, and an `__all__` list.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n- The reported malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious behavior?**  \n- No. The code only imports a class, sets a version, and declares exports.  \n- No data flows, no user input, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n\n**Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning?**  \n- No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.  \n- They do not overstate or underestimate the risk.  \n- The consistent conclusion that the code is safe is justified.\n\n**Are the scores appropriate?**  \n- Malware scores are 0, which is correct.  \n- Security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n**Any anomalies or suspicious claims?**  \n- No. All claims are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the package `poetry_multiproject_plugin` is an external dependency, its trustworthiness depends on its source, but the code snippet itself does not introduce any malicious behavior.\n- The reports correctly do not assume malicious intent based solely on the import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, justified by the minimal code, but considering the dependency import, a slight risk exists if the package is malicious, but there's no evidence here)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Metric          | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Risk            | 0.1    |\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the trustworthiness of external dependencies, but based solely on this code snippet, there is no security concern.",
