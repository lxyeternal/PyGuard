  "purpose": "Automates dependency installation ('mypy') and static type checking within a specified directory using Poetry, managing directory navigation and subprocess execution.",
  "sources": "Function arguments for command parameters, current working directory via Path.cwd()",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'poetry add mypy' and 'poetry run mypy', directory change via os.chdir()",
  "flows": "Function parameters -> subprocess commands; directory navigation -> subprocess execution; output filtering for 'error:' lines",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; subprocess commands are standard and controlled; no suspicious network activity or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management and static analysis tasks with controlled subprocess calls and directory navigation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The subprocess commands are parameterized and do not process untrusted input directly. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code's operations are typical for build automation scripts, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for dependency installation and static analysis, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
