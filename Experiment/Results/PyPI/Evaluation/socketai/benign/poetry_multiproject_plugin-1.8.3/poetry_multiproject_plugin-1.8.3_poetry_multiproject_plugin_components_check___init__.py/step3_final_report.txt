  "purpose": "This code re-exports the function 'check_for_errors' from an internal module within the 'poetry_multiproject_plugin' package, serving as a module interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a function from an internal package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import and export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement that exposes a function via __all__, with no data handling, external effects, or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and standard structure confirm the absence of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
