  "purpose": "Export the function check_for_errors from the mypy_checker module within the poetry_multiproject_plugin.components.check package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing check_for_errors from an internal module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import flow from internal module to current namespace; no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export statement, typical for modular Python projects. It imports a specific function from an internal package and exposes it for external use via __all__. No data handling, user input, or external network interactions are present. The code is minimal, clean, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to re-export a function from an internal module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
