  "purpose": "This code imports a function named check_for_errors from a specific module within a package, and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a function from a package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet as it only performs an import statement and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a package and defines an __all__ variable to control module exports. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an interface to expose a single imported function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
