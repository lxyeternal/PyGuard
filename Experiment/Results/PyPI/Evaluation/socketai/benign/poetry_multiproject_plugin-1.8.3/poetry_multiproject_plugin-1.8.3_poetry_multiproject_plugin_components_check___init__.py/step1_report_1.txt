  "purpose": "Exports the 'check_for_errors' function from the 'mypy_checker' module within the 'poetry_multiproject_plugin' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'check_for_errors' from an internal module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources are evident; no sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple import and export statement",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module export statement, importing a specific function and exposing it in '__all__'. There are no input sources, data handling, or system interaction. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or indicate malicious intent. The structure is clean and typical for module exports in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a module interface with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
