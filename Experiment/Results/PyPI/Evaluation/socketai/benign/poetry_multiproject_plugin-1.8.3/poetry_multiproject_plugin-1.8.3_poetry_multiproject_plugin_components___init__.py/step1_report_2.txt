  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger application, although the specific task is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user input or external files (if present in the full code). It may also process data from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file writing, or executing commands, depending on further code which is not provided. No explicit dangerous operations are visible in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input through processing functions and potentially to network or file output (if present). The exact flow cannot be fully determined without additional code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated code or unusual language features in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic operations, importing modules, possibly reading environment variables or user inputs, and executing functions. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network communication in the visible fragment. Without more context, no malicious patterns are detected. The overall structure is typical for a utility or application code segment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard and does not contain malicious behaviors or obfuscation. Confidence is moderate due to limited context.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
