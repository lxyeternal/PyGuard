  "purpose": "Manage Python dependencies using Poetry, configuring virtual environments and installing packages.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (destination, is_verbose), subprocess calls for Poetry commands, current working directory for navigation.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via subprocess, directory changes affecting system environment.",
  "flows": "Function parameters control subprocess commands; directory navigation affects current process environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; subprocess commands are static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency setup with Poetry, configuring virtual environments and installing dependencies. It uses subprocess to run system commands with static arguments, and directory navigation is handled carefully with restoration. No untrusted input is processed, and no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are standard for dependency management, and the code structure is straightforward. Risks are minimal, primarily related to subprocess execution, but inputs are controlled. Scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for dependency management with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is very low risk.",
