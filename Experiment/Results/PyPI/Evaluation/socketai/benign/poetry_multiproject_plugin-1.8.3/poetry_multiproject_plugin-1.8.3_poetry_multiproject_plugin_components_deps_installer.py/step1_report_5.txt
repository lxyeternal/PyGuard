  "purpose": "Configure Poetry environment settings and install project dependencies in a specified directory",
  "sources": "Function parameters (destination: Path, is_verbose: bool), os and subprocess modules used to execute commands and change directories",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run commands executing Poetry CLI commands that modify environment settings and install dependencies",
  "flows": "Code reads destination path and verbosity flag, then executes Poetry commands that modify virtual environment configuration and install dependencies in the target directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious commands; code modifies Poetry config and installs dependencies, which is standard for dependency management",
  "analysis": "The script adjusts Poetry virtual environment settings and installs dependencies in a specified directory. It does not include any network communications, data exfiltration, or malicious file modifications. It solely interacts with Poetry CLI for dependency management, which is a legitimate operation. No obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The subprocess calls are for standard package management tasks. Overall, the code appears to perform normal setup activities without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for managing project dependencies with Poetry. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely configures and installs dependencies as part of a typical project setup.",
