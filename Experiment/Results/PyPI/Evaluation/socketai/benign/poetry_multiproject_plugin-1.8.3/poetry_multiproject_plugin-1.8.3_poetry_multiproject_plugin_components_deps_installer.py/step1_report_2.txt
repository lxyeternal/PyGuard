  "purpose": "Configure and install Python dependencies using Poetry in a specified directory, ensuring a reusable virtual environment.",
  "sources": "User-supplied 'destination' Path parameter and environment variables related to current directory.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing Poetry commands, which could potentially run malicious scripts if the Poetry configuration or environment is compromised.",
  "flows": "navigate_to(destination) changes the working directory, then subprocess.run executes Poetry commands that may run post-install scripts or hooks, then navigate back to original directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present. The code interacts with subprocesses but only calls standard Poetry commands.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manages directory navigation and executes Poetry commands to configure virtual environments and install dependencies. It uses standard subprocess calls without dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious scripts. The subprocess commands are standard for dependency management and do not pose security risks in this context. The code appears to be straightforward automation for dependency setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign automation utility for managing Poetry virtual environments and dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks identified based on this code fragment.",
