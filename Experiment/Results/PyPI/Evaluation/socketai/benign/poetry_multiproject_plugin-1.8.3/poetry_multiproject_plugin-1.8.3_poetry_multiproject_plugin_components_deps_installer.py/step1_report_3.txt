  "purpose": "Configure and run Poetry commands to manage Python virtual environments and install dependencies in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'destination' parameter for directory navigation and 'is_verbose' parameter for verbose mode control.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls execute system commands ('poetry config' and 'poetry install') which can affect system environment and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The function navigates to the specified directory, configures Poetry settings, installs dependencies, then returns to the original directory.",
  "anomalies": "The code consistently uses subprocess to run system commands with no input validation or sanitization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands are present. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script manages virtual environments and installs dependencies via Poetry, which is a common and legitimate task. It switches directories safely, executes Poetry commands, and restores the previous working directory. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The subprocess calls are predictable and directly related to environment setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate environment setup and dependency installation with no malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected. It poses no security risk based on the provided content.",
