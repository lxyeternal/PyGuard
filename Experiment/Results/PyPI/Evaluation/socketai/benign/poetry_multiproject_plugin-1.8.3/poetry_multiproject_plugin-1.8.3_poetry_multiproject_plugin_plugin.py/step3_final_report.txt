  "purpose": "Register custom commands 'build-project' and 'check' for Poetry to facilitate multi-project or monorepo workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from poetry.console.application, poetry.plugins.application_plugin, and custom command modules (project, check).",
  "sinks": "Registration of commands during plugin activation; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define plugin class -> activate method -> register commands with application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Poetry plugin that registers two commands for project management. It imports standard modules, defines a plugin class, and registers commands during activation. No malicious behavior, network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical plugin patterns. Scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Poetry plugin registration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
