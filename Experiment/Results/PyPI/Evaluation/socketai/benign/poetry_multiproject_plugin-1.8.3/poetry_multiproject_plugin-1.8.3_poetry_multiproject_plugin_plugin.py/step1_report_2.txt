  "purpose": "This code defines a Poetry plugin that adds custom commands for building and checking projects, particularly for monorepos.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Poetry Application and plugin classes; import of project and check command modules.",
  "sinks": "Method calls registering command factories with the Poetry application object.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define plugin class -> activate method -> register custom commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious command registrations beyond standard plugin extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core Poetry plugin components and two custom command modules. It defines a plugin class that, upon activation, registers two custom commands ('build-project' and 'check-project') with the Poetry application. These commands are intended to facilitate project management in monorepos. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward extension of Poetry's plugin system to add project-specific commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Poetry plugin extension for managing multi-project setups. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
