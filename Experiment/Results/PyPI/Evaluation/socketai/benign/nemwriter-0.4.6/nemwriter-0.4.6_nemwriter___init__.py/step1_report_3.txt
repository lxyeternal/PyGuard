{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for writing meter readings to specific AEMO data files, serving as part of a larger system for energy data management.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.nem12_writer, .nem13_writer, .version), which may contain additional code and logic.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration routines are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code does not execute data flows or contain any logic that processes or transfers data; it only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This module acts as an interface or API layer, importing classes responsible for writing specific data formats and exposing them for use elsewhere. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external communications. The imported modules could contain security issues, but based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initialization script, importing and exposing classes related to energy data writing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
