  "purpose": "To provide functionality for writing meter readings to specific AEMO NEM data files (NEM12 and NEM13).",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.nem12_writer, .nem13_writer, .version), which may load additional code or data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks or external network connections present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and includes no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a module with a descriptive docstring, importing specific classes and variables from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving to organize exports.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a standard module initialization file, simply exposing classes and version information.",
