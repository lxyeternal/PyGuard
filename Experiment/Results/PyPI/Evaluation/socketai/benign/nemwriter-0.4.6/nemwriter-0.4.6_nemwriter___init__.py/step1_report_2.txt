{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for writing meter readings to specific data files related to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) NEM12 and NEM13 standards.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.nem12_writer, .nem13_writer, .version) that may contain the core logic or data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this snippet; potential data sinks depend on the imported modules' implementations.",
  "flows": "Data and function calls likely flow from the imported modules to any external use of the classes or variables defined here; however, no direct data flow or untrusted input handling is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python import statements and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an entry point or interface, importing specific classes and version info for external use. There are no input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations within this snippet. It appears to be a typical module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard module interface for meter reading data writers with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe based on the provided content.",
