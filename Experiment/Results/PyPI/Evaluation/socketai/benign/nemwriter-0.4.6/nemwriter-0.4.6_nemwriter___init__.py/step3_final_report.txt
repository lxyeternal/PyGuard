{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports classes for writing energy meter data files (NEM12 and NEM13) and exposes them along with version info for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes and a version string from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports and exports symbols without executing logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward module setup with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, likely an __init__.py, that imports classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The code is clear, simple, and standard for package initialization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The imported modules may contain core logic, but from this snippet alone, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious indicators. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
