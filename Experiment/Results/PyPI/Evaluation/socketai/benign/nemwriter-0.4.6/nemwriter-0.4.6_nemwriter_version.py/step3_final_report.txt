  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks are present; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources and sinks; the code simply assigns a string value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, dependencies, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
