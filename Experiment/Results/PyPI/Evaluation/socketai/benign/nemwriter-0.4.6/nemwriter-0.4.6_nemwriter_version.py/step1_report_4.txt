  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as a string variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment from a hardcoded value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a version string; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no input reads, no external data sources, and no operations that could lead to security issues. The absence of functions, logic, or external interactions indicates that this code fragment is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
