  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports indicate no obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - The scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Risks**:\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, the risk is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary; the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis provided by all reports.",
