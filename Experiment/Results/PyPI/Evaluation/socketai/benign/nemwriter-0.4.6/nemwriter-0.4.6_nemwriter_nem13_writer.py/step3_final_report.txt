{
  "purpose": "Create and export energy meter readings in NEM13 format, supporting CSV and ZIP outputs.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via method parameters during readings addition; system time for filenames.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to local CSV or ZIP files; no external network or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "add_reading() stores data in internal dictionaries; build_output() generates rows; output_csv/output_zip() write files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs structured meter reading data, formats timestamps, and writes to files using standard libraries. No external calls, code injection, or obfuscation present. The use of datetime.now() for filenames is standard. The data handling appears secure, with no hardcoded credentials or network activity. The scoring of malware as 0 and obfuscation as 0 is justified. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to file operations, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for generating energy meter data files. No malicious or obfuscated content is present. The current security scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
