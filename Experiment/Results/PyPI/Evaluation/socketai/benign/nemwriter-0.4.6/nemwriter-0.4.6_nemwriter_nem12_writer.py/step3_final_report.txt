  "purpose": "A utility for processing energy meter readings and writing them in NEM12 format files, supporting data from pandas DataFrames or lists, and exporting as CSV or ZIP.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrames or list-based readings, extracting timestamps, values, qualities, and event descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted CSV or ZIP files containing meter readings; no network or external system calls involved.",
  "flows": "Data is extracted from DataFrames or lists, processed into internal structures, and then written to files via CSV or ZIP streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks: converting DataFrames to channel data, organizing readings by date, calculating interval positions, and outputting files. It employs in-memory CSV handling with StringIO and standard file I/O for output. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for energy data formatting and output. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal security risk score reflects standard in-memory CSV handling, which is safe and common practice.",
