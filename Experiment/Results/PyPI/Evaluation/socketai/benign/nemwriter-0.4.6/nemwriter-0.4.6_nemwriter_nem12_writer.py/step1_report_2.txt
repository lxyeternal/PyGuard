{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and writes NEM12 meter readings into CSV and ZIP files for energy data reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrame, method parameters, and datetime objects; reads and processes readings, timestamps, and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to CSV files and ZIP archives; uses file I/O operations to save output files; writes CSV content into ZIP archives.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame or parameters -> processed and stored in internal structures -> output generated via build_output() -> written to CSV/ZIP files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors or suspicious logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or external network connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes energy meter readings, converts data formats, manages readings by date and interval, and outputs formatted files. It performs standard data handling and file I/O without suspicious activity. All external interactions are limited to file writing, with no network or system command execution involved. No anomalous patterns or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate data processing and file generation utility for energy meter data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
