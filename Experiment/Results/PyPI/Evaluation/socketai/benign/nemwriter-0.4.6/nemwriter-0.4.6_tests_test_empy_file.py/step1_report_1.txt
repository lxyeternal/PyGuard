  "purpose": "Unit tests for NEM12 and NEM13 classes to verify error handling when output files are empty",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via class instantiation and method calls; no external data sources are explicitly read",
  "sinks": "Output file creation (output_zip), which writes to the filesystem",
  "flows": "Instantiation of NEM12/NEM13 → calling output_zip → writing to 'tests/empty.zip'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. The code is straightforward test code, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing framework pytest and classes NEM12 and NEM13 from an external module. It defines two test functions to verify that calling output_zip on instances of these classes with an empty dataset (implied by no data setup) raises a ValueError. The tests check error handling, not data processing or external communication. No untrusted input sources or suspicious code flows are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. It appears to be standard test code designed for unit testing error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing code for verifying error handling in the NEM12 and NEM13 classes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
