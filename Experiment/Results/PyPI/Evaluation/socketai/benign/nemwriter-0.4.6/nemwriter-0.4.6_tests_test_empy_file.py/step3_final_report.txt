  "purpose": "Unit tests for classes NEM12 and NEM13 verifying that output_zip raises ValueError when data is empty.",

  "sinks": "Writing to local filesystem (tests/empty.zip)",
  "flows": "Instantiation -> output_zip -> filesystem write",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; only filesystem interaction in test context",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing for error handling when generating empty ZIP files. It does not involve external data sources, network calls, or malicious behavior. The filesystem write is controlled and typical for tests. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor filesystem interaction does not elevate risk significantly. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
