{
  "purpose": "The code reads, processes, and exports NEM13 CSV files, performing data cleansing and validation to ensure data consistency during import-export cycles.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input CSV files specified in TEST_FILES, and reads NEM files using nemreader library.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output CSV files via m.output_csv, and reads input files with open().",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files and NEM files, processed within import_export_nem13(), then exported to new CSV files; during testing, original and exported files are compared.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or file modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data processing and validation for NEM13 files, using standard libraries and methods. It reads input files, processes data via nemreader, and writes output CSVs. The cleanse_val function removes unnecessary decimal points. The test function compares original and exported files for consistency. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or anomalous behavior. Third-party libraries are used normally, and no suspicious data flows or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing and testing utility for NEM13 CSV files. There are no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
