  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality involving external libraries. Without specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or possibly external files and network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or sensitive data exposure through print statements or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching network or file sinks, but specific paths are not explicitly clear from the code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or obfuscated code features detected. Unusual dynamic imports or use of exec/eval are absent. No hidden backdoors or malware indicators identified.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard use of Python libraries with typical data flow. No signs of malicious payload, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or cryptomining activities. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious code constructs or obfuscated segments. Usage of third-party libraries appears justified and benign. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are evident. Overall, the code appears normal and secure based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose, with no indications of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
