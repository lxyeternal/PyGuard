{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import, process, and export NEM12 files, specifically reading CSV files, converting them into a custom format, and exporting the data either as CSV or ZIP archives for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files ('examples/actual_interval.csv', 'examples/multiple_quality.csv', 'examples/interval_change.csv', 'examples/year_example.csv') and potentially untrusted data within these files.",
  "sinks": "Reading data from CSV files; no significant sinks for untrusted data are present. Export functions write to files but do not handle untrusted data dynamically.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV file reading (source) through processing in 'import_export_nem12' (potentially untrusted input), then into 'add_readings' and finally exported via 'output_csv' or 'output_zip' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of standard Python libraries and straightforward processing.",
  "analysis": "The script reads CSV files containing NEM12 data, processes readings, and exports them, including test functions that validate data integrity post-processing. There are no signs of malicious payloads or external network activity. The code's logic is standard for data import/export and testing. No code injection, data leakage, or hidden behavior identified. The process appears benign and focused on data transformation and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file reading, data processing, and export functions without any malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe for use.",
