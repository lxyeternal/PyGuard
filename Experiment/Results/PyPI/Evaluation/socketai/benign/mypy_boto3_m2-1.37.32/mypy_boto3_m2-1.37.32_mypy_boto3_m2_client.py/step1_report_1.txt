{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 M2 service, providing a typed interface for AWS operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class methods with kwargs unpacking request types.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept untrusted input via **kwargs and unpack request type definitions, potentially influencing AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (kwargs) flows into API calls through method parameters, which are directly passed to AWS SDK functions.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of **kwargs with Unpack of request types; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; methods appear to be straightforward API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for a boto3 client with no executable logic or data processing. It imports necessary modules, defines a client class with methods that accept parameter unpacking, and includes overloads for pagination methods. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The methods serve as a structured interface to AWS services, with no evidence of covert operations or data exfiltration. The use of kwargs unpacking is standard for boto3 stub implementations and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and stub class for AWS boto3 client. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security risks beyond typical API interface design. It is safe and intended for type safety and IDE support.",
