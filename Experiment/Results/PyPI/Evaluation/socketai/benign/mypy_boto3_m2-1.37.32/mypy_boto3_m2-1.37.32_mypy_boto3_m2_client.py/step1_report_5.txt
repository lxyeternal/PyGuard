{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS Mainframe Modernization service SDK, providing type safety and documentation references.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and overload decorators.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious actions; all methods are wrappers for AWS SDK calls with standard parameters.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks is observable; functions mainly define API call signatures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard SDK interface with extensive type annotations and overloads; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface for the AWS boto3 client, enhanced with precise type hints and overloads for paginator methods. It imports standard modules and internal type definitions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or suspicious behaviors. The code serves to facilitate type-safe interactions with AWS services, and no external or untrusted data manipulation is evident. All components conform to typical SDK design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate SDK interface implementation with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It provides type annotations for AWS SDK calls, and no malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
