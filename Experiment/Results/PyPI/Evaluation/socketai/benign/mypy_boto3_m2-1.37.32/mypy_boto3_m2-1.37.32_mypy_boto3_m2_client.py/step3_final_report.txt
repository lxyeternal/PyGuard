{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for boto3 AWS MainframeModernization (m2) service, intended for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard typing modules, botocore classes, and request/response type definitions; method signatures with kwargs unpacking request types.",
  "sinks": "API method signatures accepting kwargs, no runtime data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows into API calls via kwargs unpacked from request type definitions; no dynamic code or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; purely static interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured SDK interface stub with extensive type annotations, overloads for paginators, and documentation links. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All signals indicate a benign purpose aligned with IDE support and type safety. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK stub for the AWS MainframeModernization service, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score (0.05) in one report is justified as a conservative estimate but does not indicate actual danger. All reports are consistent in identifying the code as benign and well-structured.",
