  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code is a type annotation and client class definition for the boto3 M2 service, primarily for type safety and IDE support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept kwargs unpacked from request types, which are standard for boto3 stubs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is that the code is safe, with high confidence (1), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing type annotations for the MainframeModernization (m2) client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods are straightforward, with no dynamic code or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage. The code is a stub with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a type stub for the AWS MainframeModernization client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows; methods are simple signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK type hints.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for the SDK client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flows; purely static type hints.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes the code is a static type definition with no runtime logic, which is accurate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with a slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still very high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected; the assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, SDK interface with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows or malicious payloads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, well-structured SDK stub for AWS boto3, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The use of **kwargs with unpacking request types** is standard in boto3 stub implementations.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks beyond typical SDK interface design)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the purpose of this code as a type stub/interface for AWS SDK, the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero as well.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and intended for static type support. No malicious or suspicious elements are present.",
