  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK stub for the AWS MainframeModernization service, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score (0.05) in one report is justified as a conservative estimate but does not indicate actual danger. All reports are consistent in identifying the code as benign and well-structured."
