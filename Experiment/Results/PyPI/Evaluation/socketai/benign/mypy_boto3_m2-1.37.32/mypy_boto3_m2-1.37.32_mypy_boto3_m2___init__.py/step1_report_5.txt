{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the AWS Mainframe Modernization (M2) service, mainly exporting imports and paginator class references for easy access.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input data; it imports modules and defines class aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and primarily involves module imports and class aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific client and paginator classes from internal modules and defines an alias for the main client class. It then exports these classes for external use via __all__. There are no input data reads, no network or file operations, and no dynamic execution. The copyright statement and documentation link are benign. The structure is typical for SDK interface modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK interface setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply provides access to AWS M2 service classes and does not perform any risky operations.",
