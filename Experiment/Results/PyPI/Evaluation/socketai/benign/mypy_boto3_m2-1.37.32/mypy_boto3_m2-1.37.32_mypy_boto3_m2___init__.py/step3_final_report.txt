{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module that imports client and paginator classes for AWS Mainframe Modernization (M2), sets up an alias for the main client class, and exposes these via __all__ for external use. It also includes documentation and usage examples.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and string literals; no external data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not perform network operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes and defining an alias, with no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, structural setup for an SDK interface, importing classes from local modules, defining an alias, and exporting symbols. It contains no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. The documentation and usage examples are benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports accurately reflect its safe and straightforward nature.",
