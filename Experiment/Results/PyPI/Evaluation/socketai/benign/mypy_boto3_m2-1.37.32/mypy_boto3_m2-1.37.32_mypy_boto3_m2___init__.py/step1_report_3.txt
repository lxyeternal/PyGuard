{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface for the AWS Mainframe Modernization (m2) service, providing imports and exposing classes and paginators for use in client code.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module's own imports and string documentation comments; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it contain code execution, network operations, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily sets up imports and exposes objects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard module setup and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with imports from local files, documentation comments, and exports a set of classes and constants for client usage. It does not perform any runtime data processing, external connections, or sensitive operations. The comments provide usage instructions and links, but no dynamic or external data handling is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard setup for a Python SDK package.",
