{
  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface and imports for the AWS Mainframe Modernization service SDK, acting as a wrapper for client creation and paginator access.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.client and .paginator), which define the client class and paginator classes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the client class and makes paginator classes available for use; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, mainly importing and exporting classes and setting up a client alias.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules, defines a client alias, and specifies exported symbols. It includes documentation and usage examples, but no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data transmission occurs within this snippet. It appears to be a standard SDK interface setup with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK wrapper for AWS service interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates client and paginator access without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
