{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with the AWS Mainframe Modernization (M2) service, including client initialization and paginator setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator) and module-level variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data writes or network calls within this code",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from external sources to sinks; primarily module imports and variable definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The license and documentation references are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python module structure: documentation, license info, usage example, and imports. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or potentially malicious logic is present. It only defines imports, an alias, and exports, all of which are typical for an SDK or API wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK module for AWS M2, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a clean interface for API calls and paginator setups.",
