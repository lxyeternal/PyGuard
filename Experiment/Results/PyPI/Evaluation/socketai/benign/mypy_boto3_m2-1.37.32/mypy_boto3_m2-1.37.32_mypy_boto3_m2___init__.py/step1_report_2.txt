{
  "purpose": "Defines the main interface and imports for the m2 service client and its paginators, facilitating interaction with the AWS Mainframe Modernization (M2) service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), documentation link, copyright statement, and the example usage code block.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily imports modules and defines exports. No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code sets up class and function references for client interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The example code is standard usage documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules and sets up an alias for the main client class. It also provides an example usage snippet for client initialization and paginator setup. No user input processing, network calls, or data handling occurs directly here. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities within this module. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of a copyright statement and documentation link, which are typical for open-source modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward interface layer for the AWS M2 service SDK components, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and primarily focuses on module imports and exports.",
