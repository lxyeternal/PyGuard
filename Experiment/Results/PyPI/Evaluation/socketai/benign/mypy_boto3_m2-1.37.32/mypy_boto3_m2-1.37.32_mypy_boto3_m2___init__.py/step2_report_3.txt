  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward SDK module: it imports classes, defines an alias, and exports symbols.\n- There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n- The documentation and example usage are benign.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Confirmed as a standard interface for the M2 SDK.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; the reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; confirms standard SDK setup.  \n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above; straightforward module setup.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Again, a typical SDK wrapper.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious elements.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as others; module for AWS M2 SDK.  \n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code content.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n- Since the code is a simple SDK interface, high risk or malware scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \nNo changes needed; all scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign SDK module with no malicious or risky elements.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
