  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers, statuses, regions, and other constants.\n- The code uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No external input handling, network communication, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n- The purpose is purely for static type checking, autocompletion, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is purely declarative with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or anomalies:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, static set of type aliases.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n- The conditional import pattern is standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified because there is no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Any unreasonable scores?\n- No. The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe, static type definition module.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
