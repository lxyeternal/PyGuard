  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various string literals used in AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing modules, defines string literal types with possible values, assigns these to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code is purely declarative, defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, checks Python version for importing Literal, and defines multiple string literal type aliases representing AWS resource names, statuses, and regions. No external input handling, no data manipulation, nor network or system calls are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, safe type definition module for static type checking. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious code constructs. The presence of standard type annotations and straightforward declarations indicate normal, benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK resource identifiers. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely for type checking and documentation purposes.",
