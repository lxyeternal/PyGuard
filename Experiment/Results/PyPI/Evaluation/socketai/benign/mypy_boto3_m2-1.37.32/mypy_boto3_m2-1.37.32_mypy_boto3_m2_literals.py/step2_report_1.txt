  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, and service identifiers.\n- It includes a version check for importing `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions`, which is standard practice.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for static type checking and autocompletion.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The license comment and import logic are standard and benign.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Type aliases for AWS SDK string literals.  \n   - Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external data handling, straightforward.  \n   - Malware score: 0.0 — correct.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0 — justified.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Purpose: Type literals for AWS service names, resource types, constants.  \n   - Analysis: No suspicious patterns, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n   - Malware score: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Purpose: Type literals for AWS service identifiers, paginator names, regions.  \n   - Analysis: Standard static definitions, no malicious activity.  \n   - Malware score: 0.0 — accurate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Purpose: String literals for AWS resource types and states.  \n   - Analysis: No signs of malicious intent, purely static type annotations.  \n   - Malware score: 0.0 — correct.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS service literals.  \n   - Analysis: No dynamic code, no external data, benign.  \n   - Malware score: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- All reports agree the code is benign, straightforward, and solely for static type checking.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` is standard for compatibility.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any runtime operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The malware score should be **0.0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0.0**.\n- The overall security risk is negligible; the code is purely for type annotations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0        |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK resources, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should reflect its safe, static nature.",
