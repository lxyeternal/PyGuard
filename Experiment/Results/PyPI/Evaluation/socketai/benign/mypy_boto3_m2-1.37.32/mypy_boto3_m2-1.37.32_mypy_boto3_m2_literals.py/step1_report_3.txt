{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service strings and paginator names used in boto3 stubs for type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Import of sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to send data over the network, write to files, execute code dynamically, or interact with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The license comment appears standard, and the import logic is typical for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version and defines numerous string literal types for AWS services, regions, paginator names, etc., to assist with static type checking. The structure is straightforward and consistent. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, backdoors, or obfuscation. The license and comments are standard for open-source code. No dynamic execution or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless type annotation module that provides string literal types for AWS service names, regions, and other identifiers, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
