  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, etc.\n   - No external input handling, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - The code uses standard practices like version checks for importing `Literal`.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**\n   - The code consists solely of type alias definitions for static string literals.\n   - These are intended for static type checking, autocompletion, and documentation support.\n   - The structure is straightforward, with no complex logic, data flow, or runtime behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, transparent code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious behavior, no external data, and the code is purely for static typing, the overall security risk should be minimal, close to 0.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The only point of note is the version check for `Literal`, which is standard for compatibility.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK resource identifiers.\n   - It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at **0**.\n\n### Personal Estimation:\n- Given the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is a safe, standard utility module for static type annotations in AWS SDK usage.",
