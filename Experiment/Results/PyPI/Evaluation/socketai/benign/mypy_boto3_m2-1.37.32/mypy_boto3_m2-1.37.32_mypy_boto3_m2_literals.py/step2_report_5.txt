  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors**  \n   All reports consistently identify that the code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, statuses, regions, and service names. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network communication, data exfiltration, or any suspicious logic. The conditional import for `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for type annotations. The variable names and string literals align with AWS SDK conventions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The risk scores are also 0.0, reflecting no security threats. The obfuscated score is 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited. The purpose is purely for static type checking, documentation, and autocompletion.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**  \n   The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable. No report suggests any malicious intent or security risk that warrants a higher score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Final Justification:\nThis module is a standard, benign set of type aliases for AWS SDK resource identifiers, statuses, and names. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, and no external interactions. The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely declarative. The scores assigned are appropriate.**",
