{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SDK service names, resource types, and pagination/region constants to be used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Reading the module import statements, the version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. All literals are assigned to variables directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not involve data input/output, network operations, or handling of untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines constants and types, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution found. The code uses standard type annotations and version checks. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS service names, resource types, and pagination options using 'Literal' types for static string values. The version check ensures compatibility with different Python versions when importing 'Literal'. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be malicious. The purpose appears to be purely for type safety and improved code correctness. No anomalies or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module defining string literal types for type annotations related to AWS SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
