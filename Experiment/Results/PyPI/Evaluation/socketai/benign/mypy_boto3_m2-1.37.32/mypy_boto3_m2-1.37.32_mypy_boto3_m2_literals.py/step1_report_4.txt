{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS service identifiers, deployment states, and other enumerations used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables; import of sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data sources or external data processing; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static string assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code logic. The code is purely type annotation setup with no runtime behavior or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for string literals used as enumerations for various AWS resource types and states, with conditional imports based on Python version. It includes standard documentation comments and is intended solely for type hinting, with no dynamic or executable behavior. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical static type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type aliases for static typing with no malicious intent or security risks present. It simply defines string literals for AWS resource identifiers and states to aid type checking. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
