{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals used in boto3 stubs for type safety and code completion.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal; definitions of string literal types and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external network or file operations; no data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines type aliases and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for compatibility is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. All string literals are safe, used for type definitions. No unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types and constant lists for AWS resource names, paginator names, regions, and service names. These are intended for type hinting in boto3 AWS SDK usage. No external data input, no network activity, and no runtime code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward, primarily for type safety and auto-completion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type aliases and constants for AWS SDK type annotations. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior, serving as a utility for type checking.",
