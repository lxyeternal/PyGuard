  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS-like service data structures.\n- Findings: No runtime data handling, no external inputs, no suspicious code.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is purely static type definitions with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions and data structures for boto3_m2 service API.\n- Findings: Static schemas, no runtime logic, no external data processing.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely for static type annotations. No signs of malicious activity. Malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS service data models.\n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard SDK type definition module. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for SDK data structures, including potential untrusted data fields.\n- Findings: No runtime logic, no dynamic execution, no malicious code, just data schemas.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The presence of fields accepting untrusted data is typical for API schemas, not malicious. The code remains static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for API request/response schemas.\n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely static type definitions, standard for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** No indications of supply chain threats, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive set of static type annotations for an SDK or service API.\n- No runtime logic, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The conditional imports are standard practice for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are detected.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, purely structural, and designed for static type checking. No security threats or malicious behavior are evident.",
