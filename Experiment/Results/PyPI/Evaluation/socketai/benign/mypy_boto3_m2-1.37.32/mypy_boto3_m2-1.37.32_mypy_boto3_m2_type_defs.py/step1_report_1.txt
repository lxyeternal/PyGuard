  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS-like service data structures related to applications, datasets, environments, and jobs.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals, __future__ imports, sys.version_info checks, and all class/type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; mainly data structure definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely type definitions and static annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports standard modules and typing extensions, then defines numerous data structures with no runtime logic. No external data inputs, network calls, or code execution pathways are present. The absence of runtime behavior, external input handling, or dynamic code execution indicates this is a static type definition module. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for service data structures. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. No anomalies or suspicious code segments are present. The module is safe and purely structural.",
