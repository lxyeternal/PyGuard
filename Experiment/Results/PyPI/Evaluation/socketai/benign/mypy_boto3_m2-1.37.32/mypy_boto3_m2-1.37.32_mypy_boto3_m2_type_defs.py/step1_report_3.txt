  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS M2 service data structures and request/response formats for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imported modules, type annotations, class definitions, and literal types.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code mainly contains type definitions and no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "None; type definitions serve as schemas without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and imports for AWS SDK stubs. No runtime logic, input handling, or network operations are present. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard typing conventions for AWS SDKs, with conditional imports for compatibility. There are no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS service data models, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a schema library for type hinting and code completion, and poses no security threat.",
