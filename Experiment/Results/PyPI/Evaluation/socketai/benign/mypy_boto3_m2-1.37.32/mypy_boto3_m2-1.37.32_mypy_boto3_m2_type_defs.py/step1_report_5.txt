{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS-like service API requests and responses related to application deployment, datasets, environments, and jobs, primarily for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and imported modules; no runtime input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code defines data structures without executing untrusted input or external calls.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines types and data schemas, not runtime data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of TypedDict class definitions for API request and response structures. It uses conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, which is standard practice. No functions, runtime data handling, or external calls are present. The import of literals and the definitions of types suggest static type annotations. The code does not contain any code that performs data manipulation, I/O, or network activity. All elements are well-structured type definitions for API data schemas. No signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for a service API, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be purely for type checking and documentation purposes. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
