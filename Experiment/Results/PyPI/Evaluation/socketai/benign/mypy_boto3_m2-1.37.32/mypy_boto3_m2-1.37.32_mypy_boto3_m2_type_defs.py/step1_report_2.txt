{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions and data structures for interacting with the boto3_m2 service API, primarily used for SDK type annotations and data validation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and data structure definitions. Specifically, it reads static type annotations, imported literals, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Data structure instantiations, type annotations, and metadata responses. No sinks execute untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The code defines data schemas and type aliases; there are no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. No dynamic execution, code injection, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on defining data schemas via TypedDict and Union types, with conditional imports based on Python version compatibility. No runtime logic, external data processing, or network interactions are present. All data structures are static and intended for type safety. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type definitions and static data schema declaration, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate SDK type definition module for the boto3_m2 service.",
