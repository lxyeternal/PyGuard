  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, logical flaws, or overlooked aspects.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on static type definitions, imported literals, and version-based conditional imports.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or runtime logic; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as purely static type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of runtime or external data handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations and data structures.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime data processing or external interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the code as solely static schemas, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, aligning with the static, safe nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, type annotations for AWS SDK-like data models.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No evidence of dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard SDK type schema with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, consistent with the code's static, schema-only purpose.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for API request/response schemas.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic or external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the code is purely static type definitions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on static data schemas.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly concludes the code is purely for static type annotations without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, matching the static, safe nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of `TypedDict` definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and static type annotations.\n- **Runtime Behavior:** No runtime logic, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- **Potential for Malicious Activity:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Supply Chain Concerns:** The code appears to be a standard SDK type definition module, with no signs of tampering or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding techniques)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, static set of type definitions intended for SDK type safety and documentation. It poses no security threat or supply chain risk. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is purely static type annotations and data schemas.  \n- No runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns are present.  \n- The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and risk are justified as zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code is safe and does not present any supply chain security concerns.",
