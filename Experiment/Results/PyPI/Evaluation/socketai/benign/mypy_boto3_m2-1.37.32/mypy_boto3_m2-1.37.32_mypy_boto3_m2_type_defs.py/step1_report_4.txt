{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for the M2 service data structures used in a Python SDK, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type definitions, class and variable declarations, and type annotations throughout the module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data inputs in request/response data structures, especially in fields like 'definition', 'tags', 'parameters', 'location', 'externalLocation', and 'responseMetadata'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (e.g., API responses, user-provided data) into data structures such as request/response types, but there are no explicit runtime data flows or dynamic execution within this static type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code, code injection, or unsafe dynamic execution detected. Use of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version appears standard. No suspicious network activity or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions (TypedDict, Union) and conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It adheres to best practices for static type annotations, with no signs of runtime logic, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious. The fields mostly define data schemas for API requests and responses, with no embedded executable code or external calls. The presence of response metadata fields and structured data models aligns with standard SDK design, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves to ensure type safety and clarity in data handling. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
