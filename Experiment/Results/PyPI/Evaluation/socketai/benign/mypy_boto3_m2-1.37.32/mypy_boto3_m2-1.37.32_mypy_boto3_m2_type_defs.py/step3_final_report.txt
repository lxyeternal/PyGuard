{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python SDK or API client, primarily using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Code contains only static class definitions, type annotations, and conditional import statements; no runtime data handling or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic execution or data flow.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; definitions are static and do not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for data models used in an SDK, with conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There is no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The fields are typical for API schemas, and no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of conditional imports and type annotations aligns with best practices for SDK development, and the absence of any runtime or network activity confirms the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, static set of type annotations and data schemas for an SDK or API, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use, serving solely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
