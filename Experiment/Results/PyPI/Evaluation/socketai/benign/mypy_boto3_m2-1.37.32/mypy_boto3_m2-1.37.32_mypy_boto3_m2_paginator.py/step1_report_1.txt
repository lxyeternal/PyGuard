{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and pagination classes for the boto3 m2 service client paginators, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters via **kwargs; data from sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs of various type definitions, but do not process untrusted input directly. No sinks related to network, file, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "User calls paginate() with arbitrary keyword arguments; these flow into the method parameters, but are only unpacked into predefined type definitions; no data is transmitted or processed maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code adheres to standard type annotation practices, with conditional imports for compatibility. No suspicious dynamic execution or data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for the boto3 m2 client, each with a paginate method that takes kwargs unpacked into specific type definitions, returning a PageIterator. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import based on Python version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network operations, data leaks, or backdoors. All imports are from legitimate libraries or local type definitions. The code structure and comments are consistent with open-source SDK helper code. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, type-safe implementation of boto3 paginators with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments. The confidence level is high.",
