  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for the AWS 'm2' service client, enabling type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters using Unpack with request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which are unpacked with specific request type definitions. No untrusted data sources or external inputs are evident; the code primarily defines type annotations and class structures.",
  "flows": "Class methods 'paginate' accept **kwargs unpacked as specific request types, returning PageIterator with response type defs. No external or untrusted data flows are present; data flow is confined within type annotations and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code strictly adheres to type annotation patterns for SDK paginator classes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of conditional import for 'Unpack' is standard and justified by Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS 'm2' service with appropriate type annotations, leveraging Python's typing system for static analysis and IDE support. The use of 'Unpack' in method signatures enables flexible and precise typing for request parameters. The code contains no dynamic execution, external data reading, or malicious constructs. It is a straightforward, well-structured type definition module for SDK paginator classes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-safe definition of paginator classes for AWS SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to facilitate type-aware pagination, improving developer experience and code correctness. No malicious or sabotage-related elements are detected.",
