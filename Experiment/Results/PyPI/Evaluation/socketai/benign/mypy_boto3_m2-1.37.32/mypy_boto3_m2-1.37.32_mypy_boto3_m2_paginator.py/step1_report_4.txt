{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 m2 service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses from the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the imported type definitions, system version info (sys.version_info), and method parameters via **kwargs in the paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could originate from user-supplied parameters in **kwargs passed to paginate methods, but these are just type annotations; no actual data processing or external output is involved.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data in **kwargs flows into paginate methods, which return PageIterator objects; no external sinks or network interactions are directly embedded in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, mainly consisting of class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The only unusual aspect is the extensive use of type annotations for SDK interface definitions, which is standard for type stub modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of Python type annotations and class definitions for AWS boto3 paginator interfaces. It employs conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, and it leverages TYPE_CHECKING to differentiate runtime from type-only code. The classes inherit from generic Paginator classes and override paginate methods with precise type annotations. No suspicious operations, external data access, or harmful code patterns are present. The code serves solely to facilitate type safety and IDE support, with no runtime effects or external data handling beyond type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of type stub definitions for boto3 M2 service paginators. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as an interface layer for static type checking and IDE autocompletion.",
