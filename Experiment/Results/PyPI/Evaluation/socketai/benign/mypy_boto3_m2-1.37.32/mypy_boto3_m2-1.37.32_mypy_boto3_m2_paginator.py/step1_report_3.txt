  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for AWS boto3 m2 service client, providing type annotations and pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods accepting kwargs with specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept kwargs that are unpacked and used in calls to the underlying PageIterator; no other data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input source (kwargs) flows into the paginate methods, which call the parent class's paginate with these args, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be standard class and method definitions for pagination with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for AWS boto3 m2 service, each inheriting from a generic Paginator. The paginate methods are correctly typed with unpacked request type defs, returning PageIterator with response type defs. The import statements and type aliasing for version compatibility are standard. No code injection, malicious data handling, or obfuscation detected. All logic appears to be documentation, type annotation, and class structure for paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, type-annotated paginator class definitions for boto3 service, with no malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It primarily serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 pagination.",
