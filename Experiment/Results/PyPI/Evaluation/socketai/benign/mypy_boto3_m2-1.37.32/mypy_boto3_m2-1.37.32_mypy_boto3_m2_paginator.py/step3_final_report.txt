  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 M2 paginators, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, local type_defs, and conditional import of Unpack; no external data sources or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs, unpack into predefined request types, and return PageIterator; no external data flow or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "kwargs unpacked into request type definitions within paginate methods, returning PageIterator objects; no external or untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward, serving as static type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK stub module defining paginator classes with type annotations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and no runtime logic or external data handling. The methods accept kwargs unpacked into specific request types, returning PageIterator objects, with no network activity or data leaks. The code's purpose is purely static type support, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence score is high (1), malware risk is zero, and security risk is negligible (0), except for a conservative note in one report which can be adjusted to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves solely as static type annotations for boto3 paginators. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
