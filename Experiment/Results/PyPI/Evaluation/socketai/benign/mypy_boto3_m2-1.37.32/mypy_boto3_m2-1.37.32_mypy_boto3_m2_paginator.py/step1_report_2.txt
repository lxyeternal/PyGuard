  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the M2 service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python version to import Unpack; imports paginator classes; imports type definitions; defines paginator subclasses with paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept untrusted keyword arguments, which are unpacked into type-defined parameters, and return PageIterator objects. No untrusted data is used directly in system or network operations.",
  "flows": "User calls paginate with keyword arguments -> arguments unpacked into type definitions -> returned PageIterator may iterate over untrusted API responses, but the code itself only defines structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code strictly defines class structures and type annotations for paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured setup of paginator classes with type annotations, extending boto3's Paginator class. It includes conditional imports for typing support, defines subclasses with the paginate method annotated with specific request types, and uses type-checking guards. No network activity, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior are evident. The purpose is purely to add type safety and structure for API pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators related to the M2 service. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for type-safe API pagination support.",
