{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-m2', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package data; reads environment variable for Python version in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to or executes untrusted input; no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content and environment variable for Python version; passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging. It reads a local Markdown file for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or insecure practices are present. The environment variable 'python_version' is used only to conditionally specify dependencies and is standard practice. The code appears purely declarative with no malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
