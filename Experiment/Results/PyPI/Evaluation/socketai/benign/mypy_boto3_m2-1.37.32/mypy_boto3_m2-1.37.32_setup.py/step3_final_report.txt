  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-m2'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static arguments to setup() -> package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script with no dynamic code, network activity, or embedded secrets. It reads a local README.md for description and specifies dependencies with environment markers. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
