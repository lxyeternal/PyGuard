{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'mypy-boto3-m2' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily reads local files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content to assign to variables, then passes static configuration data to the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. No external data sources or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads a local README file to include as a long description. It then calls the setup() function with static metadata, package information, and dependencies. All operations are straightforward, with no code execution based on untrusted input, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
