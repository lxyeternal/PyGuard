{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-m2 package, used for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; static metadata such as package name, version, author info, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all data used for package configuration is hardcoded or read from trusted local files.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> passes static metadata to setup() call; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no suspicious code patterns. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a local README.md for description, importing setup, defining metadata, and calling setup() with static arguments. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. All data sources are static or local files, and no suspicious sinks or flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It safely performs package configuration with static data and trusted sources.",
