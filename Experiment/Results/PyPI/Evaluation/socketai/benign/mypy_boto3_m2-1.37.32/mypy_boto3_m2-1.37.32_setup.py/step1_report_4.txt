{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package metadata and configuration for 'mypy-boto3-m2', a type annotations package for boto3 services.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description and includes package data, but does not read or process external data beyond file reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the script purely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md file for long description, and defines package setup parameters including metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or insecure practices are evident. The code adheres to typical Python package setup conventions with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and typical for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
