  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging, with no dynamic code, network activity, or embedded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the script's standard nature, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns; standard packaging script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the use of environment variables for conditional dependencies, which is common and safe in setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the benign nature, with no dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms the script's standard, static configuration nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** All reports correctly identify the script as a benign setup configuration with no external data processing or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no indication of security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The provided setup script is a standard, well-structured Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
