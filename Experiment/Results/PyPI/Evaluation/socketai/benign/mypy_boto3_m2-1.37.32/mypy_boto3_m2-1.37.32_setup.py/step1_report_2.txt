{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-m2 library, providing metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No significant untrusted data sinks; no external command execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily initializes package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The script follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and invokes setuptools.setup() with predefined package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are static and explicitly defined. All code appears standard for a Python package setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely specifies package information and dependencies without executing untrusted code or including suspicious logic.",
