  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious or suspicious—likely an oversight or intentional future-dated statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet provided matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is a standard pattern used in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The only point to note is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- The overall assessment aligns with expectations.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- The reports do not consider the future copyright year \"2025.\" While this is not a security issue, it could be flagged as a potential anomaly or typo. However, since the focus is on security and malicious behavior, this is not critical.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign version declaration with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code snippet is safe and typical for its purpose.",
