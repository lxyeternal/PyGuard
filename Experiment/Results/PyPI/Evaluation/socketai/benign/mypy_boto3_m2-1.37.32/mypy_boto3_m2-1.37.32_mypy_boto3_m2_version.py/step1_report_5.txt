  "analysis": "The code is a minimalistic version declaration with a copyright comment. It does not include any input processing, data handling, or execution of untrusted code. The only notable aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious or suspicious, rather a possible oversight or forward-looking statement. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
