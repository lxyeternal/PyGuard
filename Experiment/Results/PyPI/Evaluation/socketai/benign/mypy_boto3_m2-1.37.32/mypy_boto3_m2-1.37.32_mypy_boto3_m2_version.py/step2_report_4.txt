  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their findings, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are detected in any report.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious or suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static assignment with no dynamic or untrusted data sources.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws or logical errors are present in the reports; they are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code content.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a simple version string declaration with no dynamic or suspicious elements, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- Malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only point of note is the copyright year \"2025.\" While unusual, it does not introduce any security risk or malicious intent. It might be a typo or a future-dated statement, but it does not affect security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code snippet and reports, I concur with the provided scores.** The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security or malware risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern elements. The reports are accurate and reasonable.",
