  "purpose": "Define the version of the package using a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "The assignment is direct; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025,' which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no dynamic code, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs. The only minor anomaly is the future year '2025,' which is likely a typo or oversight but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks or malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
