  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, data flows, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future but not inherently suspicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet is straightforward and does not contain any issues. It is a typical version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports, since there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all analyses correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future. This could be a typo or an oversight but does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static version string assignment with no dynamic or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security risks or malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
