  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains only a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a comment about the source of truth for versioning and assigns a static version string to __version__. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external dependencies. The code appears to be a standard version declaration commonly used in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a version indicator for the package and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical, benign version declaration.",
