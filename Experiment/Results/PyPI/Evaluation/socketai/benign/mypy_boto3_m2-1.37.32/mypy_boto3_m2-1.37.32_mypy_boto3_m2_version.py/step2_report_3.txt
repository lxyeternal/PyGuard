  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, data flows, or external dependencies are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The copyright year \"2025\" is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious or suspicious per se.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippet itself does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n**Potential issues or points of note:**\n- The future copyright year (\"2025\") is atypical, but this is more of a content inconsistency than a security concern.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external dependencies are involved, so no attack surface exists here.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard version declaration.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a typical, benign version indicator with no security risks or malicious intent. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but might be corrected for accuracy.",
