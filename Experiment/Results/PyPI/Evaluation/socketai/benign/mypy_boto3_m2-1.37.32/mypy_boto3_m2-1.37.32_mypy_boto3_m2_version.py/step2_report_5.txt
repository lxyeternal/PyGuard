  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The only notable point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this alone is not suspicious or malicious.\n\n**Confirmation of code content:**\n- The code snippet is a standard version declaration, with no logic or data processing involved.\n- All reports correctly identify that this is benign, typical code for versioning in Python packages.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that there are no security issues or malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future. While unusual, it does not indicate malicious intent; it could be a typo or a forward-looking statement.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the benign analysis.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard version string declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are needed.",
