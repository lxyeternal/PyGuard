  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version.\n- It checks for a \"--version\" argument; if present, prints version; otherwise, prints package info.\n- The code uses straightforward functions, no dynamic data, no external network calls, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The script is minimal, with no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations.\n- The logic is clear, and the output is static, intended for informational purposes only.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or supply chain compromise.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- They also assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports correctly do **not** assume any malicious intent based solely on static output.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is purely based on static code review.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations, external calls, or data processing that could introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risks.",
