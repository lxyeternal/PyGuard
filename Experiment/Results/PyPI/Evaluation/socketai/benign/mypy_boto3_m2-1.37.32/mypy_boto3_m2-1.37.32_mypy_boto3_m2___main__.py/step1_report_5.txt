  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 MainframeModernization.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version data)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward and mainly for informational output.",
  "analysis": "The script defines simple functions to output package info and version details, triggered via command-line arguments. No user input is processed beyond argument check. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code performs basic output operations only, with no obfuscated or dynamic execution, and no external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI entrypoint for displaying package info and version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard utility code.",
