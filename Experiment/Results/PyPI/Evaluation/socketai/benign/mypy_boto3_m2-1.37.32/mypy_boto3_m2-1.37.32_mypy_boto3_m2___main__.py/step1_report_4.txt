  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package and its version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs information; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI entry point that outputs package info or version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output via sys.stdout.write. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious actions. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. The functions are straightforward, and the code adheres to standard practices. The license comment does not contain sensitive information, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply outputs static package information based on user input.",
