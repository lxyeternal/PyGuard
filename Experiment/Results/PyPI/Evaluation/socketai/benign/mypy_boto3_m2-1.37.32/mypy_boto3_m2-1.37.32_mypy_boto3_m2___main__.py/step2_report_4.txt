  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, with confidence 1 and malware/security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code is simple and static, with no signs of issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The logic is sound, and the reasoning in reports is accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. All are zero, consistent with benign code.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  Correct. No malicious activity is present, so malware score is 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on static analysis and observed behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility for displaying static information.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is straightforward, and the outputs are static, making malicious behavior impossible.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Overall recommendation:\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of this script, I agree with the existing scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign, serving a standard informational purpose with no security concerns.",
