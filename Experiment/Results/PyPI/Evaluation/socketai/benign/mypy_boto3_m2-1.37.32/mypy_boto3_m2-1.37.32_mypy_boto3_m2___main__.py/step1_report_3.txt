  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it checks for a '--version' argument and prints version info; otherwise, it prints package details. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The functions serve solely to display static text. The code is minimal, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI interface for displaying static package info and version. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
