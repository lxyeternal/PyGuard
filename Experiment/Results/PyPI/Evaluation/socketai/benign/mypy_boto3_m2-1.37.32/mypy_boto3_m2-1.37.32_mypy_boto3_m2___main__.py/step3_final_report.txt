  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details for a CLI utility.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static output and no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static information or version based on argument presence. It does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, contains no external network calls, no secrets, and no obfuscation. The functions are simple, and the logic is clear. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's static nature and straightforward output indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
