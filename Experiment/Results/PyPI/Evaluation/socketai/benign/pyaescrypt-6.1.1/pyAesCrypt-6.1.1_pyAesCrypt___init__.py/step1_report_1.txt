  "purpose": "Import cryptographic functions for file and stream encryption/decryption",
  "sources": "Import statement from local 'crypto' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; potential use of imported functions elsewhere",
  "flows": "No executable code; import statement alone does not create data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statement itself",
  "analysis": "This code snippet only imports functions from a local module named 'crypto'. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors visible in this import statement. Without additional code execution, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The functions imported suggest encryption/decryption capabilities, but their use is not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement of cryptographic functions with no evident malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet. Further context would be needed to assess actual use cases.",
