{
  "purpose": "This code imports cryptographic functions for encrypting and decrypting files and streams, likely for data confidentiality purposes.",
  "sources": "The imported functions from the local module '.crypto' that may internally handle input data for encryption or decryption.",
  "sinks": "The functions themselves act as sinks where untrusted data could potentially be processed insecurely if not implemented correctly, but based solely on the import statement, no direct sink behavior is visible.",
  "flows": "The data flow would typically start from external input, be passed to these functions for encryption or decryption, but such flow details are not provided in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are visible in the import statement itself; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports cryptographic functions from a local module. Without further implementation details, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The functions could be used securely or insecurely depending on their internal implementation, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The import pattern is standard for modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import of cryptographic functions. Further review of the 'crypto' module is necessary to assess security implications.",
