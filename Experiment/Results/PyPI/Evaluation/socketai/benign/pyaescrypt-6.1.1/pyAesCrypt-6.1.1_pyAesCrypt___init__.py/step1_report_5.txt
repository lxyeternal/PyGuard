{
  "purpose": "This code imports cryptographic functions related to file and stream encryption/decryption from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.crypto' when importing functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is evident in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a module import of cryptographic functions, which is a standard operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this snippet. Without further context or the actual implementation of 'encryptFile', 'decryptFile', 'encryptStream', and 'decryptStream', there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement of cryptographic functions from a local module, with no evident malicious or security risks.",
