  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on the import statement: `from .crypto import encryptFile, decryptFile, encryptStream, decryptStream`.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The functions are cryptographic utilities, which are common in security-related code.\n- The confidence levels vary between 0.6 and 1, but the core conclusion remains that this is a benign import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code only imports functions; no other suspicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent: import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Security risk scores are mostly zero or very low, which is appropriate.\n  - Confidence scores are high (mostly 0.8–1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Since the code only imports cryptographic functions, which are standard, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The only exception could be if the functions are used insecurely elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly set to zero; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that further context is needed to determine security implications.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical notes:\n- The reports do not overstate potential issues; they maintain a cautious but reasonable stance.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on this snippet, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  *No evidence of malicious code.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  *Code is straightforward; no obfuscation detected.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1  \n  *Minimal risk, purely import statement.*\n\n- **Overall:**  \n  The code is benign; the import of cryptographic functions alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement with no malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. Further security assessment would require examining the implementation of the imported functions and their usage in the larger codebase.",
