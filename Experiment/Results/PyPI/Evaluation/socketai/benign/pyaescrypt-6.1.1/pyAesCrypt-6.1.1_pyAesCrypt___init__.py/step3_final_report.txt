  "purpose": "Import cryptographic utility functions from a local module for encryption and decryption operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet; functions are imported but not invoked.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of cryptographic functions, which are standard in security modules. No executable code, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident. The functions' internal implementations are unknown, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The import statement is typical and benign. Given the limited context, there is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import of cryptographic functions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, and security risks, with high confidence in this assessment.",
