{
  "purpose": "The code imports cryptographic functions for file and stream encryption/decryption, likely for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'crypto' module, which may read or load cryptographic functions or data.",
  "sinks": "Usage of imported functions as sinks if invoked elsewhere; no direct sink in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable in this snippet since it only contains import statements without execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; straightforward import of cryptographic functions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions: encryptFile, decryptFile, encryptStream, decryptStream from a local module named 'crypto'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or hidden backdoors, in just an import statement. The module name suggests cryptographic operations, which are common in security-related code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. Without additional context, this appears to be a legitimate import statement for encryption utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for cryptographic functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
