  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and score justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports functions; no executable code or data flow. No secrets or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.6, malware 0, security risk 0 — reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Risk score justification:** Since no actual code execution or data handling is shown, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, only import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, security risk 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** Correct, as no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- **Overall:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous, just imports.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only import statements, no code execution.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, malware 0, security risk 0.2 — the slightly lower confidence and minimal risk are justified.\n- **Risk score:** Given only the import, a risk of 0.2 might be slightly high; unless internal implementation is suspicious, it should probably be 0.\n- **Overall:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as no evidence suggests insecure behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, only import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores and justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** For import-only snippets, generally 0; only report 4 assigns 0.2, which seems unjustified without further context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven only these import statements, **the actual risk and malware scores should be 0** across all reports. The slight variation in confidence (0.6–1) is acceptable, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of context, but the security risk scores should be uniformly 0 unless there's evidence of malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk based solely on import statements)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate in their assessments that the code snippet is benign. The only minor correction is to set the security risk score for report 4 to 0, aligning with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without further code or context, these import statements alone do not pose security risks. Any potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior would depend on how these functions are used in the larger codebase.",
