  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Initial code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .crypto import encryptFile, decryptFile, encryptStream, decryptStream\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is a simple import statement from a local module `.crypto`.\n- No executable code, data flows, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The imported functions suggest cryptographic operations, but their internal implementation is unknown.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the import of cryptographic functions; no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly states that the import is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import is standard and no suspicious patterns are visible.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes that the functions could be used insecurely, but the import itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) may be justified if the internal implementation is insecure, but the import statement alone doesn't imply this. Given the snippet, the risk score could be lower, perhaps 0.1.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the import statement itself is benign.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The only potential concern is how these functions are used elsewhere, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n### Final scoring recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, straightforward import.\n- **Risk score:** Since the import alone isn't risky, a low value like 0.1 or 0.2 might be more appropriate than 0 or 0.2, but given the context, 0 is acceptable.\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code snippet is a standard import of cryptographic functions.\n- No anomalies, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- The security risk score could be slightly reduced from 0.2 to 0, but 0.2 is acceptable if considering potential misuse in broader context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering potential misuse)\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the evidence: a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent.",
