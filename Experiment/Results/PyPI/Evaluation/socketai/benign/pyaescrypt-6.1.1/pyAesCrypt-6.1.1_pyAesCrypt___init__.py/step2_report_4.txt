  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Initial Code:**\n```python\nfrom .crypto import encryptFile, decryptFile, encryptStream, decryptStream\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code only performs a relative import of four functions from a local module named `.crypto`.\n- No data is processed, no secrets are hardcoded, and no execution occurs in this snippet.\n- The functions suggest cryptographic operations, but their internal implementations are unknown.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states that this is just an import with no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate confidence)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no evident risk)\n- **Comments:** This is a straightforward import; no issues here.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** No suspicious activity or anomalies.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Again, confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Standard import; no concerns.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Slightly more cautious, mentioning that functions could be sinks if misused, but the import itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated, but still low)\n- **Comments:** No actual data flow or suspicious patterns in the import.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Just an import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple import statement.\n- None of the reports suggest actual misuse or malicious intent based solely on this snippet.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the lack of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of an import statement.\n\n### **Potential issues in the reports:**\n- The reports assign a security risk of up to 0.2 in some cases, which is reasonable but perhaps slightly overcautious given the limited context.\n- Since no actual code execution, data flow, or suspicious patterns are present, the risk scores could be uniformly zero unless further context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from an import statement alone)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Import statements are standard in modular code.\n- No evidence of data leaks, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The functions could be used insecurely in the larger codebase, but this cannot be inferred from the import alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or suspicious behavior in import statement.          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | No obfuscation detected; straightforward import.                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No security risk evident from import alone; further context needed.        |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If additional code shows how these functions are used, or if the 'crypto' module contains malicious code, the scores might need reevaluation. But based solely on this snippet, the import is benign.",
