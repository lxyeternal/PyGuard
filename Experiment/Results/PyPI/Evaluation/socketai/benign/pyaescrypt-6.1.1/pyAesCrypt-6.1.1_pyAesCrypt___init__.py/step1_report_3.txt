  "purpose": "Import cryptographic functions for file and stream encryption/decryption",
  "sources": "Module import from .crypto (relative import of encryptFile, decryptFile, encryptStream, decryptStream)",
  "sinks": "None directly; functions imported may be used elsewhere for encryption/decryption processes",
  "flows": "Imported functions may be used as sinks for data, but no actual data flow present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import statement with no additional code or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "This code only imports four functions from a local module named .crypto. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no data processing in this snippet. The functions imported suggest cryptographic operations, but without implementation details, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code is straightforward and typical for modular cryptographic code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement for cryptographic functions and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a normal part of a larger codebase that handles encryption tasks.",
