  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements AES-256-CBC encryption/decryption with password stretching and HMAC for integrity. It handles headers, extensions, IVs, encrypted keys, and HMACs, with proper validation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. Known security weakness in the file format (lack of authentication for file size byte) is acknowledged but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  These are reasonable given the analysis. The low risk reflects the known format weakness, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Justification:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is standard cryptography, no backdoors, no suspicious behaviors. The security note about the file format is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard AES CBC, password stretching, HMAC, and format adherence. No suspicious code or obfuscation. The known vulnerability (lack of data authentication) is noted.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Justification:** Well-reasoned. The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility with known limitations, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard practices—AES CBC, password stretching, HMAC, secure randomness, format adherence, no suspicious behaviors. Notes the security limitation of the format.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Valid.\n\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard cryptography, secure randomness, format, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Acknowledges known security weakness.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cryptography, secure randomness, no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, low security risk due to known format limitations.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is justified, reflecting the known security weakness in the file format (lack of authentication for the file size byte), but not a malicious feature.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to the known security limitation in the file format, which is documented and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. No adjustments needed. The overall security posture of this utility appears sound, with the primary concern being the inherent weakness in the file format's lack of full authentication, which is acknowledged in the comments.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2",
