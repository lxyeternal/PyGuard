  "purpose": "A Python utility for AES-256-CBC file encryption and decryption with password stretching and HMAC integrity verification.",
  "sources": "File input streams, password input, random number generator for IVs and keys",
  "sinks": "Output encrypted/decrypted files, HMAC verification for integrity",
  "flows": "Password + IV stretch -> encryption keys; input file -> encryption stream -> output file; HMAC verification from header to data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; known security weakness in file format (lack of authentication for file size byte) acknowledged in comments",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic practices with AES CBC, password stretching, HMAC for integrity, and proper header management. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The only security concern is the known vulnerability in the AES Crypt v2 format, which does not authenticate the file size byte, allowing potential tampering of plaintext size. This weakness is documented and not malicious. No backdoors, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to best practices, with exception handling and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility with a documented security weakness in the file format, but no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the known vulnerability but not malicious intent.",
