  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the pyAesCrypt library, defining metadata, dependencies, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file, static package metadata, dependencies, and script path 'bin/pyAesCrypt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration with no data from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and scripts. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The script is straightforward and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The dependency on 'cryptography' is common for security-related packages and does not indicate malicious intent. The script 'bin/pyAesCrypt' referenced in 'scripts' could be inspected separately, but based on this code alone, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe package configuration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), which is appropriate for such setup scripts.",
