  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the pyAesCrypt Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file; package discovery via find_packages(); user-provided setup parameters.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input handling, user input, or network operations present; no data leaks or injections identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup script is static and for configuration purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads a README file, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or handling of untrusted inputs. It follows standard Python packaging patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No anomalies or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
