{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyAesCrypt', used for encrypting and decrypting files using AES encryption.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long_description; reads package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies; sources are mainly static data and external file read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that execute untrusted data, network communication, or system commands; it only prepares package metadata and installation instructions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; data flows are limited to reading static files and defining package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly handles package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (os, setuptools), reads a README file, and sets up package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, or backdoors. The script functions solely as a package installer configuration, which is typical for open-source Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a cryptography package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured setup file with no suspicious elements.",
