{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the pyAesCrypt Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file for long description, specifying package data, and defining package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data; the code primarily defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is static setup configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and reads a README file for long description. It configures the package metadata, including name, version, author, URL, dependencies, and files to include. The package dependencies specify the 'cryptography' library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code strictly adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for open-source project distribution.",
