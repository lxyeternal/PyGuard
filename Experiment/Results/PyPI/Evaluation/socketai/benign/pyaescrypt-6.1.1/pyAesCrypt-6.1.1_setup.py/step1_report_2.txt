{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the Python project 'pyAesCrypt'. It automates the installation process and package metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file for long description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and scripts to include in the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external command execution are present. The script specifies package configuration only.",
  "flows": "Input source: reading the README file. No flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; setup metadata and files are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses standard setup procedures without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' for file handling and 'setuptools' for packaging. It reads a README file to include in the package description. The setup() function specifies package details such as name, version, packages, author, URL, license, scripts, dependencies, and classifiers. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script, with no dynamic code execution or external commands. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure package distribution and metadata.",
