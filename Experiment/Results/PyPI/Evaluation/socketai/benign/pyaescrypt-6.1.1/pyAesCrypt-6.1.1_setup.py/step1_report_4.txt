{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyAesCrypt package, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup parameters are static and safe.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; only static configuration data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The script performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, no suspicious logic, and no malicious code. The use of 'cryptography' as a dependency is standard for security-related Python packages. All code is typical for a setup.py script, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
