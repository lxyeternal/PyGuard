{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated alias for the module 'panda3d.interrogatedb' and warns users to use the new module instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads a module import and a print statement based on the __debug__ condition.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no untrusted data processing or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs a conditional warning and an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecated alias with a warning, but nothing unusual or suspicious is evident. The print statement is conditional on __debug__, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and straightforward, consisting of a deprecation warning and a module import. It uses the __debug__ flag to conditionally print a warning message about deprecation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The import statement appears normal, and the warning is benign. The code does not contain any suspicious activity, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for deprecation notification. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
