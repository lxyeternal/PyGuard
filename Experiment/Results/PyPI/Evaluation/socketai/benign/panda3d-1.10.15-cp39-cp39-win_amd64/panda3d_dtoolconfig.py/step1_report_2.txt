  "purpose": "This module provides a deprecated alias for the panda3d.interrogatedb module, issuing a warning when used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __debug__ variable and outputs a warning message using print().",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs to standard output, which is generally safe and not a security risk.",
  "flows": "The __debug__ variable (source) triggers the print warning (sink) when __debug__ is true.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual behaviors; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if __debug__ is True, then prints a deprecation warning. It then imports the interrogatedb module from the current package. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. The code is simple, standard for deprecation warnings, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation alias with a warning and a module import. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
