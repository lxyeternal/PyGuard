{
  "purpose": "To provide a deprecated alias for the 'panda3d.interrogatedb' module, issuing a warning when in debug mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own import statement and the __debug__ global variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code checks __debug__ and conditionally prints a warning before importing a module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of deprecated warnings and import statements are normal; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily issues a warning if running in debug mode, then imports a module. It is straightforward and contains no malicious code or obfuscated constructs. No external input is read, and no sensitive data is involved. The import statement is standard. Overall, the code is a simple alias with deprecation warning, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign alias with a deprecation warning, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
