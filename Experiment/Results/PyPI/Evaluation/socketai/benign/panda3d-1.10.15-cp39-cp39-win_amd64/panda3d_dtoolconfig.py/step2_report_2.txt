  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward deprecation alias with a warning message.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious activity are detected.\n- The code uses a standard pattern: conditional print warning based on `__debug__`, then imports the new module.\n- The print statement outputs to standard output, which is safe.\n- No external input, untrusted data, or obfuscation is involved.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code does **not** contain any security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - It performs a simple deprecation warning and module import.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The pattern is standard for deprecation warnings in Python.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are high, matching the clear analysis.\n\n4. **Risk Justification:**\n   - Since there's no malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - The malware score of 0 is also justified.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume standard behavior; no assumptions are made about hidden vulnerabilities.\n   - No claims of potential vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My Reasoned Estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | 0            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            |\n| Security Risk     | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard deprecation alias with no security concerns. No further action is necessary.",
