{
  "purpose": "Provide a deprecated alias for the 'panda3d.interrogatedb' module with a warning message.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__debug__' variable and imports the 'interrogatedb' module.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Conditional check on '__debug__' leads to print warning; then the import statement loads the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward deprecation pattern with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally prints a deprecation warning when '__debug__' is true, then imports a module. No data is received from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, no malicious operations. The print output is benign, and the import is standard. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation alias with a conditional warning. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
