{
  "purpose": "This module provides a deprecated alias for 'panda3d.interrogatedb' and issues a warning when used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __debug__ built-in variable and imports from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking __debug__ and then importing a module, which is standard behavior.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the print statement is conditional on __debug__, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a deprecation warning message printed during debug mode, advising users to switch to a new module. It imports a module relative to its path without any user input or untrusted data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple deprecation alias with a warning; no malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
