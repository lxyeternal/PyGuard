  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code provides a straightforward deprecation alias with a conditional warning printed via `print()` when `__debug__` is true.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or complex logic are involved.\n- The import statement is standard and safe.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code correctly implements a deprecation warning and module import.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n   - The print statement outputs to standard output, which is safe and typical for such warnings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a deprecation warning with no malicious intent, the `malware` score should remain at 0.\n   - The `securityRisk` is also 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - The overall `risk` score should be minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The code is standard for deprecation warnings.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard deprecation alias with a conditional warning. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
