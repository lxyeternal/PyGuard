  "purpose": "Implements a scrollable text entry GUI widget in Panda3D, managing cursor movement, view scrolling, and event bindings.",
  "sources": "Entry object, GUI options, node properties, event bindings (DGG.CURSORMOVE).",
  "sinks": "Node position updates, event handlers, GUI element reparenting.",
  "flows": "Cursor movement triggers position calculations and canvas adjustments; event bindings invoke cursorMove; setEntry and clearEntry manage entry attachment/detachment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Panda3D GUI component managing a scrollable text entry. It uses standard API calls, event bindings, and node manipulations. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external data access are present. The functions handle cursor positioning, view adjustments, and cleanup in a typical manner. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk≈0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific GUI widget with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain risk is negligible, and the scores are appropriate.",
