  "purpose": "Manage deprecated Panda3D imports, issue warnings, and provide functions to access configuration objects.",
  "sources": "Import statements with exception handling for optional modules, deprecation warning print statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Import attempts to configuration functions returning a configuration object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from module import *'), which is a style concern but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard optional imports with exception handling, issues a deprecation warning, and defines simple functions returning a configuration object. No malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations are present. The use of wildcard imports is a style issue but not a security concern. The import handling is typical for optional modules, and the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for managing deprecated Panda3D imports and configuration access, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
