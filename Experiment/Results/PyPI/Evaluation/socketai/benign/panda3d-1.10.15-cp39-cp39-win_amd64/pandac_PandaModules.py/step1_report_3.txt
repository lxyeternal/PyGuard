{
  "purpose": "This code manages imports of various Panda3D modules, provides warning messages about deprecation, and defines functions returning configuration objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard import statements, module import errors, and predefined functions returning imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted data. No network, file system, or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from module imports to function returns, with error handling to manage missing modules. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily handles imports and deprecation warnings without suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The repeated import attempts with error handling are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the presence of multiple Panda3D modules, issuing a deprecation warning if running in debug mode. It gracefully handles ImportErrors, ignoring missing modules unless they are unexpected. Functions simply return a configuration module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The overall structure is straightforward, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import management script with deprecation warnings and error handling for missing modules. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
