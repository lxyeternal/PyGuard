  "purpose": "This code manages deprecated imports from the panda3d library and provides configuration functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various panda3d modules, and the print statement for deprecation warning.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code mainly performs imports and simple function returns without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module imports and print statements for warnings; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script warns about deprecated usage, then attempts to import several panda3d modules, handling ImportErrors gracefully. The imports are standard for a graphics or simulation application. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The functions return configuration objects without processing external data. Overall, the code appears benign, focusing solely on module imports and configuration access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and configuration setup with deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
