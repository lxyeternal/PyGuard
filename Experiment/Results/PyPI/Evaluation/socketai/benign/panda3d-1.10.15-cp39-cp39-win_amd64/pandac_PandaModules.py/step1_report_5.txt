{
  "purpose": "This module handles importing various submodules of the Panda3D game engine, with deprecation warnings and configuration access functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'panda3d' submodules, reading import errors and the __debug__ flag for printing warnings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "Imports are attempted from submodules; configuration functions return references to a module object.",
  "anomalies": "The use of broad 'import *' statements can obscure actual data flows. The code is mostly straightforward import and warning logic, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages module imports, issuing deprecation warnings and handling ImportError exceptions for missing modules. Functions simply return a configuration module reference. No input data is processed, and no suspicious code constructs or network activities are evident. The code appears to serve as a compatibility layer or deprecation notice for Panda3D module usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and deprecation warning implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or system modifications that could be malicious. The use of broad 'import *' statements is a concern for code clarity but not for security.",
