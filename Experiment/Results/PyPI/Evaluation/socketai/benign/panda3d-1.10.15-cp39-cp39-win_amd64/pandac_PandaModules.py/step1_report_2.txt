{
  "purpose": "The code primarily handles deprecated import warnings for the Panda3D engine modules and provides access functions for configuration objects.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports and multiple 'from panda3d.* import *' statements, which import modules from the Panda3D package.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output, network, or file operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Imports from Panda3D modules serve as sources; no data flow leading to sinks or external effects is present.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of wildcard imports ('from module import *') is generally discouraged as it can lead to unclear namespace usage but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning and attempts to import several Panda3D modules, handling ImportError exceptions appropriately. It defines simple functions returning a configuration object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code's primary concern is maintaining backward compatibility and informing users about deprecated modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that manages deprecated imports and provides configuration access without any malicious intent or security risks.",
