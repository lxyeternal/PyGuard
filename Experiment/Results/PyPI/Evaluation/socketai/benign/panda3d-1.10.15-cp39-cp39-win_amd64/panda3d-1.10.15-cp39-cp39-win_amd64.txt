      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility wrapper for external tools, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from reliance on external binaries and unvalidated inputs, which could be exploited if those binaries are malicious or environment is compromised. Overall, the script itself is low risk and safe if external binaries are trusted."
