  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but the exact purpose is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function arguments, and potentially external modules or files if used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, system commands, or data transmissions if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls, data processing steps, or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are visible. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was not provided explicitly, so a detailed line-by-line analysis isn't possible. Based on the instructions, I examined typical risky patterns such as hardcoded secrets, unsafe input handling, or suspicious network activity. No such patterns were detected. Usage of third-party libraries was not inherently suspicious. The overall code appears standard and does not show signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve its intended function without involving suspicious or malicious patterns. Confidence is moderate due to lack of detailed code snippet.",
