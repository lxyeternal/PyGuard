  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain security signals.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, files, network interfaces, or untrusted input streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, system command executions, network communications, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system actions), possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation techniques, dynamic code generation, or unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks concrete snippets; reports with no code correctly assign zero scores. Report 3 indicates potential dynamic features like eval, justifying moderate suspicion (malware score 0.2, obfuscated 0.4, risk 0.3). Other reports assume benign patterns with reasonable scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2-0.3). The scores are consistent with the described uncertainties and potential for obfuscation. Overall, the assessments are cautious and appropriate given limited information.",
  "conclusion": "No definitive malicious activity detected; some suspicion exists around dynamic features, but overall risk remains low. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
