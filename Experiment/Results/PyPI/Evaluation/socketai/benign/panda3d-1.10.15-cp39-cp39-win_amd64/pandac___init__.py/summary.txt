  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, but no definitive malicious payload is observed. It warrants further analysis in a controlled environment. Malware score is set at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.6, reflecting a cautious stance."
