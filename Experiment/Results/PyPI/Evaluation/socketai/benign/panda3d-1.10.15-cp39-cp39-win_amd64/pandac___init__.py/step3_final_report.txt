{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform dynamic code execution, environment variable handling, and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, dynamic eval/exec statements, input data (if any).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system (if writing or reading files), environment variables, eval/exec execution points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables → eval/exec or network activity → potential data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, network activity during package initialization, environment variable usage for control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with network activity that could be used for data exfiltration or command and control. The presence of eval/exec with obfuscated variables and environment variable checks suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. No explicit malicious payload is confirmed, but patterns are suspicious. The code's structure and behavior align with moderate malicious intent, warranting caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, but no definitive malicious payload is observed. It warrants further analysis in a controlled environment. Malware score is set at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.6, reflecting a cautious stance.",
