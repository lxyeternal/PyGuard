{
  "purpose": "The code defines the OnscreenImage class for rendering images in a 2D scene graph, providing methods to set images, configure properties, and manage the node.",
  "sources": "Input sources include image parameter (file name, NodePath, or Texture), positional and visual parameters (pos, hpr, scale, color), and model loading via loader.loadModel().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are texture loading (TexturePool.loadTexture), node assignment (assign), and property setters (setPos, setHpr, setScale, setColor).",
  "flows": "Image input (file name, Texture, NodePath) flows into texture loading or node assignment; positional and visual parameters flow into corresponding setters; configuration options via configure method modify properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. The code handles resource loading and scene graph management normally. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious control flow. Print statements for missing nodes/models are benign debug outputs. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a scene node for displaying images, with flexible input handling for images (textures, models, node paths). It performs resource loading via standard Panda3D functions, manages scene graph attachment, and provides configuration methods. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. It mainly manipulates graphical resources and scene nodes. All operations use standard Panda3D APIs, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for image display in Panda3D, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It responsibly loads resources, manages scene nodes, and provides configurable options. No malware, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The overall security risk score is very low.",
