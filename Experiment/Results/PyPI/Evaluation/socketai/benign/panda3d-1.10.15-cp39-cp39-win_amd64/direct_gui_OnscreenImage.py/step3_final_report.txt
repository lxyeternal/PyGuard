{
  "purpose": "This code defines the OnscreenImage class for displaying images in Panda3D, loading textures or models, and configuring scene nodes based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "External resource loading functions (TexturePool.loadTexture, loader.loadModel), input parameters (image, parent, transform, sort), and method calls (setPos, setHpr, setScale, setColor).",
  "sinks": "Loading textures/models, attaching nodes to scene graph, setting transformations and colors, which affect the rendering scene.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource loading (textures/models), then into node attachment and transformation methods, affecting the scene graph nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Error handling via print statements is benign. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Panda3D APIs for resource management and scene graph manipulation. It handles external inputs with error checks, assigns textures or models, and configures node transforms. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code structure is clear and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Panda3D utility class for onscreen images, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The resource loading and scene management are standard practices. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
