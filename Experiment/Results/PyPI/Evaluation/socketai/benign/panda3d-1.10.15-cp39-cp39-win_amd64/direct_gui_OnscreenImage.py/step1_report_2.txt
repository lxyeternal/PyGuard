  "purpose": "Define a class for displaying images in a 2D scene graph using Panda3D, with methods for setting images, configuring properties, and managing node lifecycle.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, self.setImage, self.setPos, self.setHpr, self.setScale, self.setColor, TexturePool.loadTexture, loader.loadModel, self.getParent, self.getTransform, self.getSort, self.removeNode, getattr",
  "sinks": "Texture loading via TexturePool.loadTexture, model loading via loader.loadModel, node copying, setting textures and transforms, printing error messages",
  "flows": "Input parameters (image, pos, hpr, scale, color) influence node creation and configuration; textures and models are loaded based on input; configuration options set via configure method affecting node properties",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. Use of print statements for error reporting instead of logging is not inherently malicious but is unusual. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution. Texture and model loading are standard practices. No malicious data leaks or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an OnscreenImage class for rendering images in a Panda3D scene, supporting image nodes, textures, and models. It carefully handles different input types for positioning, scaling, coloring, and image assignment. Texture and model loading are performed via standard Panda3D functions with error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or hidden backdoors are present. The code does not perform any suspicious operations outside typical scene graph management. Usage of print statements for errors is benign but not ideal. Overall, the implementation is consistent with typical graphical node setup, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a scene node class for displaying images in Panda3D, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate graphical utility class with normal handling of resources and configuration.",
