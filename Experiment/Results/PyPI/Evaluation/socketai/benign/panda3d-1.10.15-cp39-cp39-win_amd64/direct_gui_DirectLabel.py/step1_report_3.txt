{
  "purpose": "Defines a DirectLabel class inheriting from DirectFrame, used for creating GUI labels with multiple states in Panda3D.",
  "sources": "Imports from panda3d.core, local import of DirectFrame, class constructor, and setActiveState method.",
  "sinks": "Method call to self.guiItem.setState(self['activeState']) which changes the GUI element's state.",
  "flows": "Initialization options are merged and passed to parent class; setActiveState updates GUI element state based on class attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or malicious logic detected; code is straightforward and typical for GUI components.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GUI widget class with standard methods for initialization and state management. Imports are from Panda3D library and local modules, with no external data sources or suspicious data handling. The setActiveState method simply updates the GUI element's state. No input/output streams, network operations, or data leaks are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign GUI component with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GUI class implementation for Panda3D, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages GUI state without external data or network activity.",
