{
  "purpose": "Defines a GUI widget class 'DirectLabel' with multiple states for Panda3D, allowing user-controlled state changes.",
  "sources": "Imports from panda3d.core and local modules; class initialization; method 'setActiveState' calling 'self.guiItem.setState'.",
  "sinks": "The 'setActiveState' method invokes 'self.guiItem.setState', which updates the GUI element's visual state.",
  "flows": "Input to 'setActiveState' triggers 'self.guiItem.setState' to change the widget's display state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a GUI component, inheriting from 'DirectFrame', with options set during initialization. The 'setActiveState' method simply updates the GUI element's state via 'self.guiItem.setState'. There are no external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated constructs. The code's structure and behavior are typical for GUI widget classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard GUI class for Panda3D with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and should be set to zero for accuracy.",
