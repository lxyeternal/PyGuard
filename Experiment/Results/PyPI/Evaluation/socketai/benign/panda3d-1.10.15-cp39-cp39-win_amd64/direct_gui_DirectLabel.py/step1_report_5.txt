{
  "purpose": "Defines a GUI widget class 'DirectLabel' for creating labeled GUI elements with multiple states in a Panda3D application.",
  "sources": "Imports from panda3d.core and local modules; class constructor and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; class methods manage internal state only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition extending a GUI frame class, setting default options, and providing a method to change the widget's state. All operations are standard for GUI component setup. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The imports and class structure align with normal usage patterns for Panda3D's GUI system.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal GUI widget implementation with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.",
