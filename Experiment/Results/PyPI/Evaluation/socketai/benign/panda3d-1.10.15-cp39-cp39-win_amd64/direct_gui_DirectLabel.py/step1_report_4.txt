  "purpose": "Defines the DirectLabel class for creating GUI label widgets with multiple states in Panda3D.",
  "sources": "Imports from panda3d.core, local module DirectFrame, and class methods within DirectLabel.",
  "sinks": "Method setActiveState calls self.guiItem.setState(), potentially affecting internal GUI state.",
  "flows": "Initialization of options -> call to defineoptions -> setting of self['activeState'] -> call to setActiveState -> self.guiItem.setState()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. Usage appears standard for GUI widget setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core Panda3D modules and a local DirectFrame class, then defines a GUI widget class. The class sets up options and provides a method to change its state by calling self.guiItem.setState(). There are no external data inputs, network calls, or other data flows that could be malicious. The code appears to be standard GUI widget setup code without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard GUI widget class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code serves a straightforward purpose of creating a label widget with multiple states.",
