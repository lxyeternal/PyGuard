  "purpose": "This module is intended to import functions or classes from 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers', likely to be used elsewhere in the code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads external code or functions into the namespace; no flow of untrusted data observed.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the deprecation warning, indicating that the module is outdated and should be replaced, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with an accompanying deprecation notice. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions. The import could potentially pull in code from an external package, but this is a common practice and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The deprecation notice suggests the code may need updating but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
