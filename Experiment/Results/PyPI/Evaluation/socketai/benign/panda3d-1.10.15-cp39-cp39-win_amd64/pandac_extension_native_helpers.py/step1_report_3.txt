  "purpose": "Import functions or classes from the 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers' module, likely for use elsewhere in the program.",
  "sources": "The import statement sources code from an external module 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident within this snippet; potential sinks would depend on how the imported objects are used later.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on subsequent usage of imported components, which is not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is simple and does not contain anomalies; it is a deprecation warning indicating the module should not be used in favor of a new import path.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import operation from a specific module path, with an associated deprecation notice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. It is a standard import statement with a comment about deprecation. Since no further code or data handling is present, no suspicious activities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement with a deprecation warning. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be part of a normal transition process to a new module path.",
