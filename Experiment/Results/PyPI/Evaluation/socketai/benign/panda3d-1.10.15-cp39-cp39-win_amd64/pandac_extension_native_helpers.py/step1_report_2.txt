{
  "purpose": "This code is importing all functions and classes from the 'extension_native_helpers' module within the 'direct.extensions_native' package. Its purpose is likely to use utility functions or helpers defined there.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers' is a source of external data or code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible within this small fragment; it only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports everything from a module, which can sometimes hide malicious or unwanted functions, but this is common practice in some codebases and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that pulls all definitions from a specified helper module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The comment indicates deprecation, suggesting an ongoing transition rather than malicious intent. As it only performs a straightforward import, no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign import statement related to deprecated functionality. There is no indication of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
