  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, with a deprecation warning indicating the preferred import path. There are no input sources, data processing, or untrusted data sinks. The code itself does not perform any actions beyond importing, and the deprecation notice suggests maintenance rather than malicious intent. No unusual features, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
