  "purpose": "Import from a deprecated module, likely for code functionality that will be updated.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statement does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious activity is indicated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a deprecated module, with no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The use of 'import *' can be a maintenance concern but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The deprecation warning indicates a transition, not malicious activity. Scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score reflects minor concerns related to deprecation and broad import practices, but these are not security threats.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
