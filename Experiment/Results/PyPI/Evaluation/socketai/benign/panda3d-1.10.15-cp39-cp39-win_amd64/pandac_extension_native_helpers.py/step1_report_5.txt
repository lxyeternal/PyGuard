{
  "purpose": "Import functions or classes from a deprecated module in the 'direct' package, likely for use elsewhere in the code.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from direct.extensions_native.extension_native_helpers import *'",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions or classes could be sinks if they handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be determined solely from the import statement; it depends on how imported symbols are used later in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of a deprecated module may indicate outdated or unmaintained code, but does not inherently imply malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a deprecated module within 'direct.extensions_native'. This could suggest reliance on outdated code, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or classes are used later, but alone, it does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are evident. Since the code is only an import statement, it does not pose an immediate security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import from a deprecated module, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The main concern may be maintaining compatibility or updating to the recommended module, but nothing suspicious is present.",
