  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of such code",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only version declaration; no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string declaration for the Panda3D Python bindings. It contains no input handling, no data processing, no network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The minimal nature of this code suggests it is a simple metadata declaration without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a benign declaration of the package version.",
