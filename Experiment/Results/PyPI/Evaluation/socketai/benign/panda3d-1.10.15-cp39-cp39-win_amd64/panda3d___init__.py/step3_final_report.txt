  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Panda3D Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable, static string comment",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output, network, or data processing",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version string assignment with a descriptive comment. It contains no input, output, network activity, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No further analysis or adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
