  "purpose": "Provide Python bindings for the Panda3D libraries.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is sent or written out.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a version assignment; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single assignment statement setting the __version__ variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data fetching, or code execution. The simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest no malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior.",
