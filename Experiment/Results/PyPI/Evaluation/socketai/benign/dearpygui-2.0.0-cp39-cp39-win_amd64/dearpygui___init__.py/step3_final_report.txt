  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external data, inputs, or data flows; static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks due to simplicity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '2.0.0' to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or external dependencies are present. The code is minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. The logic is sound, and the scores are justified based on the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action needed.",
