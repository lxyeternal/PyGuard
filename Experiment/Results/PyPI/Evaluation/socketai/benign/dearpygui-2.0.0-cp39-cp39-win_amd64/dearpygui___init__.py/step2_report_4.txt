  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports describe a simple assignment of `'2.0.0'` to the variable `__version__`. The original code confirms this. No discrepancies or additional code are mentioned, and the reports consistently state that the code is straightforward and minimal.  \n**Conclusion:** The code matches the reports; no issues are present beyond the simple version assignment.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning.**  \n- The reports uniformly assert that this is a benign, standard practice with no malicious intent or security concerns.  \n- They correctly note the absence of input, external dependencies, data flows, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No logical errors are evident in their reasoning.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning appears sound and consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the code's simplicity.  \n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n- The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is harmless.  \n- The `purpose` and `analysis` descriptions are consistent with the code.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.  \n- No justification for higher scores is needed here.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the malware score.**  \n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**  \n- The reports assume that a simple version assignment is benign, which is correct.  \n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the reasoning is cautious and accurate.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content.**  \n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.  \n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign; all reports correctly identify it as a simple version string assignment. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
