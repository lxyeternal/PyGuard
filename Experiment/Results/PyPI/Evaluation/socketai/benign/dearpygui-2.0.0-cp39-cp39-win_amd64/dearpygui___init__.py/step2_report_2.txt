  "review": "Let's review the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a static string `'2.0.0'` to the variable `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. This is a standard pattern for package version declaration in Python.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and benign. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and contain no significant mistakes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is harmless, the `securityRisk` and `malware` scores are correctly set to 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated logic.  \n**Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign `malware: 0`. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.  \n**Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nThere are no claims of vulnerabilities or assumptions about vulnerabilities in the reports. The code is a simple version string assignment, a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a typical version declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is harmless and standard.",
