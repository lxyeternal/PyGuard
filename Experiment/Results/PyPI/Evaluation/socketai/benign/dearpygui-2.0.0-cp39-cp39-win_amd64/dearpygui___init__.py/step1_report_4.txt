  "anomalies": "Only a single version string assignment; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to the variable __version__. It does not perform any data input, processing, or output. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated logic. This is a typical version declaration used in Python packages.",
