  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code only performs a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '__version__' with value '2.0.0'. It is a common pattern in Python packages to specify version information. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. No input, no external dependencies, and no complex logic. It is a typical version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign and standard version declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
