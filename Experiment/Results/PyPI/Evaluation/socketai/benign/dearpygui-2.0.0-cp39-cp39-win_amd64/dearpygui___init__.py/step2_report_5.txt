  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns the string `'2.0.0'` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - No report indicates any malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or other security-sensitive operations.\n   - The simplicity and lack of complexity strongly suggest benign intent.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are present in the logic.\n   - The code is correctly implementing a standard version declaration.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, reflecting high certainty in benign nature.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is a simple version string assignment, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical, harmless version declaration.\n   - The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk associated with this code)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security concerns. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
