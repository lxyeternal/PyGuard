  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module or package as '2.0.0'.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a simple string assignment; no unusual patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. It does not perform any data input, output, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Given the simplicity, this is typical package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only a version assignment statement, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It appears safe and standard for package versioning.",
