  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string `'2.0.0'` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard, and harmless. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or overstatements are evident.\n   - **No corrections needed here.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence` = 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree there is no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security issues, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - **Therefore:** No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - **Confirmed:** Malware score is correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - The analysis is straightforward and based on the code snippet's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Workthrough conclusion:**  \nAll evidence points to this being a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated version assignment statement. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
