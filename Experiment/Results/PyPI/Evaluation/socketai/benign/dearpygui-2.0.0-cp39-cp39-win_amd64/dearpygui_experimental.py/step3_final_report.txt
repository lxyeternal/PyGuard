{
  "purpose": "This code imports the dearpygui library and its internal module, then defines a simple test function that prints a message. It appears to be a minimal GUI setup or test scaffold.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dearpygui.dearpygui and dearpygui._dearpygui",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network communication, or data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import of internal module (source) does not lead to any data flow or external effect; the test_function only prints locally",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of internal module dearpygui._dearpygui, which is not typical for standard usage but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing GUI libraries and defining a benign print function. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The internal module import is unusual but not suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The minimal nature and benign behavior justify a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score primarily due to the internal module import, which is not inherently harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The import of an internal module is noted but does not constitute a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
