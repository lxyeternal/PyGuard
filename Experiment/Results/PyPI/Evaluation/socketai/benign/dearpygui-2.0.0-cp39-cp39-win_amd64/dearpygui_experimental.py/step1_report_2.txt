  "purpose": "The code appears to set up an experimental user interface using the Dear PyGui library, with a simple test function defined.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dearpygui modules, function definition for test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; the function test_function only prints to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The script imports two modules related to Dear PyGui, likely for GUI development. It defines a simple function that outputs a print statement. There are no network communications, data handling, or potentially malicious operations. The code appears to be for GUI testing or setup. No unusual patterns or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for a GUI interface with a simple test function; no malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
