{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a user interface using the Dear PyGui library, primarily for UI creation and interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing dearpygui modules, specifically 'dearpygui.dearpygui' and internal '_dearpygui'.",
  "sinks": "The only function defined is 'test_function' which prints to the console. No data sinks or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink flow is observed beyond the import of libraries and the simple print statement in the function.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'dearpygui._dearpygui' (an internal module) might be unusual, but does not inherently imply malicious intent. No other suspicious or malicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GUI libraries and defines a single test function that outputs a message. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks for data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution. The inclusion of internal modules is uncommon but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and lacks any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup for a Dear PyGui interface with a test function. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The use of internal modules is noted but not suspicious enough to flag as malicious.",
