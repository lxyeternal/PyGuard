  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, the reasoning behind the scores, and consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal setup for Dear PyGui, primarily importing modules and defining a simple print function.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The import of `dearpygui._dearpygui` (an internal module) is noted as unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), consistent with the benign assessment.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers are confident in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and matches the description.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Use of internal modules:** Unusual but not suspicious in this context.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):** Justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk (~0.1):** Slightly elevated due to internal module import, but not enough to flag as a real risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable considering the internal module import)\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports correctly identify this as benign code with no malicious intent. The minor concern about internal module import does not translate into a security risk here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0 — no malicious activity detected                               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0 — code is straightforward                                       |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 — minimal concern due to internal module import             |\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign assessment provided by the reports.",
