{
  "purpose": "To create a simple user interface using Dear PyGui for experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code imports libraries but does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output actions that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a function and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules related to Dear PyGui, a Python GUI library. It defines a single function 'test_function' that prints a message. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or other suspicious activities. The import of 'internal_dpg' might be for advanced or internal use, but this alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign, designed for GUI purposes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for a GUI with a test function. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
