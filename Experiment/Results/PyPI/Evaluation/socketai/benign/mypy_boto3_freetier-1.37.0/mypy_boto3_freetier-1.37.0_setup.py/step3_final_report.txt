  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-freetier' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging, importing only necessary modules, reading a local file for description, and calling 'setup()' with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis, indicating high confidence in its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign Python packaging configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward structure.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
