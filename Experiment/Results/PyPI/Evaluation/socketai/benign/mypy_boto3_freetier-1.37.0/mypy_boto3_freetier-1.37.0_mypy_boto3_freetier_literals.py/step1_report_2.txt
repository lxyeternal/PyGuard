  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service and resource names used in type annotations for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and conditional import of Literal; type alias definitions using Literal with fixed string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data flow from untrusted inputs to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines static string literals; no data flow involving untrusted inputs or dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The import conditional based on Python version is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check Python version compatibility for importing Literal, a standard pattern. It then defines several type aliases as string Literal types, representing AWS service and resource names, as well as operation identifiers. There are no functions, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be providing accurate type hints for static analysis and code assistance, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type alias definitions for static type checking, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no dynamic code, no data leaks, or security risks.",
