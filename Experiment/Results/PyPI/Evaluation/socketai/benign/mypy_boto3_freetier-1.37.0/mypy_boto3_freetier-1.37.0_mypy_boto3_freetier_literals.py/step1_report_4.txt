  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and typing modules, and the definitions of Literal types for AWS services and options.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code primarily sets up type aliases.",
  "flows": "N/A - static type definitions with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal types for AWS service names and options, which are used for type annotations. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources involved. No potential entry points, sinks, or flows that could carry malicious data. No obfuscation, no backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard type annotation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is purely for defining type aliases for AWS service identifiers and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe code segment intended for type checking support.",
