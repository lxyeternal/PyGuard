{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literals used in AWS service and resource identifiers to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read external input or produce output, serving solely as type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static type alias assignments with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with standard conditional import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, and options. It uses conditional import for compatibility, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.0, reflecting the benign and static nature of the module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for static type annotations with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose, and the assigned scores are justified. The overall security posture is neutral, with no concerns.",
