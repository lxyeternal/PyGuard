  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service components and parameters for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading type annotations for service names, resource names, and parameter options; importing 'sys' and conditionally importing 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data input, output, or handling points present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is primarily type annotation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs conditional import for compatibility and defines constants for literals.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases for AWS service-related string literals, using conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from external inputs is present. It serves as a static type definition module. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of 'sys' for version checking is standard and benign. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS service constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for type safety and documentation purposes.",
