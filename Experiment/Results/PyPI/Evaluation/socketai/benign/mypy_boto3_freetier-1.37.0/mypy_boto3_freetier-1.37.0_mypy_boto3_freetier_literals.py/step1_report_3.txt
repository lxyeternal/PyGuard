  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service identifiers used in type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal, definitions of Literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code only defines type aliases and imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward type alias definitions with no dynamic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version and then defines several type alias literals for AWS services and options. There are no inputs, data processing, network operations, or execution of untrusted code. The purpose is purely static type hinting and documentation support. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. The code does not handle user input or perform any actions beyond type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type hinting purposes, defining string literal types for use in documentation and type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It is a benign, well-structured utility module for static typing support.",
