  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the freetier service module for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing, and the definitions of Literal type annotations for different categories of string constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external outputs, or data flows from untrusted sources are present. The code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases for use in other modules. No external data inputs, user inputs, or data manipulations are present. There are no side effects, network operations, or code execution. The purpose is purely to specify type-safe string constants. All elements are standard, well-documented, and serve as type annotations for a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe type annotation module defining string literal types for use elsewhere. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
