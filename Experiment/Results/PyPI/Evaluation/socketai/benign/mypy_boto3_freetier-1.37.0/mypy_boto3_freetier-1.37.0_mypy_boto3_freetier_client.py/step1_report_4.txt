  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the FreeTier service client in boto3, enabling type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; properties and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines classes and method signatures without data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard type annotations and class structure for a boto3 client.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for a boto3 client for the 'freetier' service. It imports standard modules, conditionally imports based on Python version, and defines exceptions and a client class with documented methods. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The implementation seems straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for boto3 stub clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation and interface definition for a boto3 client. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected. It functions solely as a type and interface definition without executable logic that could be exploited.",
