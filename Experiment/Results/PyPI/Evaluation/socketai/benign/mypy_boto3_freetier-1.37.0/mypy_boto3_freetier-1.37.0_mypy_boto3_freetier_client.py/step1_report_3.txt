  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the 'freetier' AWS service, facilitating interaction with the service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property declarations, especially the use of kwargs unpacking for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data in method parameters such as 'Params' and 'kwargs' for API calls, which could influence URL generation or API requests.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments flows into API request generation functions, including generate_presigned_url and get_free_tier_usage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Unpack' for kwargs, which is standard in boto3 stubs, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is mainly type annotations and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 client class for AWS 'freetier'. It defines exception types, client properties, and methods that interact with AWS services. No execution logic or malicious code present. The use of 'kwargs' in get_free_tier_usage is typical for API request parameterization. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is a straightforward API stub interface with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious type annotation and client class for AWS boto3 SDK. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is a typical stub with no suspicious or harmful features.",
