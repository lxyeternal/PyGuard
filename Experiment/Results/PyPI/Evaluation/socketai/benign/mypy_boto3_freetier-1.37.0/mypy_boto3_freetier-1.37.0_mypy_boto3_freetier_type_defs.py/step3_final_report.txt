  "purpose": "Type annotations for the freetier service type definitions, serving as static type hints and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static type definitions and version-dependent imports; no untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to external systems or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only defines data structures without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or network communication. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate benign, standard code for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard static type definition module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves its purpose for type hinting in the boto3-stubs project without any indications of compromise.",
