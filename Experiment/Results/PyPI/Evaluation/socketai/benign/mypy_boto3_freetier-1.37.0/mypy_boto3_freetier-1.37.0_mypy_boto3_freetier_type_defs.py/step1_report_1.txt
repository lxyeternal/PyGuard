  "purpose": "Type annotations and definitions for the freetier service in the boto3-stubs project, used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from sys.version_info, imports from typing, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions, and local literals. Defines TypedDict classes and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations detected. No network, file, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and annotations do not involve data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of version-dependent imports and type definitions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional imports based on Python version, and type definitions for data structures related to the freetier service. All imports are standard for type hinting and compatibility, with no code execution, user input handling, or external communication. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a well-structured, static type annotation module intended for static analysis and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains safe, standard type annotation code for the freetier service's data structures. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is purely for type hinting and documentation purposes, with no active or harmful behavior.",
