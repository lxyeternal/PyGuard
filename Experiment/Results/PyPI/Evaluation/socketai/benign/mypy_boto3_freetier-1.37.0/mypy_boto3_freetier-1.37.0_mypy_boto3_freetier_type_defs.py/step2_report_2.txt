  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a collection of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- There are no runtime operations, external data handling, network calls, or user input processing.\n- The code is well-structured, standard for type annotations, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, serving solely for static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for type annotations and contains no active logic or data processing. There are no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **No flaws detected:** The reports' reasoning aligns with the code's static nature. They correctly interpret the conditional imports, type definitions, and lack of data flow or external interactions.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, reflecting no security risk.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not process untrusted input, does not perform network or file operations, and does not contain any code that could be exploited.\n- The use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility, not malicious.\n- The purpose is static type annotations, which inherently do not pose security risks.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" or \"signs of malicious intent,\" but these are unfounded given the static, type-only nature of the code.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious payloads are supported by the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is purely for static type annotations, with no active or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.",
