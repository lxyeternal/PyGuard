  "purpose": "Type annotations and definitions for the freetier service, providing structured data types for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, and the class definitions with TypedDict and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures and does not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code defines data types without runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; the code is focused on type definitions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. It defines multiple TypedDict classes for structured API data, including optional fields using NotRequired. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution is present. The code is straightforward, primarily for type hinting and documentation purposes. It contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client related to the freetier service. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The structure and content are consistent with standard type annotations and data modeling practices. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
