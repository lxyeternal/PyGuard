  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the 'freetier' service in boto3, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, including sys.version_info checks, and class definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sink of untrusted data or external data flows; code primarily defines data types and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. Use of 'sys.version_info' is for compatibility and not malicious. No external data being fetched or transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions using TypedDict for structured data modeling, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. The code adheres to standard practices for type annotations and does not include any network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and the code is purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions for a Python AWS SDK service. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate type checking and documentation for the 'freetier' service data structures.",
