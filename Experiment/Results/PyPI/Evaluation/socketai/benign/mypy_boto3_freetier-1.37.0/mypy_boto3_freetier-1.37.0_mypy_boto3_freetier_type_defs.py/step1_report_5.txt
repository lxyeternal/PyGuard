  "purpose": "Type annotations and type definitions for the freetier service, used for static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, only imports type definitions, and uses static type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code defines data structures for API requests and responses.",
  "flows": "N/A – static type definitions without runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is purely type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party type modules, defines TypedDict data structures for API request/response schemas, and includes no executable or runtime code that could be malicious. There are no functions executing external commands, network requests, or handling untrusted input. All code appears to serve as static type annotations for the API schemas, with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for static type annotation purposes, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present. It simply defines data structures for API communication, with no runtime logic or external data processing.",
