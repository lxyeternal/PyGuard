  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the freetier service, used for type checking and API schema validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and data structure definitions, primarily reading sys.version_info, builtins, and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external input; code only defines types and constants.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is declarative for type hints and documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code is consistent with type definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines type annotations conditionally based on Python version, and declares various TypedDict classes representing data structures. It uses version checks to adapt imports, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, no external calls, or data manipulation is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions and documentation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a static type schema for the freetier service. No malware or security concerns are identified.",
