{
  "purpose": "Define and store the version information of the package.",
  "sources": "The line assigning '__version__' retrieves the version string, which is hardcoded in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being sent or processed externally.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is a future year, but this is not malicious. The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a version string for a package. It contains a copyright comment with a future year but no dynamic code, input, or external data handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a standard version declaration, with no complex logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or oversight but not harmful.",
