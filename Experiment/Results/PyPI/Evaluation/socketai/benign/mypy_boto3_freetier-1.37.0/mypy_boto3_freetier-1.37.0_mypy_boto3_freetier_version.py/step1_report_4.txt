  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright statement, a version string, and a straightforward assignment to the __version__ variable. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. The version number is hardcoded, which is standard practice. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code elements are present.",
