  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a simple, static assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n   - It includes only a comment with a copyright notice, which has a future year (2025). This is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code, input/output operations, or external data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a common purpose: defining a version string.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - No report suggests any anomaly beyond the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Clarifications**:\n   - The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025\" — future year, likely a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.\n   - No reason to adjust scores or suspect malicious activity based on the provided code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the scores as they are. No changes needed.",
