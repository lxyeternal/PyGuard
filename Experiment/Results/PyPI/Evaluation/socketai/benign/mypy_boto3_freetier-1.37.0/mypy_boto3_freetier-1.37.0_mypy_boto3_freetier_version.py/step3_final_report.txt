  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025', likely a typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static version declaration with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only anomaly is the future year, which is benign and likely a typo. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The high confidence score reflects certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
