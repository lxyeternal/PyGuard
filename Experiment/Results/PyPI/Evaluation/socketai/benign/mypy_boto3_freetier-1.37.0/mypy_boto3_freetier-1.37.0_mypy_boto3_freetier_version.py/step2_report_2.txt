  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The copyright year is in the future (2025), which might be a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data processing, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n- No untrusted data, no data flows, no external interactions.\n- No anomalies other than the future year, which is benign.\n- The analysis and conclusions in all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** correctly 0, as the code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk score:** all are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of security issues.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025\". While this is likely a typo or oversight, it does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n- No reason to adjust scores upward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not harmful.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are correct; no changes needed.",
