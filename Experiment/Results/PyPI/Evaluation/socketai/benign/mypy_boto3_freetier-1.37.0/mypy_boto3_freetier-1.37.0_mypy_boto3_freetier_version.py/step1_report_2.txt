  "anomalies": "Minimal; the only notable point is the version string and the copyright comment, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string with a copyright comment. There are no inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code serves as a static source of truth for the package version. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard purpose of setting a version variable with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
