  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output to stdout, no data from untrusted sources flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Code is straightforward and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines simple functions for printing package info and version, and a main function that triggers based on command-line arguments. No external data fetching, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The only input is command-line arguments, which are safely handled. The code appears benign and intended for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info and version, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
