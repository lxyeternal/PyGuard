  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; potential for data leaks if inputs are untrusted, but here it is limited to static strings",
  "flows": "User input (--version argument) triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs static package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; the code solely outputs static, informational strings",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for CLI argument parsing and output. It defines functions to output static package info and version. The main function checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to display. The outputs are fixed strings, and there are no external data sources or dynamic inputs that could be malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for informational purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package information and version details. No malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or security risks are detected. It is a benign informational script.",
