{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "stdout (sys.stdout.write) for outputting package info and version",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() output, all other cases trigger print_info() output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no external data fetching, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv to determine whether to print version information or package info. It writes output to stdout. The functions are straightforward with no external calls, no data leaks, or unsafe behaviors. No code injection, no credential handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The license and copyright comment are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that provides static package information and version details. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
