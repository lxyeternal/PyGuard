  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs data)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') -> print_version or print_info output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides package info and version details via command-line interface. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to display version info or package details. All output is directed to standard output. No external network calls, data collection, or suspicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The copyright date is in the future but does not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code. It functions solely as an informational script.",
