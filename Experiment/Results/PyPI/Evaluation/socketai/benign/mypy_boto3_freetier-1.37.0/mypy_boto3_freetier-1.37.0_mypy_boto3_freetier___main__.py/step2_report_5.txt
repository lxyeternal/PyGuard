  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or external data fetching.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The functions only output static strings based on command-line arguments.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is benign and serves an informational purpose.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and safe.\n- They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The analysis is accurate; no issues are missed or misinterpreted.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues:**\n- All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports assign 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, and the code is clearly benign, no justification for higher scores exists.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code is purely informational, with no malicious intent.\n- No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's actual behavior.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information.\n- No dynamic or external data, no network activity, no code obfuscation.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall security risk of this code is negligible. It is a benign, informational script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- Final estimated scores: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0**.",
