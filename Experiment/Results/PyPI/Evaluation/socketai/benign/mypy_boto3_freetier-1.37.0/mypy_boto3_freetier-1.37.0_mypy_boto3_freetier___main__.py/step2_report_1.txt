  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info and version details.\n   - It processes command-line arguments to decide what to display (`--version` triggers version info; otherwise, package info).\n   - No external data fetching, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - No credentials, secrets, or sensitive data embedded.\n   - The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is simple, benign, and typical for CLI utilities.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely informational.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.",
