  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output display",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments -> conditional checks -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward information display",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple CLI commands to display package info and version. It uses sys.argv to determine whether to print version info or package details. There are no external data inputs besides command-line args, and outputs are to stdout. No network activity, file operations, or external data processing is present. No obfuscated code, no suspicious functions, no potential for data leakage or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script designed solely for informational output. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risks.",
