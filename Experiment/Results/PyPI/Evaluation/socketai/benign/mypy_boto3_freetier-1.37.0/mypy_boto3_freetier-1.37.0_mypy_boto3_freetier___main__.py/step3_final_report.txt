{
  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout based on command-line input; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() outputs static info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with a future copyright year (2025) but no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. It processes command-line arguments safely, with no external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. No credentials, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear and benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safety, and the scoring aligns with its simple, static nature. No modifications are necessary.",
