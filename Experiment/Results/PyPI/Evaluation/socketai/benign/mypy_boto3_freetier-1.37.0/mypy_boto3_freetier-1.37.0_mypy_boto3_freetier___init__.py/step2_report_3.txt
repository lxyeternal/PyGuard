  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local modules, creates an alias, and defines `__all__`.\n- The documentation provides usage examples but contains no executable logic.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or processing are present.\n- The only noted anomalies are the placeholder future year \"2025\" in the copyright and documentation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, straightforward code, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note on the future year.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) due to the future year, but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable, given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero only in Report 4, justified by the future date anomaly, but not indicating any security threat.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The only minor concern is the future year, which is unlikely to pose any security risk but could be flagged as a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — due to the future date, but not a security concern.\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the evidence. No further action or re-scoring needed.",
