{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for interacting with the 'freetier' service, including importing relevant classes and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator); code comments and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of client objects; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in 2025, which is a future year, unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module interface that imports classes and functions, documents usage, and sets export variables. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or code execution logic. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. The comments and structure are straightforward and typical for SDK interface modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface wrapper with no malicious or security risks detected.",
