  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the reported findings, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local modules, assigns an alias, and defines `__all__`.\n- The documentation includes usage examples and references, but no actual runtime logic or data processing.\n- No external data, user input, network calls, or sensitive operations are present.\n- The only anomalies noted are placeholder or future-looking copyright years (2025), which are benign and likely placeholders.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no issues found.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9) in benignity; notes the future year (2025) as an anomaly but benign.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1, justified as a benign placeholder anomaly.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, justified by the placeholder future date, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only point of note is the future year (2025), which could be flagged as a placeholder but not a security concern.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the placeholder date, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, straightforward interface module with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
