  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local modules, sets an alias, and defines `__all__`.\n- The documentation includes usage examples and references, with no runtime logic.\n- The only noted anomalies are placeholder links and a future copyright year (2025).\n- No external data, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; benign interface code, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Also a simple interface module, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Similar benign code, with a note on the future year (2025). This is an anomaly but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The future date is slightly unusual but does not pose a security risk. It's more of a placeholder or typo.\n- **Verdict:** The score is acceptable, though perhaps a bit high. A value of 0.05 might be more precise, but 0.1 is still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with Report 4 at 0.1 due to the future date anomaly.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board.\n- **Risk:** Given the consistent benign code, I would assign a **risk score of 0** for all reports, including Report 4, since the only anomaly (future date) is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious interface module.\n- The scores are generally accurate; the only minor point is the future year, which warrants a very low risk score (e.g., 0.05), but 0.1 is acceptable.\n- No changes needed; the reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All reports are accurate; the scores are appropriate, with a slight note that the risk score for Report 4 could be marginally lowered.",
