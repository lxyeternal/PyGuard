{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the 'freetier' service, importing client classes and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static and import-based.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the copyright and documentation, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules, defines an alias, and sets __all__. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity. The only anomaly is the future year '2025', which is benign and likely a placeholder. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The documentation and structure are typical for an SDK or API interface module, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only notable point is the placeholder future year, which does not pose any security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1 due to the placeholder anomaly. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
