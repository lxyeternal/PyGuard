{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'zxcvbn' Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; static setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> configuring setup parameters -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behaviors; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setuptools setup script that reads a README file for long description and defines package metadata and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or external network interactions. The script only performs static configuration for package distribution without processing untrusted input or executing potentially malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
