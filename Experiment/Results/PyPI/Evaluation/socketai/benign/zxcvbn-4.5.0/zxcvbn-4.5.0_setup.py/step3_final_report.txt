  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, URLs, classifiers, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description; static package metadata; CLI entry point 'zxcvbn.__main__:cli'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from local files and static strings into setup() call; no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README file and defines package metadata, URLs, classifiers, and an entry point for CLI. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or processing of untrusted input. The CLI entry point points to 'zxcvbn.__main__:cli', which could invoke malicious code if implemented maliciously, but this cannot be determined from the setup script alone. The script itself is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The potential risk associated with the CLI entry point depends on the implementation of 'cli', which is outside the scope of this script. Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
