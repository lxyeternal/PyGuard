{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'zxcvbn', intended to prepare the package for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description; reads package metadata; reads data from setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink detected; the script only configures package metadata and entry points.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for description; supplies static package metadata; defines console entry point that executes 'zxcvbn.__main__:cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The entry point points to a CLI script, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads a README file for description content. It then calls setup() with static metadata, package information, URLs, and classifiers. The entry point defines a CLI command 'zxcvbn' linked to a function in the package. All code is standard for package setup; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used, and no code indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration.",
