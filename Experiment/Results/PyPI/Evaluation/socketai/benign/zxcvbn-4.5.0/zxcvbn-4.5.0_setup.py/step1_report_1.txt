{
  "purpose": "To set up the Python package 'zxcvbn' for distribution, including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description; no other external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the setup configuration; no external data flows or untrusted inputs processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file to include as long_description, then calls setup() with package metadata, URLs, author info, classifiers, and console script entry point. No dynamic code execution, no input validation issues, and no external data processing beyond reading a local file. The setup script follows standard practices and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs standard package setup procedures without any security risks.",
