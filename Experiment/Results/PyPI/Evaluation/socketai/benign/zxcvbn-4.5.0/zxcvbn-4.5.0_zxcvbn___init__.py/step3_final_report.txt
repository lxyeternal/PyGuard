  "purpose": "A password strength estimator function named zxcvbn that validates password length, sanitizes user inputs, performs matching and scoring, estimates attack times, and provides feedback.",
  "sources": "User inputs (password and user data), imported modules (matching, scoring, time_estimates, feedback)",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications; internal data processing only",
  "flows": "Input data flows through sanitization to matching, scoring, attack time estimation, and feedback modules, then results are assembled and returned",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for Python 2/3 string compatibility, which is standard legacy support; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard password strength estimation with input validation, sanitization, and modular processing. No malicious behavior, external network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The legacy Python 2 compatibility code is benign. External modules are presumed reputable. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward password strength estimator with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores of 0 are justified. The existing assessments are accurate and consistent.",
