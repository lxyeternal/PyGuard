{
  "purpose": "The function zxcvbn evaluates the strength of a given password using various matching, scoring, and feedback modules.",
  "sources": "User inputs (password and optional user inputs), data from imported modules (matching, scoring, time_estimates, feedback)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network, no sensitive data is leaked outside the function.",
  "flows": "User inputs are processed and used within the function for matching and scoring, but all data remains internal; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious code patterns. Use of deprecated 'unicode' in Python 2 detection is benign, but suggests legacy support.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes password strength assessment through local module functions. It includes input validation and sanitization, timing measurement, and structured output. No external network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard password strength evaluation function with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate component of a password validation library.",
