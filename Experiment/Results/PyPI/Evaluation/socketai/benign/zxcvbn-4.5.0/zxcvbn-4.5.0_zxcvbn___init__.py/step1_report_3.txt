  "purpose": "The function zxcvbn evaluates the strength of a given password using various matching and scoring techniques, and provides feedback along with attack time estimates.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'password' and 'user_inputs', and internally accesses data from matching, scoring, time_estimates, and feedback modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions; no network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs are sanitized, processed through matching and scoring modules, then attack times are estimated, and feedback is generated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of 'try-except' for Python 2/3 compatibility is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs password analysis by validating length, sanitizing user inputs, and utilizing external modules for matching and scoring. It measures processing time and adds attack estimates and feedback to the result. No network activity, file manipulation, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate password strength evaluation function without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
