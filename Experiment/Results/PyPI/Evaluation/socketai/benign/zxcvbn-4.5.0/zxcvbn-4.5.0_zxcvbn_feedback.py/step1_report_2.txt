{
  "purpose": "Provides feedback on password strength and patterns based on analysis of password sequences and matches.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'score' and 'sequence'; imported modules 'zxcvbn.scoring' and 'gettext'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly processes data internally and provides feedback messages.",
  "flows": "Processes 'sequence' to generate feedback; analyzes 'match' dictionaries for pattern warnings and suggestions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a password strength feedback mechanism. It imports language strings for user messages and analyzes password patterns and matches to generate warnings and suggestions. There are no signs of malicious data transmission, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code only manipulates data to produce user feedback and does not interact with external systems beyond string localization. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate password feedback tool using pattern analysis. There is no indication of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security risks within this module.",
