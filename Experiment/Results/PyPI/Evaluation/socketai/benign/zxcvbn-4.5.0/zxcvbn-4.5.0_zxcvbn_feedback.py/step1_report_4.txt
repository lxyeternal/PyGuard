{
  "purpose": "The code provides feedback on password strength by analyzing password patterns, matches, and common weaknesses to guide users in creating stronger passwords.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'score' and 'sequence', and data within 'match' objects like 'pattern', 'dictionary_name', 'token', etc.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input in a harmful way; mainly generates textual feedback.",
  "flows": "Input data (score, sequence, match objects) flows into various functions which generate warnings and suggestions based on password analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code is mainly pattern matching and text generation based on password analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching and feedback generation for password strength assessment, including dictionary, spatial, repeat, sequence, regex, and date patterns. It uses regular expressions and string pattern checks. No external network access or system modification code is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its sole purpose is to provide password security advice based on known weak patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign password feedback module, primarily used for security guidance without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or malicious data leakage. It is safe for use.",
