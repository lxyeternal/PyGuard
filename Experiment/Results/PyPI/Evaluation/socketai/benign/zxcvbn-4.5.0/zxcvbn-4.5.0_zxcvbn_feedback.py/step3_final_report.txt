{
  "purpose": "Provides password strength feedback based on pattern matching and user guidance.",
  "sources": "Pattern match results, token strings, regex and dictionary match data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted external data beyond internal pattern analysis.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are analyzed for patterns; feedback is generated based on match types and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward pattern matching and feedback generation with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes password patterns such as dictionary words, spatial patterns, repeats, sequences, regex matches, and dates. It generates warnings and suggestions accordingly. It only processes data internally, with no external network, file, or environment interactions. The imported constants and functions are standard, and the logic is clear and well-structured. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign password feedback utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
