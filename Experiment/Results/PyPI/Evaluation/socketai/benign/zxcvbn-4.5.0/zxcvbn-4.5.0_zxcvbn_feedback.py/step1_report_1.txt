{
  "purpose": "This code provides feedback and suggestions for password strength evaluation based on pattern matching and dictionary checks.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'sequence' parameter, which contains match objects, and from imported modules ('zxcvbn.scoring' and 'gettext').",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network or file operations; data flows are internal and mostly involve returning dictionaries with warnings and suggestions.",
  "flows": "Input data (sequence of matches) flows through conditional checks to produce warnings and suggestions based on pattern types and match properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functions. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes password patterns like dictionary words, spatial patterns, repeats, sequences, regex, and dates, providing user feedback. It relies on imported constants and functions for pattern detection. No external or untrusted data sources are accessed. The logic is straightforward, mainly conditional checks and string manipulations. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate password feedback module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for providing password strength guidance without performing any harmful operations.",
