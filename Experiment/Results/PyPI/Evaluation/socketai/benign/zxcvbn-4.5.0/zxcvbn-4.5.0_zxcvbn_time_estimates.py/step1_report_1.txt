{
  "purpose": "The code estimates password attack times and provides a crack time score and human-readable duration descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input: 'guesses' parameter in estimate_attack_times function; internal data conversions in float_to_decimal function.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data is sent over network, stored, or used in unsafe system calls.",
  "flows": "Input guesses → converted via guesses_to_score and float_to_decimal → displayed as crack times and durations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of decimal contexts and repeated adjustment of precision in float_to_decimal; no malicious intent apparent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs calculations to estimate password strength and crack times based on guesses. It uses Decimal for precise floating-point conversions, with a custom float_to_decimal function that ensures no data loss. The functions are straightforward, with no network operations, file access, or environment variable usage. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The logic appears benign and typical for a password strength estimator. The only unconventional part is the dynamic adjustment of decimal precision, which is a standard approach for accurate decimal conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for estimating password strength and crack times with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard cryptographic assumptions and calculation methods. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
