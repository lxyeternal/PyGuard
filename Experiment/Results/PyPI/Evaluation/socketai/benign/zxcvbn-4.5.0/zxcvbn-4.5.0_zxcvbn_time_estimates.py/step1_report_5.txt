{
  "purpose": "The code estimates password attack times based on guesses, converting these estimates into human-readable formats and scoring password strength.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'guesses' in estimate_attack_times and guesses_to_score functions; 'f' in float_to_decimal function.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems, files, or network. No data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The 'guesses' input flows into calculations for crack times, then into display functions and scoring logic. 'float_to_decimal' converts floats for precise arithmetic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom float to decimal conversion with a loop checking 'Inexact' flags is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs password strength estimation based on guesses, with conversions for precise calculations and human-readable formatting. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The floating point to decimal conversion is elaborate but appears to serve precision needs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic identified. The code's structure and logic are consistent with legitimate password strength estimation tasks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and focused on estimating password attack times and scoring password strength. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected. It functions solely within the scope of password security assessment.",
