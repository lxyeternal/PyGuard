{
  "purpose": "The code estimates password attack times and scores the guess count based on security strength metrics.",
  "sources": "The function guesses_to_score reads the 'guesses' parameter; the function estimate_attack_times takes 'guesses' as input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, nor does it execute untrusted input as code or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The 'guesses' input flows into calculations for attack time estimations and scoring; no external data flow or output manipulation detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The float_to_decimal function performs precise decimal conversion but does not perform any suspicious conversions or obfuscations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides password security estimations through calculations based on input 'guesses'. It converts float guesses to Decimal accurately, avoiding loss of information, and then computes estimated attack times across various scenarios. The scoring function categorizes guesses into different security levels. The display_time function converts seconds into human-readable formats, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to password strength assessment. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious code execution was observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate password strength estimation utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It performs calculations and data formatting only, with no suspicious side effects or hidden behaviors.",
