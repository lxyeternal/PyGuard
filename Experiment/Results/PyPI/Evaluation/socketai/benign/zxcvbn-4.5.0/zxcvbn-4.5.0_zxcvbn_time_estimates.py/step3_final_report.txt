  "purpose": "Estimate password attack times based on guesses, convert guesses into various attack scenarios, categorize password strength, and display human-readable crack times.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'guesses' used in calculations; internal functions 'float_to_decimal' and 'display_time' process data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file operations; data processed internally only.",
  "flows": "Guesses are converted to Decimal via 'float_to_decimal', then used to compute crack times; results are formatted and scored within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional 'float_to_decimal' function adjusts decimal precision dynamically based on 'Inexact' flag, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs password strength estimation through calculations of crack times across different attack scenarios, using high-precision Decimal conversions. The 'float_to_decimal' function's loop ensures no data loss during float to Decimal conversion, albeit in an unconventional manner. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The scoring thresholds are reasonable, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. The overall structure is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password strength utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only unusual aspect is the high-precision float-to-decimal conversion, which is a safe, technical choice rather than malicious sabotage.",
