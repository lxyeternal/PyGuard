{
  "purpose": "The code estimates password attack times and provides a score based on guess difficulty, mainly for password strength assessment.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'guesses' parameter provided to estimate_attack_times function, which is used to compute crack times and scores.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, network, or files; it only processes numerical data internally.",
  "flows": "Input 'guesses' flows into calculations for crack times, which are then converted into display strings; no external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The function float_to_decimal employs a custom conversion of float to Decimal with a loop adjusting precision based on Inexact flag, which is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on calculating password crack times and categorizing password strength based on guesses. It uses Decimal for high-precision arithmetic, particularly converting float guesses into Decimal. The float_to_decimal function employs a loop that increases precision if inexact flags are set, which is an unusual but legitimate approach for high-precision conversion. No network access, system modifications, or malicious intent evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The logic appears consistent with password strength estimation without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs password strength assessment based on guesses without any malicious or suspicious activities. It uses unconventional but safe high-precision float-to-decimal conversion, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
