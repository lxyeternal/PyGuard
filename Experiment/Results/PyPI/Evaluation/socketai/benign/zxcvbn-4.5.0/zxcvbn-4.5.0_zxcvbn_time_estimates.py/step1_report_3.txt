{
  "purpose": "The code estimates password attack times based on the number of guesses and categorizes password strength accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'guesses' in 'estimate_attack_times' function.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'guesses' in calculations and converts floating point to Decimal; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Guesses are converted and processed through calculations, conversions, and display functions; no external network or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom float-to-decimal conversion with a loop adjusting precision is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs password strength estimation based on guess counts. It converts floating point guesses to Decimal using a custom function to maintain precision, adjusting context precision dynamically. The attack time estimates are calculated for different attack scenarios, and the results are formatted into human-readable strings. No external data sources, network activities, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code relies solely on mathematical calculations and display formatting. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of password strength estimation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices and only performs mathematical and formatting operations without external dependencies or harmful activities.",
