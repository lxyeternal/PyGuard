{
  "purpose": "This code defines adjacency graphs for different keyboard layouts, likely used for key mapping or layout analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from hardcoded dictionaries for various keyboard layouts: 'qwerty', 'dvorak', 'keypad', 'mac_keypad'. No external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, as indicated by the comment. It contains extensive, static data structures without any dynamic execution or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data structure defining adjacency mappings for various keyboard layouts. It is generated by an external script ('scripts/build_keyboard_adjacency_graphs.py') and contains no runtime logic, external inputs, or outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malware indicators. The data seems intended for keyboard layout analysis or related processing.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, auto-generated static data structure for keyboard adjacency graphs. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
