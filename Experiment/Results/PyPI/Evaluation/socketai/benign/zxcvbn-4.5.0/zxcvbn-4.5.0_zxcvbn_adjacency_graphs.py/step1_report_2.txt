{
  "purpose": "Defines adjacency graphs for keyboard layouts (QWERTY, Dvorak, keypad, mac keypad) used for key mapping or layout analysis.",
  "sources": "Data structures initialized with keyboard layout mappings; no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or external communications present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data initialization only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a static configuration generated by a script (build_keyboard_adjacency_graphs.py).",
  "analysis": "The code contains dictionaries defining adjacency relationships between keys for various keyboard layouts. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The comment indicates this was generated by an external script, suggesting it's a configuration or data file. The structure and content are consistent with typical keyboard adjacency mappings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static data structure representing keyboard adjacency graphs. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a generated configuration file for layout mapping purposes.",
