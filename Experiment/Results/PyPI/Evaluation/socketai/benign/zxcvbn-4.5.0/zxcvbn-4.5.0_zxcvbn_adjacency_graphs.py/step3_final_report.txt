  "purpose": "Static data structure defining keyboard adjacency graphs for various layouts, generated by a script for layout analysis or key mapping.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the static dictionary definitions for each keyboard layout, which are hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static data without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, generated static data with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large, static dictionary defining adjacency relationships for multiple keyboard layouts. It is generated by an external script, indicating it is configuration data. There are no dynamic elements, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The code does not perform any operations or contain malicious payloads. All signals point to a benign, static resource used for layout mapping. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration data structure with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
