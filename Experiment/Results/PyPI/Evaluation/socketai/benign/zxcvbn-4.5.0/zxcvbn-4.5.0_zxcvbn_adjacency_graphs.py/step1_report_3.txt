  "purpose": "Definition of adjacency graphs for different keyboard layouts, likely for input mapping or processing.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading points; static data structure definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; purely static data assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static initialization only.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an automatically generated comment, but no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines large, static dictionaries representing adjacency relationships for various keyboard layouts ('qwerty', 'dvorak', 'keypad', 'mac_keypad'). The data appears to be generated by a script ('build_keyboard_adjacency_graphs.py'), as indicated by the comment. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or network operations present. The structure is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious activity. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The primary purpose seems to be input mapping or layout configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data structure defining keyboard adjacency graphs, generated by a script. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a benign configuration resource.",
