{
  "purpose": "The code defines adjacency mappings for different keyboard layouts, likely used for keyboard adjacency or layout processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures initialized with keyboard adjacency mappings at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external communication occurs within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal to the static data definitions; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be purely data definitions for keyboard layouts.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static dictionary definitions for different keyboard layouts ('qwerty', 'dvorak', 'keypad', 'mac_keypad'), mapping characters to their neighboring keys. There are no functions, input handling, or external calls. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be intended for use in keyboard layout processing or similar applications, with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as static configuration data for keyboard adjacency mappings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
