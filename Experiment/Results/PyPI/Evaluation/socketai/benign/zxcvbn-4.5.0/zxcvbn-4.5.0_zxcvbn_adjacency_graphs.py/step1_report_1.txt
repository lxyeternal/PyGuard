{
  "purpose": "The code defines adjacency graphs for different keyboard layouts (QWERTY, Dvorak, keypad, mac keypad), likely used for keyboard adjacency or layout analysis.",
  "sources": "The code is a static data structure with no external input reading or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Since there are no input or output operations, there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large, complex, hard-coded dictionary without dynamic or obfuscated elements. No hidden or suspicious functions or code segments are present. The comment indicates it is generated by a script, suggesting an automated and benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static data structure representing adjacency mappings for different keyboard layouts. No code injection, malicious network activity, or system manipulation is evident. The structure appears to be used for layout analysis or key adjacency purposes. No suspicious patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leakage are present. The code is well-formed and contains only data definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static configuration or data dictionary generated by a script, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
