      "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The potential risk associated with the CLI entry point depends on the implementation of 'cli', which is outside the scope of this script. Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malware or security risks."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external libraries and input data. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, which correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score should remain 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate."
