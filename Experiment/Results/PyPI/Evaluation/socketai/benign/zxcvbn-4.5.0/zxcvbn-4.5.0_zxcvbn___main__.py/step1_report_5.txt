  "purpose": "A command-line tool for estimating password strength using Dropbox's zxcvbn algorithm, with optional user data inputs.",
  "sources": "Reads password input from stdin or via getpass, and optional user data from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The password is passed to the zxcvbn function; the result is serialized to stdout as JSON.",
  "flows": "Input from stdin or getpass -> passed to zxcvbn -> JSON output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. Usage of select and getpass for password input is standard. No suspicious data leakage or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user password input either via stdin or interactively via getpass. It also accepts optional user data to enhance password strength estimation. The password is processed by the zxcvbn library, which is a known open-source password strength estimator, and results are output as JSON. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure appears standard and straightforward. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code primarily performs input collection, passes data to a trusted external library, and outputs results, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line utility for password strength estimation. It does not contain malware or security risks. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
