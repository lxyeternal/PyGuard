  "purpose": "A command-line tool for estimating password strength using Dropbox's zxcvbn implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from stdin and command-line arguments; uses getpass to read passwords securely.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON-encoded results to stdout.",
  "flows": "Password is read from stdin or via getpass, then passed to zxcvbn for analysis, and results are output as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a CLI wrapper around the zxcvbn password strength estimator. It accepts user inputs and passwords, then outputs the analysis result. It uses standard Python libraries (argparse, json, select, sys, getpass) appropriately. There are no suspicious data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoor mechanisms. It securely reads passwords and outputs results in a safe format. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate password strength testing tool. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or supply chain security issues are present. It appears to be a benign utility intended for local use.",
