  "purpose": "CLI utility for assessing password strength using Dropbox's zxcvbn library",
  "sources": "Password input via stdin or getpass, user inputs from command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Passes password to zxcvbn function, outputs JSON result to stdout",
  "flows": "Input reading (stdin/getpass) -> zxcvbn analysis -> JSON output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward input handling and output formatting",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads passwords either from stdin or interactively, then passes them to the zxcvbn password strength estimator, and outputs the result as JSON. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The minor variations in securityRisk scores across reports (0.1) are overly cautious; given the benign nature, it should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI utility for password strength estimation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in reports are appropriate, except the slightly elevated securityRisk scores which should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
