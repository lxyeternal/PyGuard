  "purpose": "A command-line utility for evaluating password strength using Dropbox's zxcvbn implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin and command-line arguments, particularly user input data for password analysis.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON results to stdout, does not write to files or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Reads password from stdin or getpass(), then processes it through zxcvbn() with user inputs, finally outputs JSON to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious code behaviors or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries securely. No malicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an argument parser and a JSON encoder, then determines whether input password is provided via stdin or prompt. It calls zxcvbn for password strength estimation with optional user data. The output is JSON-formatted results. All code appears to perform a straightforward password analysis without any malicious or suspicious operations. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code structure is standard for CLI tools, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign password strength estimator CLI utility. It reads passwords securely, processes them with a reputable library, and outputs results locally without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
