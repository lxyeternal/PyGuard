  "purpose": "This code is designed to estimate the strength of passwords by analyzing various patterns, guesses, and match sequences to compute password guessability metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'password' string, match objects in various pattern estimation functions, and the 'matches' list passed to most_guessable_match_sequence.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations of guesses, guesses_log10, and sequences, but does not perform data output, network communication, or file access.",
  "flows": "Extracts match tokens and pattern details -> estimates guesses via pattern-specific functions -> accumulates guess estimates into overall metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors detected. Functions and variables are related to password strength estimation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs password strength analysis through pattern matching, guess estimations, and dynamic programming for sequence optimization. Functions like estimate_guesses, bruteforce_guesses, and pattern-specific guess functions are used for computation. No external data transmission, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears well-structured for a security-related purpose, focusing on password guess estimation without any suspicious or malicious code sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of password strength estimation algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It purely performs computational analysis related to password guessing strength.",
