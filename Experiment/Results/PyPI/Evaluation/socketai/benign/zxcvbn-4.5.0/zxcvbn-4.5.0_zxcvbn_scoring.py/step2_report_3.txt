  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's for password strength estimation, reading from password string and match objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network actions; calculations are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate password estimation code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. The code performs standard password guess estimation with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on password strength, pattern guesses, and pattern-specific functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; calculations are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors; dependencies are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, detailed password strength estimation code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Password strength, match sequence optimization, and pattern guess estimation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interactions; calculations are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code; standard pattern matching and probabilistic modeling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid password strength estimator, high confidence (1.0), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Password strength metrics, guess estimation, pattern analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; straightforward mathematical and pattern analysis.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; code is standard for password estimation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Analyzes password strength via heuristic models and combinatorics.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward pattern estimation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid password estimation code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious code:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1–0.2 (low, consistent with password estimation libraries)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of password guessability estimation.\n- No signs of backdoors, malicious logic, or suspicious external dependencies.\n- The high confidence levels in the reports are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a legitimate password strength estimation module with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a low security risk score.",
