{
  "purpose": "This code implements password strength estimation functions, including calculating guessability of password patterns, sequence analysis, and subpattern variations, likely for assessing password security.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'password', 'match' objects, and regex matches. Uses constants and imported modules for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations and returns guesses, guesses logs, and sequence data. No sinks appear to send data externally or perform destructive actions.",
  "flows": "Source data (password, matches) flows into guess estimations, which propagate through various pattern-specific functions to compute guess counts. Final guesses are returned as numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or unusual code structures are detected. Code appears focused on pattern matching and mathematical modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for calculating password guess estimates based on pattern matching, including brute-force, dictionary, spatial, sequence, regex, and date patterns. It utilizes common mathematical functions, regex patterns, and imported adjacency graphs to estimate guesses. No evidence of malicious logic such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The calculations and pattern analyses are consistent with password strength estimators. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is present. The only external dependencies are standard Python libraries and a local module for adjacency graphs, which are used for pattern analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs detailed password guess estimation through pattern analysis without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It strictly focuses on password strength estimation and pattern calculations. There are no signs of malware or harmful actions.",
