{
  "purpose": "This code implements password strength estimation functions, including match sequence optimization, guess estimations for different password patterns, and complexity calculations for common password patterns (e.g., dictionary, spatial, sequence, regex, date). It appears to be part of a password strength or security analysis library.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as 'password', 'matches', and 'match' objects. Data is obtained from match dictionaries, regular expressions, and external adjacency graph modules.",
  "sinks": "Calculations and function returns involve guesses counts, probabilities, and guess estimations. No external system interaction or data exfiltration points are evident. No network, file, or environment variable access is present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from data input (password, matches) through various guess estimation functions, then through optimization routines (most_guessable_match_sequence), ultimately returning a password guess count and sequence. No external data or side-effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code's structure is consistent with password strength estimation logic. No obfuscated or misleading code is present. All calculations are deterministic and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive password strength calculations, including pattern matching, guess estimation per pattern type, and sequence optimization to find the most guessable sequence. It uses standard mathematical and regex functions, and depends on external adjacency graphs for spatial guess calculations. No network or system access, data exfiltration, or malicious code constructs are identified. The code’s purpose aligns with password security evaluation, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a password strength estimation module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs legitimate cryptographic analysis functions, with clear and transparent operations. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident within this module.",
