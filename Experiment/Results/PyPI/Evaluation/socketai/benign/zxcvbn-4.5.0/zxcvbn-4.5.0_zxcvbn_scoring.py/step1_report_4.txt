{
  "purpose": "The code calculates password strength metrics and estimates guesses for different types of password patterns to evaluate password security.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as 'password', 'matches', and 'match' objects. External data includes imported modules and adjacency graphs.",
  "sinks": "Calculations involve mathematical operations for guesses and pattern analysis; no direct data leaks or malicious network actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (password and match objects) flow into guess estimation functions; these outputs influence the dynamic programming search for the minimal guess sequence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is largely mathematical and pattern-based, with no unusual control flow or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a password guess estimation algorithm, analyzing patterns like dictionary words, repeats, sequences, spatial patterns, regex matches, and dates. It uses dynamic programming to optimize guess sequences and calculates guesses based on pattern complexities. All functions perform pattern recognition or combinatorial calculations. No network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code structure appears standard and well-organized, focusing solely on password strength estimation. No anomalies or malicious behaviors such as hidden backdoors, system damage, or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password strength estimator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs pattern-based guess calculations for assessing password strength without engaging in harmful activities or malicious behaviors.",
