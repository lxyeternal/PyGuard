  "purpose": "Password strength estimation through pattern matching, guess calculation, and sequence optimization.",
  "sources": "Input password string, match objects from pattern recognition functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal computations; no external data leaks, network activity, or destructive actions.",
  "flows": "Pattern match objects serve as sources; guess estimation functions process these; sequence optimization determines minimal guesses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive password guessability estimator, utilizing pattern matching, combinatorial calculations, and dynamic programming for sequence optimization. It relies solely on internal computations, mathematical functions, and pattern recognition, with no external system interactions or obfuscation. The functions are standard for password strength estimation, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scoring of malware as 0 and low security risk scores are consistent with the benign, purpose-specific nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured password strength estimation module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The existing scores—malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk (~0.1–0.2)—are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
