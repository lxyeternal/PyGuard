  "purpose": "Unit testing for comparing the performance and correctness of DTW and accelerated_dtw functions with different inputs.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand, np.random.randint, dtw, accelerated_dtw",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output operations; all data is internally generated and used within tests.",
  "flows": "np.random.rand/np.random.randint generate input data used directly in DTW functions; no external data flows or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard testing framework usage and legitimate numerical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing using the unittest framework. It generates random data for testing DTW functions, compares outputs for consistency, and verifies expected results on specific cases. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network connections, or malicious code are present. All operations are typical numerical tests with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of unit tests for DTW functions with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
