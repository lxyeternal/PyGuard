{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions to compute Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between sequences, including a faster version using scipy's cdist, and visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequences 'x' and 'y', and distance functions. Also reads environment variables indirectly via imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that output untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions such as network communication or file manipulation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences through DTW computations, with distances calculated using provided functions. No external or untrusted data flows to any sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs standard DTW computation and visualization. No suspicious code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines DTW algorithms with options for windowing and warping, using numpy and scipy for efficiency. It includes visualization of results. All components are standard for sequence alignment tasks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The imports are from common scientific libraries, and the code execution is limited to computation and plotting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of DTW algorithms with visualization. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be a legitimate, standard sequence similarity tool.",
