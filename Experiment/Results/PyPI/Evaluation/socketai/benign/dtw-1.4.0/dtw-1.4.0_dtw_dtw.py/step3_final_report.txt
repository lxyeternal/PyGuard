  "purpose": "Implementation of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, including accelerated and visualization features, for sequence similarity analysis.",
  "sources": "Sequences x and y, distance functions, optional visualization inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data remains within the process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences through DTW computation to visualization; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected; code uses standard scientific libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DTW algorithms with optional acceleration using scipy's cdist. It performs internal data processing with no external communication or malicious operations. Assertions ensure input validity. Visualization code is benign and for demonstration. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, uses common libraries, and aligns with typical DTW implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DTW algorithms with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in sequence analysis tasks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1).",
