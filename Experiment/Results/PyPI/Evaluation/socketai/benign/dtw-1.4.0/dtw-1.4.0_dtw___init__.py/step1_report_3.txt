  "purpose": "Importing functions 'dtw' and 'accelerated_dtw' from a local module 'dtw' and the package version from a local module 'version'.",
  "sources": "Reading from local modules '.dtw' and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to output or sink; purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; standard module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements, importing specific functions and a version string from local modules within the package. There are no indications of data handling, external network activity, or code execution. No signs of malicious activity such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The structure is typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern used to include internal modules and package metadata.",
