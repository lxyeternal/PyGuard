{
  "purpose": "Importing functions 'dtw' and 'accelerated_dtw' from the local 'dtw' module and the package version from the local 'version' module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .dtw and .version.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only contains import statements without dynamic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions from local modules and assigns the version string to __version__. There are no network operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. All imports are from relative local modules, which is common for package internal structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of normal package structure. No malicious intent detected.",
