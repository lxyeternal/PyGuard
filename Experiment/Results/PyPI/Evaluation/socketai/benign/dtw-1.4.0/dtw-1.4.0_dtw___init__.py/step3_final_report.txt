  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules 'dtw' and 'version' and assigns the version to __version__, serving as a package initialization or internal setup.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.dtw and .version).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions and version info; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static imports with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, external network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign internal import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
