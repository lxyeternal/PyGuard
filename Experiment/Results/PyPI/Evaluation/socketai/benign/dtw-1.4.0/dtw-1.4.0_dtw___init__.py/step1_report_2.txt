{
  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and version information from local modules, likely for use in a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .dtw and .version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports functions and variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions 'dtw' and 'accelerated_dtw' from a local module '.dtw' and 'version' as '__version__' from a local module '.version'. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external network interactions. The code appears standard for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as part of a module import structure. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
