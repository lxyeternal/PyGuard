  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and version information from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.dtw and .version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only internal imports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions 'dtw' and 'accelerated_dtw' from a local module '.dtw' and imports a version string from '.version'. These are standard import statements used to include internal package functionalities and metadata. No external network activity, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior is apparent. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard, benign import statement from local modules. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present.",
