  "purpose": "Importing functions 'dtw' and 'accelerated_dtw' from a local module 'dtw', and importing the package version from a local module 'version'.",
  "sources": "Reading local modules 'dtw' and 'version' within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is only importing functions and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard module import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and versioning information. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code structure and syntax are straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement block used for module organization and versioning. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
