  "purpose": "Assign a version string identifier for the software component.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, straightforward variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '1.4.0' to the variable 'version'. It contains no input/output, no data flows, no complex logic, and no suspicious patterns. The code is minimal, benign, and typical for version declaration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
