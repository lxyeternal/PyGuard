{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'dtw' Python package, including version, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The version is loaded from 'dtw/version.py' using imp.load_source.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output in the code.",
  "flows": "The version information flows from 'dtw/version.py' into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'imp' module instead of 'importlib'; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and dynamically loads version info via imp.load_source, which is deprecated but not malicious. The setup configuration appears standard for packaging a Python module. No user input, external data, or network activity is present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'imp' is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code present.",
