  "flows": "Static package setup without dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'imp' module for loading version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It loads version info via 'imp.load_source', which is outdated but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or runtime code execution. The only issue is the deprecated module, which does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code is static and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, reflecting low risk primarily due to outdated practices but no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the outdated 'imp' module, which does not impact security. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
