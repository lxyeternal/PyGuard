{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'dtw', providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from 'dtw/version.py' using imp.load_source.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The version source flows into the setup() function to specify package version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'imp' module instead of 'importlib'; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'imp' to load the version from an external file, then calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network communication, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not perform any runtime behavior beyond package configuration. The use of 'imp' is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of deprecated 'imp' module is noted but not malicious. Overall, this is a benign setup configuration script.",
