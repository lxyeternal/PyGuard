  "purpose": "Unit testing import statements for the 'dtw' package and its components",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import dtw', 'from dtw import dtw as dist', 'from dtw import accelerated_dtw', 'from dtw import __version__'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Import statements are static and do not process untrusted data; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; simple import tests",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unittest TestCase with two tests that import the 'dtw' package and its components. The imports are static and do not involve dynamic execution or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup for verifying the presence and accessibility of the 'dtw' package and its attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test that imports a package and its attributes for testing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears benign and does not involve any suspicious or malicious code.",
