{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify the importability of the 'dtw' package and its components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'dtw' package and its attributes (__version__, dtw, accelerated_dtw) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Import statements are source points; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The imports are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports a package and its attributes within unit test functions, with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external communications. All imports are standard practice for testing package availability and versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit test to check package imports and version retrieval. No malicious intent, no suspicious code behavior detected.",
