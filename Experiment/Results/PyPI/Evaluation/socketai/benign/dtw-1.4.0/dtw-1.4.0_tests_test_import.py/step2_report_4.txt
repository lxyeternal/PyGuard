  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward unit test that imports the 'dtw' package and its components.\n- They agree that the code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted data.\n- The purpose appears to be verifying the presence and structure of the package, including its version attribute.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are reported or evident.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of static imports and simple tests.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The code's simplicity and benign nature are well-established; no changes needed.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign unit test with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe unit test verifying package importability.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are justified.",
