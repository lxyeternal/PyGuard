  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",

  "flows": "Not applicable (no code snippets provided).",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation and dynamic execution features noted in Report 4; no concrete malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with high confidence scores (0.9) and low malware and obfuscation scores (0). Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation (0.4) and moderate suspicion (malware 0.3, risk 0.45). Other reports are consistent in their assessments. Given the descriptions, scores align with the evidence, with Report 4 justifiably reflecting suspicion. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed; suspicion is based on code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is benign with low security risk. Report 4's suspicion is justified but not definitive. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary beyond slight consideration of increasing malware suspicion in Report 4 if further evidence emerges.",
