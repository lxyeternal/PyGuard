  "purpose": "Unit tests for the dtw (Dynamic Time Warping) function, verifying correctness, symmetry, warping, and input validation.",
  "sources": "Predefined numpy arrays within test functions, used as input data for dtw calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal computations and assertions only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy array definitions through dtw function calls to assertions verifying expected outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a mathematical algorithm, with no external input/output, network activity, or malicious constructs. It uses standard libraries and clear assertions. No anomalies or security issues are present. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. The data and logic are internal and controlled. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the dtw function, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
