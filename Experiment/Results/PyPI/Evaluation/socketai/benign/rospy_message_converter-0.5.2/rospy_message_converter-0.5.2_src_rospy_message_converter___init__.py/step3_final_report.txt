  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic features, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, network calls, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, system commands, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as code inputs or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to sinks like network calls or file writes, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation (e.g., complex or misleading code), dynamic code execution, unusual import patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of obfuscation and complexity. Reports 1 and 5 mention obfuscation and dynamic features, which could conceal malicious intent. Reports 2, 3, and 4 show no code or benign code. The malware scores in reports 1 and 5 should be slightly increased to reflect suspicion from obfuscation and dynamic features, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. Obfuscation scores are justified based on code complexity. Risk scores are moderate where suspicion exists, low otherwise. Overall, the scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning, with a slight adjustment in report 5's malware score to 0.3 to better reflect potential hidden malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but obfuscation and dynamic features in reports 1 and 5 warrant cautious malware scoring. No confirmed malicious activity is detected. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score to 0.3 improves alignment with its suspicious features. Overall, the security risk remains low, with moderate concern in obfuscated or dynamic code scenarios.",
