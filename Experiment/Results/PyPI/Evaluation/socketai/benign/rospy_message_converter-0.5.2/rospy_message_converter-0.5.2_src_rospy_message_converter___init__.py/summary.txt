  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but obfuscation and dynamic features in reports 1 and 5 warrant cautious malware scoring. No confirmed malicious activity is detected. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score to 0.3 improves alignment with its suspicious features. Overall, the security risk remains low, with moderate concern in obfuscated or dynamic code scenarios."
