  "sources": "json.loads(json_message), message_converter.convert_dictionary_to_ros_message, message_converter.convert_ros_message_to_dictionary, json.dumps(dictionary)",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally without external output or network activity",
  "flows": "json_message -> json.loads -> dictionary -> convert_dictionary_to_ros_message -> ROS message; ROS message -> convert_ros_message_to_dictionary -> dictionary -> json.dumps -> json_message",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON parsing and serialization, relying on external libraries for ROS message conversion. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The functions handle data transformation securely, with minimal inherent risks associated with JSON parsing. No network activity or environment manipulation occurs. The risk scores in reports are low, justified by the benign nature of the code and reliance on trusted libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for ROS message conversion. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
