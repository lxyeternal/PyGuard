  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for TensorFlow graph optimization, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. It performs pattern matching and node rewriting to improve runtime efficiency. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by its internal, non-malicious purpose."
