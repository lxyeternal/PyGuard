  "purpose": "This code performs pattern matching and graph rewriting to fuse DepthwiseConv2dNative + BiasAdd + Activation into a single optimized node for TensorFlow models.",
  "sources": "The code reads nodes from the input graph definition, accessing node attributes and inputs via 'graph_rewrite_util.node_from_map' and iterating over 'input_graph_def.node'.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data flows or leaks; the modifications are confined to internal graph structures, updating node attributes and inputs.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching functions identify specific node sequences; matched nodes are then fused by updating their attributes and inputs, replacing multiple nodes with a single fused node.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or external communication. The code is straightforward and performs standard graph optimization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code scans the graph for specific patterns of convolution, bias addition, and activation functions. It uses utility functions to identify supported activation types and matching patterns. When a pattern is found, it modifies the nodes to fuse the operations, updating node attributes and inputs accordingly. The process involves two passes: one for patterns with activation and bias, and another for bias-only patterns. The code operates solely on internal graph data structures, with no external data handling or malicious behavior. It is a typical TensorFlow graph rewriting utility aimed at performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for TensorFlow graph optimization, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. It performs pattern matching and node rewriting to improve runtime efficiency. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by its internal, non-malicious purpose.",
