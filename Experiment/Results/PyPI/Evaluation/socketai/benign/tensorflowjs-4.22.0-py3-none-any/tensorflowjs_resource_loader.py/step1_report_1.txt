  "purpose": "Resource management library for opening files and listing directory contents relative to a specific module path.",
  "sources": "The functions read input paths provided as arguments to open_file() and list_dir(), which are used to determine file system locations.",
  "sinks": "The open() function in open_file(), and os.listdir() in list_dir(), which access the filesystem based on provided paths.",
  "flows": "Input paths are joined with the directory of the current script, then passed to open() or os.listdir() to access files or directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and limited to filesystem operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: open_file() and list_dir(). Both functions construct a path relative to the current script's directory and then perform filesystem operations (opening files or listing directories). There are no external inputs from untrusted sources beyond function arguments, and no data is transmitted over networks. The code does not perform any data manipulation, injection, or obfuscation. It is a simple resource management utility, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for resource management without any malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on provided paths relative to its location, with no indication of misuse or malicious actions.",
