{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to open files and list directory contents relative to the script's location.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided as function arguments to 'open_file' and 'list_dir'.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations: 'open()' and 'os.listdir()' using constructed paths.",
  "flows": "Input paths are joined with the script's directory and then used directly in filesystem calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs absolute paths based on the script's directory and performs standard filesystem operations. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are simple, safe, and rely on caller-provided paths, which could be misused if malicious paths are supplied, but this is typical for resource management utilities. No signs of obfuscation or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of input paths, but the code itself is safe.",
