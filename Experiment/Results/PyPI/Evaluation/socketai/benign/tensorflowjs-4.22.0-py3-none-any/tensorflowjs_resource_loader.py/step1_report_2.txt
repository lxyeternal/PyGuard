  "purpose": "Resource management library for opening files and listing directory contents relative to a specific module.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided to the open_file and list_dir functions.",
  "targets": "File system operations via open() and os.listdir() that access files and directories based on user-provided paths.",
  "flows": "Input paths from function arguments are combined with the script's directory path and used directly in file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected. Functions perform standard file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions for resource management: open_file and list_dir. Both functions construct an absolute path based on the directory of the current script and a relative path input. The input paths are then used directly in filesystem calls. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses standard Python libraries and safe practices for handling paths. The functions could be misused if provided with malicious paths, but they do not inherently contain malicious behavior. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward resource management utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs safe file and directory operations relative to its location. No security risks or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
