  "purpose": "Resource management library for opening files and listing directories relative to the script location.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to get file paths, open files, and list directory contents.",
  "sinks": "File opening and directory listing functions that access local filesystem resources.",
  "flows": "Path input is used to generate absolute paths which are then used to open files or list directories.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions for handling file resources: open_file and list_dir. Both functions resolve relative paths based on the current script's directory and perform filesystem operations—opening files and listing directory contents. No external network communication, no use of untrusted input beyond filesystem paths, and no hidden or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard resource handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign resource management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic filesystem operations safely without involving untrusted input beyond user-supplied paths, which are used securely with path resolution.",
