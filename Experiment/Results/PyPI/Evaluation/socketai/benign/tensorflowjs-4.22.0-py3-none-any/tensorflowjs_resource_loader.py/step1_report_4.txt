  "purpose": "Resource management library for opening files and listing directory contents relative to the script's location.",
  "sources": "Reads the file path input from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the open() function and os.listdir(), which access the filesystem based on the provided paths.",
  "flows": "Input path -> path modification (os.path.join, os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname) -> filesystem access (open or os.listdir).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard library functions for filesystem access without any obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily resolves relative paths to absolute paths based on the script's directory and then performs standard filesystem operations: opening files and listing directory contents. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, executing external commands, or hidden backdoors. The use of os.path and open functions is typical for resource management. No untrusted input handling beyond function parameters, which are expected to be controlled by the user or application logic, is evident. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign resource management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely handles relative paths and performs standard filesystem operations without suspicious behavior.",
