  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for loading TensorFlow.js model weights with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concerns primarily related to file handling in untrusted environments. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent."
