{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build and retrieve a mapping between Keras classes and their corresponding TensorFlow module paths for introspection purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and module objects using inspect.getmembers on the keras module.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially exposes internal class/module structure via the get_module_path function, but does not appear to leak sensitive data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The code inspects keras module members, builds a map of class names to module paths, and retrieves module paths based on class names, primarily through inspect and tf_export functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code relies on official TensorFlow APIs and standard inspection techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code imports TensorFlow Keras, inspects all class and module members to map class names to their module paths using TensorFlow's tf_export utility, and provides a function to retrieve the module path given a class name. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. It primarily facilitates internal introspection, which is common in API or library development. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security-critical operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal mapping and introspection within the TensorFlow/Keras ecosystem. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats.",
