{
  "purpose": "The code aims to build a mapping between Keras classes and their corresponding module paths in TensorFlow for introspection or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the keras module and its classes via inspect.getmembers, and uses tf_export.get_canonical_name_for_symbol to retrieve canonical names.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the global dictionary TFCLASS_MODULE_MAP and raises KeyError if a class is not found. No untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "inspect.getmembers iterates over keras module members (source). The module names are retrieved through tf_export (source). The mapping is stored in TFCLASS_MODULE_MAP (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard introspection functions. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs introspection on the keras module to build a map of class names to module paths by inspecting classes and submodules. It relies on standard Python inspect functions and TensorFlow utility functions, with no external data input or output, and no network or system calls. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears benign and intended for debugging or utility purposes within a development environment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for introspection of Keras classes within TensorFlow. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or malware-like characteristics. It is safe based on the current analysis.",
