{
  "purpose": "The code performs introspection on the TensorFlow Keras module to map class names to their module paths, facilitating internal class-module resolution.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers() iterates over classes and modules within keras; tf_export.get_canonical_name_for_symbol() retrieves canonical class names.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; internal reflection only.",
  "flows": "Class definitions are inspected and mapped; no external data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of introspection APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python reflection and TensorFlow APIs to build a class-to-module mapping. It performs recursive module traversal, handles errors appropriately, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The purpose is internal utility, with no external communication or data leaks. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for class-module mapping within TensorFlow's Keras API. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
