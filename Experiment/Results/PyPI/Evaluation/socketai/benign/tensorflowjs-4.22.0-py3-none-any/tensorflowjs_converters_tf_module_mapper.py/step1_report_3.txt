{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build a mapping between class names in the keras module and their corresponding module paths in TensorFlow's internal structure, enabling retrieval of module paths for given class names.",
  "sources": "The code reads the keras module via `inspect.getmembers(keras)` and the output of `tf_export.get_canonical_name_for_symbol()` for each class.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially raise a KeyError if an unknown class name is requested, but does not directly perform any unsafe actions with untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input: class names via `get_module_path`; Internal: `inspect.getmembers()` and `tf_export.get_canonical_name_for_symbol()`; Output: returned module path or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious modules, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard reflection and TensorFlow utilities, which are common in package development.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs introspection to map classes to their module paths within TensorFlow, using standard Python reflection (`inspect`) and TensorFlow's `tf_export` utility. It includes a recursive function to traverse modules and a lookup function with error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The code relies on publicly available TensorFlow APIs and standard Python features, with no network access, data leaks, or harmful actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for mapping class names to module paths within TensorFlow's keras module. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs safe reflection and lookups without insecure practices.",
