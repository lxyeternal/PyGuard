{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically maps class names to their module paths within the TensorFlow Keras framework for introspection and utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and module information using inspect.getmembers and tf_export.get_canonical_name_for_symbol.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input class names are used to retrieve module paths via the TFCLASS_MODULE_MAP dictionary; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present; the code performs standard reflection and mapping functions.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a mapping between class names and their module paths in TensorFlow Keras by inspecting the keras module. It uses inspect.getmembers to gather class and module information and tf_export to obtain canonical names. The map is built recursively for nested modules. The get_module_path function retrieves the stored module path for a given class name, initializing the map if necessary. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data flows, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and uses public API functions for introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for class-module mapping within TensorFlow's Keras API, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs reflective operations for framework introspection without external data or untrusted inputs.",
