  "purpose": "Indicates version information for an auto-generated code file, with no apparent functional purpose beyond version tracking.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The comment states that the code is auto-generated, but the code itself is minimal and standard. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment, a version assignment, and a note about auto-generation. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. The minimal content suggests no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign snippet primarily serving as version annotation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
