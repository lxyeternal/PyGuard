  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n1. **Code Content & Evidence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely static, consisting of comments and a simple variable assignment (`version = '4.22.0'`).\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or data flows.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The presence of auto-generation and license comments is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's minimal and static nature.\n   - No changes are necessary for these scores based on the provided code snippet.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only a version indicator with license comments, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is metadata, not executable logic, and pose no security threat.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n   - No further action or adjustment is needed.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving as metadata. The assessments are accurate, and no modifications are warranted.",
