  "purpose": "Metadata declaration indicating version and license information for an auto-generated file.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string; license comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no dynamic or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only comments and a static variable; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, static, and auto-generated, consisting solely of comments and a version string assignment. No inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or executable logic are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code does not contain any malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata file with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
