{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for mapping neural network layers to quantization data types and performing weight quantization and dequantization for neural network models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays ('data') and configuration parameters ('names', 'quantization_dtype_map', 'metadata', etc.).",
  "sinks": "The code performs data processing and returns quantized data, dequantized weights, and metadata. No external network calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (numpy arrays and configuration maps) flow through quantization/dequantization functions, resulting in quantized weights, metadata, or dequantified weights, without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward quantization routines. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. No data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily dedicated to neural network weight quantization, including mapping layer names to quantization data types, performing linear quantization, and dequantization. It uses well-known numpy operations, with no external network calls or malicious system modifications. No anomalies such as hidden code, code injection, or suspicious file operations are present. The functions are standard for model optimization routines, and all data flows are confined within in-memory numpy operations. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The code appears legitimate and focused solely on data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of neural network weight quantization and mapping, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely processes numerical data for model optimization and does not perform any harmful actions.",
