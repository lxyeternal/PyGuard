  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear focus on weight quantization, no external data or network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard quantization code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, straightforward weight quantization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no network or system modification.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same functions, standard numpy-based processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, pattern matching is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, normal utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero but still very low).  \n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score is acceptable, given the pattern matching utility could theoretically be misused if patterns are user-controlled, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, standard operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, pattern matching is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard quantization code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still low).  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable given the pattern matching potential misuse, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, no external dependencies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical quantization utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code performs numerical processing typical for neural network quantization.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), primarily due to pattern matching which could be misused if patterns are user-controlled, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, related to pattern matching flexibility but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for neural network weight quantization with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. The minor risk score reflects the potential for pattern misuse but does not indicate actual threat.\n\n**Recommendations:** No immediate action needed. Continue monitoring if pattern inputs are user-controlled, but as provided, the code is safe.",
