  "purpose": "Provides functions for mapping layer names to quantization data types and performing weight quantization and dequantization for neural network models.",
  "sources": "Reads layer names, weight data arrays, and pattern matching for layer name filtering.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; processes data in-memory without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Layer name patterns are matched to assign data types; weight data is quantized/dequantized based on these mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; pattern matching is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard weight quantization utilities, including mapping layer names to data types via pattern matching, and functions for quantizing and dequantizing weights with proper validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication is present. Pattern matching could be misused if layer names are maliciously crafted, but within this context, it is a benign utility. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for model optimization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of neural network weight quantization utilities. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The slight increase in security risk score (0.1-0.2) reflects the potential misuse of pattern matching if layer names are user-controlled, but this does not constitute an actual threat in the given context.",
