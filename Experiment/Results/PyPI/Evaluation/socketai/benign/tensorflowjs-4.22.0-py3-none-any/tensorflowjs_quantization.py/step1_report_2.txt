{
  "purpose": "The code is for quantization and dequantization of neural network weights, mapping layer names to quantization data types, and handling related calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays ('data' parameter in 'quantize_weights' and 'dequantize_weights'), and from the 'names' array for pattern matching in 'map_layers_to_quantization_dtype'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effect; the code performs data processing internally without external communication or system modification.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching in 'map_layers_to_quantization_dtype' from 'names' to assign data types; 'quantize_weights' and 'dequantize_weights' process numpy arrays based on metadata and data type; the functions do not interact with external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard implementation of quantization routines with proper parameter validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of functions implementing quantization/dequantization of weights with proper handling of range and data types. No signs of malicious logic such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. Functions operate solely on numpy arrays and configuration data. The pattern matching for layer names uses 'fnmatch' for mapping, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of quantization logic for neural network weights. It performs expected operations without malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage within this module.",
