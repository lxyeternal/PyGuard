{
  "purpose": "This code detects specific PReLU patterns generated by Keras in TensorFlow graphs and rewrites them into a single 'Prelu' node for optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads node attributes, constants, and pattern-matched nodes within the graph structure.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network activity; modifies internal graph nodes and attributes.",
  "flows": "Pattern detection from Relu, Neg, and Mul nodes to the replacement with a single Prelu node.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard pattern matching and graph rewriting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching to identify PReLU structures, modifies node attributes, and rewrites the graph for efficiency. It does not execute external code, network operations, or system commands. The logic is straightforward, targeting known graph patterns, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe graph optimization utility for TensorFlow models, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
