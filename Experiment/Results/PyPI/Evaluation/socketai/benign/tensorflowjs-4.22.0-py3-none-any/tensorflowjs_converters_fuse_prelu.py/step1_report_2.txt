{
  "purpose": "The code aims to identify and fuse certain Keras-generated PRelu structures into a single custom PRelu operation within a TensorFlow graph, improving inference efficiency.",
  "sources": "Reads graph nodes, including node inputs, node attributes, and constant tensors for alpha values.",
  "sinks": "Modifies nodes by replacing certain patterns with fused nodes; does not write or send data outside the process.",
  "flows": "Analyzes nodes for specific op patterns (Relu, Mul, Neg), then rewires and fuses them into a custom Prelu node; updates alpha constants accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs pattern recognition within a TensorFlow graph to identify PRelu structures generated by Keras, then fuses these into a custom op for optimized inference. It carefully maps and modifies nodes, ensuring correct node connections and attributes. It also handles potential graph inconsistencies, such as duplicate node names. The code focuses solely on graph transformations without external network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate graph optimization utility targeting deep learning models. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. It strictly performs internal graph rewrites for efficiency, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
