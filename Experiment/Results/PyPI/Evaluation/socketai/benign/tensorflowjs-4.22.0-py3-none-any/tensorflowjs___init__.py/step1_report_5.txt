{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import modules from the tensorflowjs package and assign the version to __version__, likely for a library or script related to TensorFlow.js.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflowjs (converters, quantization, version), and reading version.version",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__ from version.version; no external data sinks or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Import statements do not process untrusted data; assigning __version__ simply stores package info, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard for library version setup and imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard licensing comments, import statements, and version assignment. It does not include user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The imports are from a known library (tensorflowjs), and no suspicious or obfuscated behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a Python module involving tensorflowjs, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import and version assignment without any suspicious behavior.",
