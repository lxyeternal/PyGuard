{
  "purpose": "Import modules from tensorflowjs library and set version information for a Python package related to TensorFlow.js conversion tools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from tensorflowjs modules: converters, quantization, version",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Import modules -> assign __version__ from version.version",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment, license header is standard",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of license headers, import statements from tensorflowjs, and setting __version__ to version.version. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for a setup or initialization script. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup snippet for a TensorFlow.js Python package. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The provided reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
