{
  "purpose": "Maintain namespace compatibility for databricks.* packages using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ for namespace packaging.",
  "targets": "The code modifies __path__, which influences module import paths but does not directly handle untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil' and extension of __path__ modifies import behavior; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard namespace packaging technique.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal namespace package setup. It imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ attribute to support namespace packages as per PEP 420. This is a standard practice for maintaining package compatibility across multiple distributions. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs that could be exploited. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements, and it does not perform any data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package setup snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply modifies the __path__ attribute to support namespace packages, which is common in open-source Python packages.",
