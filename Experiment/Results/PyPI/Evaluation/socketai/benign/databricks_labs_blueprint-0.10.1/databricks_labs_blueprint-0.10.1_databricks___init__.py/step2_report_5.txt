  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python, specifically for databricks.* packages.\n- The code simply imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ attribute, which is a well-established practice.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or malicious functions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- The reasoning is consistent, and the analysis correctly identifies the code as standard namespace package support.\n- The conclusions are appropriate: the code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate, no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard and benign.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Critical considerations:**\n- The code is minimal and standard; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Since the code's purpose is explicitly to support namespace packages, and it does so in a typical manner, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than zero.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard namespace package support snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, non-malicious, and follows best practices for namespace packages. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
