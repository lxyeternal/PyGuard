{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extend the module's package path for namespace package compatibility, specifically related to databricks.* packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to extend the __path__ variable, which is used for module path configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no external data or inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__, which is a standard procedure for namespace packages and does not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and follows standard namespace package patterns. No unusual code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies the __path__ to support namespace packages, specifically for compatibility with databricks.* packages. This is a common pattern for namespace package support in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior. It neither reads untrusted input nor performs unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package setup snippet used for compatibility. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
