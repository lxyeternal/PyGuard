  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing `pkgutil` and extending `__path__` with `extend_path`. This pattern is a well-established method in Python for supporting namespace packages, especially in complex distributions like `databricks.*`. The code is straightforward, does not process user input, handle untrusted data, or perform any network or system modifications.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**  \nNo report indicates any malicious intent. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or external data handling. The repeated emphasis on standard practice and lack of anomalies supports that the code is benign.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Report's Logic**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as standard namespace package support code with no security concerns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with 0 being appropriate here. The code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \nAny claims suggesting vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code itself is not vulnerable. The reports correctly avoid speculative or exaggerated claims.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a standard namespace package support snippet, widely used and well-understood in Python packaging. It does not process untrusted data, does not perform any malicious operations, and adheres to best practices. The high confidence scores reflect this.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No further action or re-scoring is needed.",
