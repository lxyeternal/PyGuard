{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to extend the __path__ attribute for a namespace package to ensure compatibility with other databricks.* packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports 'pkgutil' to modify it.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__, imports 'pkgutil', and updates __path__ via extend_path method.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package support; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only modifies the __path__ attribute for namespace package compatibility by extending it with 'pkgutil'. This is a common pattern in Python for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious functions present. No code injection or unsafe operations are observed. The simplicity and adherence to standard namespace package practices suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
