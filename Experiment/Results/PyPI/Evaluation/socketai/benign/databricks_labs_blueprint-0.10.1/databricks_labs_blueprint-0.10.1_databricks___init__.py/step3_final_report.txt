  "purpose": "Support namespace package recognition for databricks.* packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' and extension of '__path__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network, or system modifications involved.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend '__path__' with 'extend_path' -> assign back to '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a minimal, standard pattern with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' with 'extend_path', a common and well-documented practice for supporting namespace packages in Python, especially for complex distributions like databricks.*. It contains no untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The pattern is straightforward, with no obfuscation or secrets. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and security risk at 0. The code's purpose is solely to support namespace package compatibility, and it does so safely and effectively.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace package support snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
