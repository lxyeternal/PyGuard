  "purpose": "A CLI framework for registering and routing commands in Databricks projects, handling argument parsing, client creation, and logging.",
  "sources": "JSON payloads for commands, environment info for client configuration, command function signatures for argument types.",
  "sinks": "Command invocation, SDK client instantiation, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "JSON input -> command lookup -> argument parsing and type conversion -> client creation -> command function call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code registers commands via decorators, parses JSON payloads for command execution, converts arguments safely based on annotations, and creates SDK clients with product info. It uses standard Python reflection and SDK patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Logging is controlled, and command functions are invoked in a controlled manner. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are present. The overall structure is clear and follows best practices for CLI design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI framework for Databricks with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to dynamic invocation but controlled and safe implementation.",
