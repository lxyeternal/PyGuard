{
  "purpose": "Provides a RateLimiter class and a rate_limited decorator to limit the rate of requests to prevent overloading services.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters from function arguments and current system time; acquires thread lock; calls time.time() and time.sleep().",
  "sinks": "Uses time.sleep() to pause execution based on rate limiting logic.",
  "flows": "Inputs: max_requests, burst_period_seconds, system time; flows through throttle() method which may invoke time.sleep().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. Rate limiting logic appears standard. No malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe rate limiting mechanism based on a leaky bucket algorithm. It reads configuration parameters from function calls, uses system time for rate calculations, and controls request flow via sleeping. No suspicious data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard rate limiting patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate rate limiting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for controlling request flow without any malicious side effects.",
