{
  "purpose": "The code sets user agent information for the Databricks SDK, including optional CLI version details from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION'",
  "sinks": "The with_user_agent_extra function likely modifies headers or logs with user agent data",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' flows into with_user_agent_extra as part of user agent information",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable to dynamically set user agent info is typical; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code found",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, retrieves an environment variable, and calls a function to set user agent details. It dynamically includes CLI version if available, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code only manipulates headers or logging details related to user agents, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard SDK setup tasks without any malicious or suspicious activity. It dynamically includes environment information for user agent configuration, which is common in SDK usage.",
