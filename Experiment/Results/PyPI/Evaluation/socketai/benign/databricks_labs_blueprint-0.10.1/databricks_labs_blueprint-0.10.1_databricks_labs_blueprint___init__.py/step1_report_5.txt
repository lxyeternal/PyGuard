  "purpose": "Set user agent headers with application and CLI version information for Databricks SDK",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION'",
  "sinks": "Function call 'with_user_agent_extra' which modifies headers or metadata",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' -> 'with_user_agent_extra' call",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable which could potentially be manipulated, but in this context is standard for version reporting",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and calls 'with_user_agent_extra' to append client and CLI version info. It reads an environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' and conditionally uses it to add extra user agent info. No data is sent over the network directly; the function likely modifies request headers. The environment variable is optional and not hardcoded. There are no malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The purpose appears to be telemetry or request identification.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, intended for setting user agent headers with version info. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
