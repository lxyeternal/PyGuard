  "purpose": "Set user-agent headers with optional CLI version.",

  "flows": "Environment variable read, passed into with_user_agent_extra().",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, reads an environment variable, and calls a function to augment request headers with version info. No data leaks, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable usage is standard and safe. The function likely modifies headers or logs, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to configure telemetry or request identification. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
