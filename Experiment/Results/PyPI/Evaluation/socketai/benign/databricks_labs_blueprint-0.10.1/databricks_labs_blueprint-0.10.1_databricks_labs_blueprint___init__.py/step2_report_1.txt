  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code and the security implications.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Imports modules.\n- Reads an environment variable `DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION`.\n- Calls `with_user_agent_extra()` twice to add \"blueprint\" and, if present, the CLI version.\n- No data leaks, no code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Set user-agent headers with optional CLI version.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is benign, standard environment variable usage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, with emphasis on telemetry.\n- **Analysis:** Also correct, no suspicious activity, environment variable usage is typical.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low), Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on SDK setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no malicious intent, standard practice.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Configure user agent info.\n- **Analysis:** Again, standard environment variable reading, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Set user agent headers with version info.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The scores for malware are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Critical Evaluation:\n- The code only reads environment variables and calls a function to modify request headers.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The environment variable `DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION` is used in a typical manner.\n- The function `with_user_agent_extra()` is presumed to modify headers or logs, which is benign in this context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard configuration)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. The minimal risk reflects standard SDK configuration practices, and no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments needed.",
