  "purpose": "Set custom user-agent headers for requests, including optional CLI version information.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The 'with_user_agent_extra' function likely modifies request headers or logging behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variable value (if present) is passed to 'with_user_agent_extra' to augment user-agent information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of environment variable is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets a custom user-agent string with application version info. It conditionally appends CLI version data if available via environment variable. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration routines are evident. The environment variable is used in a typical manner, and the 'with_user_agent_extra' function likely influences request headers or logging, which is standard behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply configures user-agent headers with application and CLI version info, based on environment variables. It appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
