  "purpose": "Configure user agent information with package and CLI version details for Databricks SDK",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' via os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "Potentially used in HTTP headers or logs through 'with_user_agent_extra'",
  "flows": "Read 'DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION' -> pass to 'with_user_agent_extra' to augment user agent",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets user agent metadata using a function 'with_user_agent_extra', and optionally includes CLI version if available. It reads environment variables securely and does not execute any untrusted data or system commands. The function 'with_user_agent_extra' appears to modify or enhance HTTP request headers or similar data, but without any evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. No data leaks, code injections, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet intended to augment user agent information for telemetry or logging purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
