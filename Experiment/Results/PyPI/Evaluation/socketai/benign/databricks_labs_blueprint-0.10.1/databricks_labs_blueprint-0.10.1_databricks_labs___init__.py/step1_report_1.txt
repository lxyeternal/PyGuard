{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the __path__ attribute to extend the namespace package path for compatibility with databricks.labs.* packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses the '__path__' variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply extends __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard namespace package extension as documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the '__path__' variable for the current namespace, ensuring compatibility with namespace packages. This is a common pattern for namespace packages and involves no user input, external data, or sensitive operations. The comment clarifies that the purpose is for compatibility with databricks.labs.* packages and references official packaging guidelines. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package compatibility, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
