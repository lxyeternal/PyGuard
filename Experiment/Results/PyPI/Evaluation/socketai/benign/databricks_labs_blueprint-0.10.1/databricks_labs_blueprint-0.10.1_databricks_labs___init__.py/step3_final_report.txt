  "purpose": "Support for Python namespace packages by extending __path__ to include multiple distributions contributing to the same namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' using 'extend_path'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' on '__path__' -> assign back to '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard namespace package pattern with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' for namespace package support, a common and documented pattern. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or data sinks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The purpose is purely structural, ensuring compatibility across multiple package distributions. The code is straightforward, well-understood, and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
