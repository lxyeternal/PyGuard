  "purpose": "Extend the package path for namespace compatibility in Python packages.",
  "sources": "The line '__path__ = __import__(\"pkgutil\").extend_path(__path__, __name__)' which imports and extends __path__ using pkgutil.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package support; no anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, enabling namespace package functionality. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to support multiple distributions under the same namespace. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not read user input, handle external data, or perform any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign pattern used in Python namespace packages to ensure compatibility across package distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
