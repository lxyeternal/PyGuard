{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to modify the package's __path__ for namespace package compatibility, specifically to ensure proper package resolution in a namespace package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports pkgutil to extend __path__ using extend_path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling is present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__ and passes it to pkgutil.extend_path, which then modifies __path__ for namespace resolution.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a minimal, standard namespace package setup snippet with no suspicious or unusual logic; it does not perform any network activity, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkgutil module and extends the __path__ variable for the current package using extend_path, which is a standard method for supporting namespace packages. It includes a comment about package compatibility and links to official packaging documentation. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious operations, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and aligned with common namespace package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard namespace package compatibility snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a purpose related to package structure and namespace management.",
