  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging setup, project root detection, and path handling in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'IDE_PROJECT_ROOTS'), the __file__ parameter for filesystem operations, and sys.argv for command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Logger configuration, exception raising when project root is not found.",
  "flows": "Filesystem traversal from __file__ upwards to locate project root; environment variable checks influence debug level; relative path computations for module naming.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for project utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem checks to find project root, configures loggers based on environment and command-line context, and handles path manipulations. It does not process untrusted input beyond filesystem and environment reads, nor does it execute dynamic code or network operations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the functions serve typical project setup purposes. The environment variable 'IDE_PROJECT_ROOTS' is used for IDE detection, which is common. The filesystem traversal to locate 'pyproject.toml' or 'setup.py' is standard. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal operational risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for project root detection, logging setup, and path handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
