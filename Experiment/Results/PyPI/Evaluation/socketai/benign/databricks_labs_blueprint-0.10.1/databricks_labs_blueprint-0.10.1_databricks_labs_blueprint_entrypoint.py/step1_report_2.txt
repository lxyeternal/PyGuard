  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging setup, project root detection, and path handling in Python projects",
  "sources": "__file__ parameter for determining project root and module paths, environment variables for debug detection, sys.argv for script name, filesystem for existence checks",
  "sinks": "logger creation and setting levels, raising exceptions if project root is not found, filesystem operations for directory traversal",
  "flows": "Input (__file__, environment variables, sys.argv) -> find_project_root/find_dir_with_leaf -> logger setup / exception raising / environment detection",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns. Functions perform standard filesystem and logging operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs project structure detection, logging configuration, and path manipulations. It uses environment variables and command-line arguments in typical ways. The find_project_root and find_dir_with_leaf functions traverse the filesystem to identify project boundaries, which is a standard approach. The is_in_debug function checks environment variables and script names to infer debug mode, which is common. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern might be reliance on environment variables or filesystem structure, but these are standard in development tools and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for project setup and logging configuration. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It safely handles project root detection and path management without insecure operations or hidden intents.",
