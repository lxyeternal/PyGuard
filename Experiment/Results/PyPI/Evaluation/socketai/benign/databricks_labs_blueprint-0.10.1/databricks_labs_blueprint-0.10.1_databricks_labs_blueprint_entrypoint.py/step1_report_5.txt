  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging setup, project root detection, and path handling in Python projects",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), reading the current script file (__file__), checking existence of files (Path.exists()), and command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration (logging.getLogger, setLevel), raising exceptions (raise NotADirectoryError)",
  "flows": "Environment variables and sys.argv influence debug level; __file__ guides project root and module name derivation; file existence checks for project root detection",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; use of environment variables is standard; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard project setup tasks: locating project root based on 'pyproject.toml' or 'setup.py', configuring loggers, determining debug mode from environment or sys.argv, and managing file paths. Functions are straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity identified. The code’s behavior aligns with typical project utility scripts, and the usage of external libraries is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility module for project setup and path management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The functions are safe, well-structured, and do not contain suspicious activities.",
