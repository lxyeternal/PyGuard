  "purpose": "Automated application upgrade deployment in a Databricks workspace, including version management and upgrade script execution.",
  "sources": "Loading upgrade scripts from 'upgrades' folder, reading version files, loading applied upgrade records, and importing external modules.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically importing and executing external upgrade scripts, which could potentially execute malicious code if scripts are tampered with.",
  "flows": "Script files in 'upgrades' folder are loaded via importlib, and their 'upgrade' functions are called, potentially executing arbitrary code. Version checks control flow based on version comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports and executes scripts without explicit validation or sandboxing, which could be dangerous if scripts are malicious or compromised. No validation or signatures for scripts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code manages upgrade scripts stored locally and applies them conditionally based on version comparisons. The script loading process uses importlib, which can execute arbitrary code if the script files are malicious. The code does not perform any signature verification or sandboxing on imported scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed. The logic flow relies on external scripts for upgrades, which introduces risk if scripts are malicious. Overall, the code appears designed for flexible upgrades but lacks safeguards against malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to load and run external upgrade scripts dynamically, which introduces potential security risks if the scripts are malicious or tampered with. No malicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration was detected within this code, but its reliance on external scripts without validation could be exploited.",
