  "purpose": "Manage and apply versioned upgrade scripts to a Databricks workspace, ensuring sequential upgrades without duplication.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version files, loads upgrade scripts dynamically from the 'upgrades' directory, and checks applied upgrades from a JSON record.",
  "sinks": "Executes the 'upgrade' function within each dynamically imported script, which can perform arbitrary operations on the workspace.",
  "flows": "Loads upgrade scripts based on version comparison, imports scripts dynamically, and calls their 'upgrade' functions with installation and workspace objects.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import without validation or signature verification, relying solely on filename conventions; no sandboxing or validation of external scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to facilitate plugin-like upgrades, dynamically importing scripts based on version naming. While the core logic is safe and well-structured, the main security concern is executing external scripts without validation, which could be malicious if scripts are compromised. No malicious code or obfuscation is present within this module. The dynamic import pattern is common but poses supply chain risks. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious scripts, and the security risk should account for the lack of validation. Given the absence of malicious activity in the core code, the malware score is low, but the external script execution risk warrants a moderate security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The core code is well-designed for upgrade management but relies on external scripts that could be malicious if compromised. No malicious code is present within this module, but the supply chain risk is notable. The malware score should be around 0.2, and the security risk around 0.4, to accurately reflect this risk profile.",
