  "conclusion": "The core code is well-designed for upgrade management but relies on external scripts that could be malicious if compromised. No malicious code is present within this module, but the supply chain risk is notable. The malware score should be around 0.2, and the security risk around 0.4, to accurately reflect this risk profile."
