  "purpose": "Automated application upgrade deployment and version management within a Databricks workspace.",
  "sources": "Reads from upgrade script files in the 'upgrades' directory, loads configuration and version info from files, and dynamically imports upgrade scripts.",
  "sinks": "Executes upgrade scripts which may run arbitrary code; loads modules dynamically; calls 'upgrade' functions in imported scripts.",
  "flows": "Loads upgrade scripts -> imports and executes their 'upgrade' function with installation and workspace objects -> updates applied upgrades list.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of modules from file paths; relies on script naming conventions for version parsing; no hardcoded credentials or secrets found; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages upgrades by dynamically loading scripts based on version comparison, and executes a known 'upgrade' callback. It relies on external upgrade scripts for actual changes, which could contain malicious code if malicious scripts are placed in the 'upgrades' directory. The script does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications directly. Its dynamic module loading and execution of external scripts pose a risk if the upgrade scripts are malicious or compromised, as they have full access to the installation context and workspace client. There is no evidence of intentionally malicious behavior or hidden backdoors in this code. The script’s design aligns with standard plugin/update mechanisms, and it assumes external scripts are trusted, which is a potential security concern if not properly verified.",
  "conclusion": "This code facilitates flexible, version-controlled upgrades via dynamically loaded scripts. While it does not inherently contain malicious code, its reliance on external upgrade scripts means that malicious scripts could be executed if those scripts are compromised. No active malicious behavior or malware signs are present in this code itself. Its security risk is moderate, contingent on the trustworthiness of the upgrade scripts. The overall malware score is low, but caution is advised with external scripts.",
