{
  "purpose": "Define a module that provides path manipulation functions similar to posixpath, with specific considerations for Databricks' path handling.",
  "sources": "The code imports join and sep from the posixpath module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statement with explanatory comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment explaining the purpose of a custom path module and a simple import statement. There are no dynamic executions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior. It relies on a standard library module (posixpath) and defines __all__ for export control. No data processing, user input handling, or network activity present. Overall, the code is minimal and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports functions from a standard library module and exports them, serving as a lightweight path utility for Databricks, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
