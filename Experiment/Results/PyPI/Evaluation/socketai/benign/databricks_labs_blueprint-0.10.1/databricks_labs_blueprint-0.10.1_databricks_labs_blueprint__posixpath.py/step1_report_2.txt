  "purpose": "Define and re-export path manipulation functions and constants similar to posixpath for Databricks' path handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'join' and 'sep' from the standard library 'posixpath' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports standard library functions and re-exports them; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code comments describe a custom path specification for Databricks, aligning with POSIX standards, but avoids using 'posixpath' directly in comparisons due to changes in Python 3.13. It then imports 'join' and 'sep' from 'posixpath' and re-exports them via '__all__'. The code is simple, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears as standard code for module setup and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports standard path functions for use within Databricks. There are no signs of malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks.",
