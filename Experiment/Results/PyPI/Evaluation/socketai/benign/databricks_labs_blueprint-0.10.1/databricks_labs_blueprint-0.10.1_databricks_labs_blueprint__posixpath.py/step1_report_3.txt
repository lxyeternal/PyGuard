  "purpose": "Define path manipulation functions similar to posixpath for Databricks, emphasizing path comparison behavior in Python 3.13.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'join' and 'sep' from posixpath.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports functions and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The comment clarifies intended behavior but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from the standard library 'posixpath' and exposes them via __all__. The comments clarify path handling behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and limited to module definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign import and export of path manipulation functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
