  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for executing Python code on Databricks clusters, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects potential misuse in untrusted contexts, but overall, it is safe for its intended purpose."
