  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for executing Python code on Databricks clusters, including AST transformations to convert return statements into print(json.dumps()), managing cluster context, executing commands via API, and parsing errors and results.",
  "sources": "Input code strings to the run() method, cluster ID provider, and command execution API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted code execution via run(), pip install commands, and code transformation that could be misused if processing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Input code -> AST transformation (if applicable) -> execution via API -> result parsing and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "The AST transformation converts return statements into print(json.dumps()), which could be exploited if processing untrusted code; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard remote code execution management with AST-based code transformation for capturing return values as JSON. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The transformation utility is benign and common in debugging or output capturing scenarios. The code manages cluster context securely and handles errors thoroughly. Potential risks include misuse if untrusted code is processed, but this is inherent to such frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent. No obfuscation patterns are detected. The scores across reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for executing Python code on Databricks clusters, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects potential misuse in untrusted contexts, but overall, it is safe for its intended purpose.",
