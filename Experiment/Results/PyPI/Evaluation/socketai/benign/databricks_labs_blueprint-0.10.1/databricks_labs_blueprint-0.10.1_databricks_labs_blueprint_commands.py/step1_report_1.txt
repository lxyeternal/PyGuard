  "purpose": "This code provides mechanisms to execute Python commands on Databricks clusters, transform code for JSON serialization, and handle command results, including error processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input code strings, cluster ID provider, and command execution results.",
  "sinks": "Executes code via API calls; prints and logs data; processes and returns results and errors.",
  "flows": "Input code flows into transformation methods; transformed code is sent to Databricks API; results are processed, possibly parsed as JSON or converted to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of AST to transform return statements into print(json.dumps()) may alter code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials detected; no suspicious network activity or file access is evident; code appears structured for legitimate remote execution and result handling.",
  "analysis": "The code includes an AST transformer to convert return statements into print(json.dumps()) calls, which facilitates capturing return values as JSON. This transformation is version-dependent and raises errors if incompatible. The CommandExecutor class manages cluster and command execution, including JSON parsing of results and error handling with detailed message extraction. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. All operations relate to remote code execution, error handling, and result processing in a controlled manner. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are evident; third-party dependencies are standard SDK imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for executing and handling Python code on Databricks clusters, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The AST transformation for return statements is a utility feature rather than a malicious backdoor. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit malware or dangerous security risks.",
