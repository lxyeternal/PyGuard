{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling NMB session and direct TCP session messages, including decoding binary data.",
  "sources": "Reads binary data streams in the decode methods of NMBSessionMessage and DirectTCPSessionMessage classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; data is only processed within the decode functions without executing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Data is read from byte sequences, unpacked, and stored in class attributes. No external system calls or data transmissions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with standard struct unpacking and boundary checks. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and message parsing classes that decode binary protocols. The decode methods include size checks to prevent buffer overflows and interpret header fields. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; no external network or system interactions occur. The logic is consistent with standard binary data parsing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of message decoding for a network protocol, with appropriate safety checks. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. It appears safe and benign.",
