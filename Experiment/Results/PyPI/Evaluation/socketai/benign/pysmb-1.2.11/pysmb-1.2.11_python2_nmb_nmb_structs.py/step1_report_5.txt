{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling NMB protocol session messages, including decoding binary data streams.",
  "sources": "Reads binary data streams passed to decode methods, and class attributes for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the decode functions into class attributes; no data is sent elsewhere or triggers external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured parsing of network protocol messages. It carefully checks data lengths before decoding, preventing buffer overflows. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or code injection mechanisms are present. The only operations are unpacking binary data into class attributes, which is standard for protocol implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of protocol message parsing with proper data validation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured and safe.",
