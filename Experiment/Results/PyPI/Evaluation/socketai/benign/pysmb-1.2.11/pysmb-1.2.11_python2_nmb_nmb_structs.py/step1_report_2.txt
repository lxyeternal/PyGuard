{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for handling NMB and Direct TCP session messages, including decoding message data from byte streams.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from byte sequences passed to the decode methods.",
  "sinks": "The data attribute stores decoded message content; no other data sinks or output actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the input byte stream during decode methods; the data is stored internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual logic beyond standard unpacking. The code performs standard parsing of message headers.",
  "analysis": "The classes parse message headers with specified struct formats. decode methods check data length, unpack headers, and extract message data. No external system calls, network communication, or environment variable usage. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The logic is straightforward, with proper bounds checking and error handling. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or hidden functionalities. The code does not perform any actions beyond data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of message parsing classes with no malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
