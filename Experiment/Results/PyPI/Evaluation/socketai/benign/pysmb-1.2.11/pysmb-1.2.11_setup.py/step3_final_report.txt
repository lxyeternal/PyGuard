{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) used for packaging the `pysmb` library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (`sys.version_info`) to determine package directory; it imports modules for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the script does not process user input, network data, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining package info, to calling `setup()` with static parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with conditional imports, static metadata, and package configuration. It contains no malicious logic, no network activity, and no data processing that could pose security risks. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
