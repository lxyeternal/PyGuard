  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The provided code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) for packaging the `pysmb` library.\n- It conditionally imports setup functions, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package directories based on Python version.\n- There are no runtime data processing, network operations, or user input handling.\n- The code appears clean, straightforward, and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed observations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The dependencies and URL are typical for a Python package.\n- The code is consistent with a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- All conclude that the script is a typical, benign setup file with no malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data sinks, no untrusted data processing, and no anomalies.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- All reports agree that the code is safe; no issues are identified.\n- The reasoning is consistent and based on static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the analysis.\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score is 0, since the script is purely for packaging and does not perform any runtime operations that could pose a security threat.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign; no changes needed in scoring.\n- Based on the static analysis, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk associated with a setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided setup script is a standard, safe package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
