  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'pysmb' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, os, package metadata fields, install_requires, package_dir, packages",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no execution of untrusted data or network operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily sets configuration data for package installation without data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules and attempts to import 'setuptools' for package setup. It constructs a package directory based on Python version info. The setup() call specifies package metadata, dependencies, and structure. All elements are typical for a Python package distribution and do not include any malicious behavior. No data handling, network communication, or code execution from untrusted sources is present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for publishing a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security concern in this setup script. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
