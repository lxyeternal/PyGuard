  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pysmb' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads system version info, imports setup functions, and defines package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "System info (version) is used internally; no untrusted input flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup functions, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package directories. It does not include any runtime code that handles user input, network communication, or data processing. There are no suspicious or malicious operations detected; it appears to be a standard, well-structured setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign package setup file.",
