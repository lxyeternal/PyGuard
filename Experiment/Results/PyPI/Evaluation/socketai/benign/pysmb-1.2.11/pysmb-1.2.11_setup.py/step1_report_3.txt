{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'pysmb'.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; conditionally imports setup from setuptools or distutils.core; defines package directory and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; setup script does not process untrusted input or handle data streams.",
  "flows": "The script reads system version info to set package directory; defines package metadata and dependencies for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup functions; no unusual code structures or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules, conditionally loads setup tools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It uses sys.version_info to dynamically set package directory, which is standard practice. No external data inputs are processed, and no untrusted data flows are present. The script solely defines packaging information without executing malicious actions or containing suspicious code. Overall, this appears to be a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
