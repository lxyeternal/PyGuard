  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pysmb' Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection, import statements for setup functions, package configuration variables, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external effects; the script primarily configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code appears straightforward for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup functions, determines package directories based on Python version, and calls setup() with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, nor malicious behavior evident. No external network activity or suspicious file operations are present. The code aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
