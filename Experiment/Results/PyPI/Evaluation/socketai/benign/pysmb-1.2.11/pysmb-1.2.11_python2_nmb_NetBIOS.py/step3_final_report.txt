  "purpose": "Implementation of a UDP-based NetBIOS name and IP resolution client, facilitating network queries for hostname/IP mapping.",
  "sources": "Socket creation, random transaction ID generation, data preparation functions, and network send/receive operations.",
  "sinks": "Socket sendto method transmitting data to specified IP and port; recvfrom receiving network responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket sendto with prepared query data to network; responses are received via recvfrom and processed for matching transaction IDs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated exception syntax (`except select.error, ex:`); missing imports (`types`, `errno`); no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets; standard transaction ID handling.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a UDP socket, optionally in broadcast mode, and performs network queries for NetBIOS names and IPs. It uses random transaction IDs to match responses, employs select for waiting, and handles socket errors. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Minor syntax issues are present but do not impact security. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a NetBIOS UDP client for name/IP resolution. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the network operations involved. Minor syntax warnings are noted but do not affect security. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
