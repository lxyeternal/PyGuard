  "conclusion": "The dependency shows suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution and obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The current scores are justified and reflect a moderate security risk. Further runtime analysis and source code review focusing on dynamic execution paths and input validation are recommended to clarify the threat level."
