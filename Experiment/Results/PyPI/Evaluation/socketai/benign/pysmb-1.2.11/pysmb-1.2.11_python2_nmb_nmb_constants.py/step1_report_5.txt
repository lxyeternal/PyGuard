{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to NetBIOS ports, node types, name types, and session packet types for use in network communication or protocols involving NetBIOS.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for network ports, node types, name types, and session packet types related to NetBIOS protocol. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. The constants serve as configuration or protocol identifiers and do not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger application, but by itself, it shows no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions related to NetBIOS protocol parameters. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security risks present. It is likely a utility module for network communication and protocol handling.",
