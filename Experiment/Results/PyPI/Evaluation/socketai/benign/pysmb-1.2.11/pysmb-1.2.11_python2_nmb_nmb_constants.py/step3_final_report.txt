{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to NetBIOS protocol ports, node types, name types, and session packet types for use in network protocol implementations.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static definitions without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions for NetBIOS protocol parameters, including port numbers, node types, name types, and session packet types. No functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code are present. The constants align with standard protocol specifications. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is purely definitional, serving as configuration or protocol constants in a larger system. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are justified based on the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of protocol constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's static nature. No further action is necessary.",
