  "purpose": "Define constants related to NetBIOS services and session packet types for network communication and protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and mappings, no external data input or reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code solely contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions for ports, node types, name types, and session packet types used in NetBIOS protocol implementation. It provides mappings and constants for use in network communication code. There are no functions, input/output handling, or data processing logic present that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a configuration or protocol constants module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining protocol-related constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
