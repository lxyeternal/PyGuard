  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is static, only defining constants related to NetBIOS protocols.\n- No data processing, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static nature.\n- The security risk is also consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code only declares constants; no code executes or processes data.\n   - No embedded network calls, backdoors, or command execution mechanisms.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Errors or Flaws in Logic:**\n   - The reports do not identify any logical errors; the constants seem correct and well-defined.\n   - The mappings and constants align with standard NetBIOS protocol definitions.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the static, benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities based solely on static constants.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the nature of the code, no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely definitional, safe, and has no security implications.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious behavior, static constants only                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Clear, straightforward definitions                               |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities, no data processing or external interactions |\n\nThis code fragment is safe, benign, and suitable for use as a configuration or constants module in a larger network protocol implementation.",
