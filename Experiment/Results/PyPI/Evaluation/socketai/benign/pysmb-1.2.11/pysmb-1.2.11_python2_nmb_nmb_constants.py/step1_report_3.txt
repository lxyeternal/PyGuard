{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to NetBIOS name service ports, owner node types, name types, and session packet types for use in network communication.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows; constants are simply assigned values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed; the code is straightforward definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for network ports, node types, name types, and session packet types. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no data handling, and no suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, no embedded network calls, no obfuscation, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as configuration or constants for a larger network-related module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a static set of constant definitions for NetBIOS protocol parameters. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is benign and unlikely to be part of any malicious activity.",
