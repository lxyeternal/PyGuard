{
  "purpose": "Define constants related to NetBIOS name service, session service, owner node types, name types, and session packet types for network communication.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned static values; no data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations are present that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and a dictionary mapping. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. The constants pertain to well-known network ports, node types, name types, and session packet types used in NetBIOS and related protocols. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident from this static declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely definitional, setting network-related constants for use elsewhere. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and does not exhibit obfuscation. It is safe to use as a reference for network protocol implementation.",
