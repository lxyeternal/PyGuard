{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to NetBIOS ports, node types, name types, and session packet types for network communication.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; constants are hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted destinations; code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions related to NetBIOS networking protocols. No functions, input handling, data processing, or external communication code is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor mechanisms. The constants appear to serve as protocol identifiers and configuration parameters for network operations. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or sensitive data handling indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of protocol-related constants with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign network utility or library.",
