  "purpose": "Encode and decode names according to RFC 1001, involving string manipulation and optional scope handling.",
  "sources": "Input name, type, and scope parameters; internal string and regex operations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed internally within functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through encoding/decoding functions; no external data flow or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'string' module functions (e.g., string.ljust, string.uppercase, string.split); fixed length assumption in decode_name with assertion 'name_length == 32' which could cause errors if input malformed, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RFC 1001 name encoding and decoding, with straightforward logic. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of deprecated 'string' module functions indicates Python 2 style, but does not impact security. The fixed length assertion in decoding could lead to runtime errors if input data is malformed, but this is a robustness concern, not a security flaw. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The functions serve protocol-specific purposes, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, protocol-compliant implementation of name encoding/decoding with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score should be 0 given the benign nature. Minor deprecated practices do not constitute security risks. No modifications are necessary beyond modernization for Python 3 compatibility.",
