{
  "purpose": "Encode and decode names according to RFC 1001 (Section 4), likely for network or protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'name', 'type', 'scope' for encode_name; 'name' for decode_name.",
  "sinks": "String manipulations and regex replacements; no external data output or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (name, scope) flows through encoding/decoding functions with transformations, but no external data sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for encoding/decoding, manipulation of data based on string operations, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The code appears to perform standard encoding/decoding as per protocol, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs encoding and decoding based on RFC 1001, including bitwise operations, string transformations, and handling of scope. The functions utilize standard library features (string, re) for transformations. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors are evident. The code's logic appears consistent with its described purpose, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard encoding and decoding functions for protocol compliance, with no indication of malicious or sabotage behavior. It does not exhibit malicious intent, malware, or security risks beyond normal encoding operations.",
