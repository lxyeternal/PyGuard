{
  "purpose": "The code encodes and decodes names following RFC 1001 specifications, likely for network or protocol handling purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'scope' for encoding; 'name' for decoding.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally; no direct data sinks such as file writes or network transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (name, scope) is transformed through encoding and decoding functions, with regex and string operations, but no external data flow or untrusted output points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The use of regex for encoding/decoding is standard for such transformations. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform name encoding and decoding per RFC standards, utilizing string manipulations, regex substitutions, and assertions. No dynamic code execution, external system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic appears straightforward, focused solely on data encoding/decoding with no malicious intent. The use of assertions is safe here as they verify data integrity, not malicious triggers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of name encoding/decoding routines for network protocol purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
