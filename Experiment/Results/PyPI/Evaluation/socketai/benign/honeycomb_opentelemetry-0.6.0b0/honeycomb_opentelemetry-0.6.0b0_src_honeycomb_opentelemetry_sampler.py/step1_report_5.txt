  "purpose": "Configure and implement a deterministic sampling strategy for OpenTelemetry traces based on a configurable sample rate.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class constructor parameters (options, rate), input parameters to should_sample method (parent_context, trace_id, name, attributes, links, trace_state).",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily performs sampling logic and attribute modification without external data output.",
  "flows": "Configuration of sampler from options -> creation of DeterministicSampler -> should_sample method modifies attributes -> uses internal sampler logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The sampling logic appears standard; no malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sampler configuration function and a DeterministicSampler class that uses predefined OpenTelemetry samplers (ALWAYS_OFF, ALWAYS_ON, TraceIdRatioBased). The class appends a 'SampleRate' attribute to span attributes, which is a common practice for trace filtering or analytics. The sampling logic is based solely on the provided rate and does not include external data access or network communication. The code appears to implement standard sampling functionality without hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a straightforward, non-malicious sampling mechanism for OpenTelemetry traces. It does not exhibit any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The logic is consistent with common telemetry practices, and no security risks are apparent.",
