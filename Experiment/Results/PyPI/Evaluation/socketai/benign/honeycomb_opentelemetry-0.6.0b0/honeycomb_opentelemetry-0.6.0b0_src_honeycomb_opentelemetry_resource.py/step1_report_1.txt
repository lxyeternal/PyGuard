  "purpose": "Create and configure an OpenTelemetry resource with specific attributes for Honeycomb telemetry integration.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'options' parameter (options.service_name, options.service_version) and the platform module (platform.python_version()).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Uses input from 'options' and 'platform.python_version()' to create resource attributes, which are then used to instantiate a Resource object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard library and external packages without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and external libraries for telemetry resource creation. It constructs a dictionary with service and runtime attributes, leveraging provided options and the Python version. No data is sent over the network, no environment variables are accessed insecurely, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The function appears to perform a typical resource setup for telemetry purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for telemetry resource creation. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply constructs resource attributes for observability purposes without any suspicious activity.",
