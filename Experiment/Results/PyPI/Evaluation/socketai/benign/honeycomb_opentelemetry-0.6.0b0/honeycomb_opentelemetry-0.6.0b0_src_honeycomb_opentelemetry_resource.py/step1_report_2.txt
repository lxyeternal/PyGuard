  "purpose": "Configure and create an OpenTelemetry Resource with specific attributes for Honeycomb telemetry.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the platform module (platform.python_version()), and from the options parameter (options.service_name, options.service_version).",
  "sinks": "Creates a Resource object with attributes that may be used in telemetry data; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data from options (user input/configuration) flows into resource attributes, and platform.python_version() provides runtime info; these are used to create a Resource object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library and well-known packages.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a resource with attributes including service name, version, and runtime Python version. It leverages standard libraries and well-known SDKs. No suspicious data handling, no network activity, or malicious logic are evident. The purpose is benign, related to telemetry configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for telemetry setup, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
