  "purpose": "Configure and create an OpenTelemetry Resource with specific attributes for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'options' parameter (options.service_name, options.service_version), and from imported modules (__version__, platform.python_version()).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data externally or write to files; it only creates and returns a Resource object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'options' and imported module variables into the 'attributes' dictionary, which is then used to create the Resource.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of 'platform.python_version()' is standard. No obfuscated or malicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and specific components from external libraries. It constructs an 'attributes' dictionary with service details and runtime version, then creates an OpenTelemetry Resource. No user input, external network calls, or data exfiltration observed. No suspicious behaviors, such as malicious data handling or external communications. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with typical telemetry setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for setting up telemetry resource attributes. No malicious behavior detected, and no security risks evident from this snippet.",
