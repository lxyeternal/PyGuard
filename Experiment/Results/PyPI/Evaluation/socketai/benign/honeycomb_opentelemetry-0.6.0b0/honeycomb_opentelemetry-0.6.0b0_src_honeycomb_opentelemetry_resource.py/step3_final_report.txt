  "purpose": "Create and configure an OpenTelemetry resource with attributes derived from provided options and system info.",
  "sources": "options.service_name, options.service_version, __version__, platform.python_version()",
  "sinks": "None; code does not send data externally or handle untrusted input beyond assigning attributes",
  "flows": "Input options and system info are used to set resource attributes; no external data flow or transmission occurs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and SDK components, constructs a dictionary of attributes from options and system info, and creates a Resource object. It performs straightforward data assignment without network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The input data is limited to options and system version, both benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for telemetry resource creation, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified.",
