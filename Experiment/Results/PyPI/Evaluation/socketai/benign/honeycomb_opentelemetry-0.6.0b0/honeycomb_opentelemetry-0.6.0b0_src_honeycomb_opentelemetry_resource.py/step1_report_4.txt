  "purpose": "Create and configure an OpenTelemetry Resource with specific attributes for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.python_version() (reads Python runtime version), options (input parameter providing service_name, service_version)",
  "sinks": "None directly in the code; no data is transmitted or written outside the process",
  "flows": "Input options -> attributes dictionary -> Resource.create(attributes)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no unusual or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code initializes resource attributes using input options and runtime info, then creates a Resource object. It uses standard libraries and a well-known OpenTelemetry SDK, with no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. The only external info fetched is the Python version, which is benign. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for monitoring setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard resource configuration for telemetry collection without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
