{
  "purpose": "Create and configure an OpenTelemetry Resource with specific attributes, including service name, version, and runtime version.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'options' parameter (specifically options.service_name and options.service_version) and system information via platform.python_version()",
  "sinks": "Uses the attributes dictionary to create a Resource object, which could potentially be misused if the attributes contain malicious input",
  "flows": "Input from options (service name and optional version) flows into the attributes dictionary, combined with runtime version info, then used to create a Resource",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs resource attributes for OpenTelemetry using provided options and system info. It safely uses provided data without suspicious operations. No data leaks, injections, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The use of platform.python_version() is standard and safe. No network operations, file modifications, or system disruptions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for configuring telemetry resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
