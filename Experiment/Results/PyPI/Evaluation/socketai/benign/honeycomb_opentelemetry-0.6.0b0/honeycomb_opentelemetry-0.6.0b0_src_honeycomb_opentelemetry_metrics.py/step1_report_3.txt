  "purpose": "Configure and create a MeterProvider for exporting metrics telemetry to Honeycomb or other endpoints.",
  "sources": "Options object providing endpoint, credentials, headers, protocol, and debug flag; resource parameter for the MeterProvider.",
  "sinks": "Metrics data exported via gRPC or HTTP protocols; console output in debug mode.",
  "flows": "Options provide endpoint, credentials, headers, and protocol → exporter setup (gRPC or HTTP) → data sent to exporter → metrics read periodically → optional console output in debug mode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns; standard use of OpenTelemetry SDK and exporters.",
  "analysis": "The code configures a metrics exporter based on provided options, choosing between gRPC and HTTP protocols, and optionally includes console debugging. No suspicious code or hidden behaviors are evident. It handles data flow from configuration inputs to telemetry output without any obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code performs expected setup routines for telemetry export and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration for telemetry metrics with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It safely creates a MeterProvider based on user options, with no evident backdoors, secret exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.",
