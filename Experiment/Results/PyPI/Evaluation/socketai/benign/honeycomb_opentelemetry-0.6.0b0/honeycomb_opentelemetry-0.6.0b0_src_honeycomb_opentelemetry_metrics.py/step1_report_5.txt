  "purpose": "Configure and create a MeterProvider for sending metrics telemetry to specified endpoints, supporting gRPC and HTTP protocols.",
  "sources": "options.get_metrics_endpoint(), options.get_metrics_endpoint_credentials(), options.get_metrics_headers()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data, but the endpoints and headers could be malicious if provided maliciously",
  "flows": "Options methods provide endpoint, credentials, headers -> exporter uses these to send data to external metrics service",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard configuration for telemetry metrics. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up telemetry metrics export based on provided options. It retrieves endpoint URLs, credentials, and headers dynamically. The protocol (gRPC or HTTP) is chosen based on options. The data is sent via standard exporters; no data processing or handling of untrusted input beyond endpoint configuration. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code detected. It appears to be legitimate configuration code for telemetry with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for telemetry metrics exporting, with dynamic configuration based on user-provided options. No malicious behavior or sabotage identified. It is safe and typical for observability setup.",
