  "sources": "options.get_metrics_endpoint(), options.get_metrics_endpoint_credentials(), options.get_metrics_headers()",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints specified by options.get_metrics_endpoint() when exporting metrics, console output if debugging is enabled",
  "flows": "Source inputs from options influence the creation of exporters; exporters send data to specified network endpoints; optional console exporter logs data locally",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; dynamic selection of protocol and optional console logging are standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code creates metric exporters based on user-provided options, including endpoint URLs, credentials, and headers. It conditionally uses gRPC or HTTP protocols, and adds a console exporter if debugging is enabled. All data flows involve sending telemetry data to user-specified endpoints. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code properly manages optional debugging output, which is a common development practice. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious actions. The code's functionality aligns with typical telemetry setup without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration for setting up metrics telemetry with optional debugging. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It securely uses user-supplied parameters to configure network endpoints and credentials, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows.",
