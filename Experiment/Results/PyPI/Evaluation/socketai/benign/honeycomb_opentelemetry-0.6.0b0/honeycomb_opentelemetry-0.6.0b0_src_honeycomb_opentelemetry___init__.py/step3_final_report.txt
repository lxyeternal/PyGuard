All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these imports, with high confidence and appropriate scores. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is standard configuration code for observability setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
