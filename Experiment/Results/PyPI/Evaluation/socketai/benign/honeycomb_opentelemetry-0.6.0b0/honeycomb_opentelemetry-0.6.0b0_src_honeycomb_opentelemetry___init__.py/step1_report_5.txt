  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leakage points",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code only imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected in import statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements for specific modules related to Honeycomb's OpenTelemetry setup. There are no function calls, data processing, or other logic that could indicate malicious activity. Importing known libraries for observability is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only imports modules related to Honeycomb's OpenTelemetry configuration. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
