  "purpose": "Importing configuration functions and options for Honeycomb OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from honeycomb.opentelemetry.distro and honeycomb.opentelemetry.options modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling; only imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code only contains import statements with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing specific modules related to Honeycomb's OpenTelemetry distribution and options. These are standard import statements for instrumentation setup. There is no indication of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The imports suggest subsequent configuration steps, but the snippet itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import of modules necessary for Honeycomb OpenTelemetry configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
