  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'honeycomb-opentelemetry' package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The package name 'honeycomb-opentelemetry' accessed via pkg_resources.get_distribution()",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only reads package metadata, no data output or network interactions",
  "flows": "Source (package metadata) to variable assignment (__version__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of pkg_resources for version retrieval, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and retrieves the version of the specified package. This is a common pattern for dynamically obtaining package version information. The code does not perform any data input/output, network activity, or malicious operations. It solely reads package metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign snippet used to programmatically access the version of a package. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
