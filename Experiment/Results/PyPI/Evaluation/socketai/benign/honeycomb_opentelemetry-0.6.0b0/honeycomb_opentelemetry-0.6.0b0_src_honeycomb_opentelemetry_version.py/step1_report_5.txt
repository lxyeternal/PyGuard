  "purpose": "The code retrieves the installed version of the 'honeycomb-opentelemetry' package.",
  "sources": "The package manager's installed distribution data for 'honeycomb-opentelemetry'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from retrieving package information via pkg_resources to assigning the version string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of pkg_resources to get package version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' to access package metadata. It then retrieves the version of the 'honeycomb-opentelemetry' package and assigns it to __version__. This is a common practice for versioning in Python packages. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is minimal and standard for package version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of obtaining package version information. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
