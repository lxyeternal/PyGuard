{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and set the version information of the 'honeycomb-opentelemetry' package.",
  "sources": "The package distribution information accessed via pkg_resources.get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; only setting a variable.",
  "flows": "The distribution version info flows from the package metadata to the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of pkg_resources to access package metadata. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources to retrieve the version of the specified package and assigns it to __version__. This is a common pattern for versioning and does not involve user input, network operations, or dangerous code constructs. The use of pkg_resources.get_distribution is standard in Python packaging and dependency management. No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version retrieval pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for version tracking.",
