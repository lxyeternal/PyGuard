  "purpose": "Configure and initialize an OpenTelemetry TracerProvider with exporters, span processors, and optional local visualization based on external configuration options.",
  "sources": "External options providing endpoints, credentials, headers, and flags for exporter protocol, debug mode, and local visualization.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints for trace data (gRPC or HTTP), console output for debug traces, and local visualization exporters.",
  "flows": "Options supply endpoints, credentials, and headers; these flow into exporter constructors, which then send trace data over the network or to local exporters, processed by span processors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Sensitive data is sourced externally, following best practices.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OpenTelemetry setup patterns, dynamically configuring exporters based on external options. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. Credentials and endpoints are externalized, reducing risk of hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The data flow is typical for telemetry collection, with optional local and debug exporters. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external configuration handling, which is common and not inherently insecure. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard telemetry configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
