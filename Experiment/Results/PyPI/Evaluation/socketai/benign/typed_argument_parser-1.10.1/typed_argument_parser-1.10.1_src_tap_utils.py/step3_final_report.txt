  "purpose": "Utility functions for version control, source code inspection, serialization, and argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Subprocess commands (git), inspect.getsource, tokenize source code, pickle serialization/deserialization, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_output, pickle.dumps and pickle.loads, JSON encoding/decoding with custom hooks.",
  "flows": "External commands executed via subprocess, data serialized/deserialized with pickle, source code tokenization for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization/deserialization, which can execute arbitrary code if untrusted data is processed; source code tokens analyzed for structure.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for source code analysis, version control info, and serialization. Use of subprocess commands is controlled; pickle serialization/deserialization is potentially risky if untrusted data is involved, but no active malicious payloads are evident. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The potential security concern is the inherent risk in pickle operations, which could be exploited if misused, but within this context, appears controlled and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with inherent risks associated with pickle serialization. No malicious intent or supply chain sabotage is detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent risks of pickle but is consistent with controlled usage.",
