{
  "purpose": "The code defines command-line argument parsing for configuring an RNN model, including parameters like type, hidden size, and dropout.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments via argparse.ArgumentParser() and Tap library parsing.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code prints values and calls a simple function with these arguments.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line args flows into functions like add_one() without any untrusted data reaching critical sinks such as network, files, or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. Usage of third-party libraries (argparse, tap) is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs argument parsing with standard libraries. It reads input parameters, processes them with simple functions, and prints outputs. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or execute untrusted code. Both argument parsing methods are standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and argument parsing setup with no signs of malware or security risks. It simply reads arguments, processes them with basic functions, and outputs values. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
