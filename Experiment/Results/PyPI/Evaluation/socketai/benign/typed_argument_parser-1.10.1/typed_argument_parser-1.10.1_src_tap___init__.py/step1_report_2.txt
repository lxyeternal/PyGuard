{
  "purpose": "Define and export a typed argument parser module with version info and import dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'argparse' modules and 'tap' package components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard argparse exceptions and components from the 'tap' package, then defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process user input, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for an argument parser utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that imports standard libraries and packages, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
