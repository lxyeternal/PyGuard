{
  "purpose": "The code provides various image processing functions such as rotation, flipping, cropping, scaling, and keypoint manipulations, likely intended for data augmentation or preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data from tensors representing images or keypoints, passed as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through transformation functions (rotation, flip, crop, scale, keypoint adjustments) without external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The functions perform standard image and keypoint manipulations with no hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common image processing operations using PyTorch. It includes functions for image rotations, flips, cropping, resizing, scaling, and keypoint transformations, all based solely on tensor manipulations. No external system calls, network activity, or suspicious behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, command execution) are present. The code appears clean, well-structured, and typical for data augmentation in ML pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of image and keypoint manipulation functions with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is consistent with standard image preprocessing routines and poses no security risk.",
