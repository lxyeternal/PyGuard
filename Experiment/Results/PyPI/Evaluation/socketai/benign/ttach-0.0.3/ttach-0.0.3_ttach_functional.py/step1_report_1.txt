{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of image transformation functions for augmentations, including rotations, flips, cropping, scaling, and keypoint manipulations, likely intended for data preprocessing in machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads tensor data from input parameters such as x, keypoints, and crop parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through transformation functions to output tensors; keypoint transformations also process tensor coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious function behavior; all functions perform straightforward tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard image and keypoint transformation functions with clear, well-defined operations. No network activity, file operations, or environment variable usage suggest malicious intent. Functions perform tensor manipulations such as rotation, flipping, cropping, scaling, and keypoint adjustments, all in a typical manner. No code injection, data leakage, or hidden behavior observed. The functions are typical for data augmentation in computer vision tasks, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of image transformation utilities for data augmentation, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage. It is safe and intended for legitimate use in machine learning workflows.",
