{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for image manipulation and keypoint transformations, likely for data augmentation or preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it operates on tensors passed as parameters, which are expected to be image batches or keypoints.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, files, or network, and does not contain any suspicious data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors (images or keypoints) through transformation functions like flip, rotate, crop, scale, etc., but no untrusted data is directed towards sensitive sinks or external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, purely mathematical or tensor operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of functions performing image transformations and keypoint adjustments. All functions operate on tensors with well-defined tensor operations. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communications, file manipulations, or secret data handling. The keypoint functions include valid geometric transformations with proper input validation for rotation parameter. The code is well-structured, consistent with data augmentation utilities, and lacks any suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image and keypoint transformation utility module for data preprocessing. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code. It is safe and intended for typical machine learning workflows.",
