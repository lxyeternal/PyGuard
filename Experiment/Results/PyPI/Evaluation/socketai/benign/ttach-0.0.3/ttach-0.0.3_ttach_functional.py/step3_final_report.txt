  "purpose": "Provides image and keypoint transformation utilities for data augmentation in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs representing images and keypoints; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network connections, or file operations; all data flows within tensor transformations.",
  "flows": "Transformations from source tensors to augmented tensors via rotations, flips, crops, and rescaling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard image and keypoint augmentation functions using PyTorch. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. Functions perform predictable tensor operations such as rotation, flipping, cropping, and scaling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and typical for data preprocessing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard set of data augmentation utilities suitable for use in machine learning workflows. The security risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as 0, and obfuscation is absent. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
