{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for image augmentation, manipulation, and keypoint transformations in a neural network context, primarily using PyTorch.",
  "sources": "The code reads input tensors (images, keypoints) via function parameters; no external data sources or untrusted input sources are explicitly invoked.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or operations that send data externally, access sensitive data, or perform network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The functions process image tensors and keypoints, transforming them through rotations, flips, scaling, cropping, and keypoint adjustments within local tensor operations; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; all functions are standard image processing utilities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward image augmentation functions and keypoint transformations. These are typical in computer vision workflows. The functions perform rotations, flips, scaling, cropping, and keypoint coordinate adjustments without any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are apparent. The code is clean, well-structured, and consistent with common data augmentation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard image and keypoint transformation utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in image processing pipelines, with no indication of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is negligible.",
