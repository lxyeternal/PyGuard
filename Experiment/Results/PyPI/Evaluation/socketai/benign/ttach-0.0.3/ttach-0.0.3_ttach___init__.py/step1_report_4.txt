{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and classes related to image processing, augmentation, and model wrappers, likely for a computer vision project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .wrappers, .base, .transforms, and .aliases.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or untrusted external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code loads class definitions and functions from local modules; these are used for processing but do not appear to handle untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All imports are standard for a modular Python project.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. It does not include dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of external inputs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import structure for a computer vision project, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is standard and appears safe.",
