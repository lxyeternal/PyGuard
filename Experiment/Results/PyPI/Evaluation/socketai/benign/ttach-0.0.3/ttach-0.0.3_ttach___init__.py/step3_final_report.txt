{
  "purpose": "Import statements for image augmentation and model wrapper classes from local modules, setting up dependencies for a computer vision project.",
  "sources": "Local modules: .wrappers, .base, .transforms, and aliases, which provide classes and functions for image transformations and model wrappers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports classes and functions without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes and functions into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond module loading occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to image processing and model wrappers. There are no data flows, dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated patterns. The code's purpose is to set up dependencies, and it does not perform any malicious or risky actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for a machine learning or computer vision library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
