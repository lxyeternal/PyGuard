  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to image processing, augmentation, and model wrappers.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippet matches the described purpose: importing classes and functions for image transformations and wrappers.\n- The logical reasoning in each report is sound; the code is standard and benign.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is consistent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which makes sense given the clarity of the code.\n\n**Score Justifications:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements with no execution or external interactions, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment; no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is safe, standard, and benign.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, safe import module for an image processing or machine learning project, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
