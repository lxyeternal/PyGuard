{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project, including upload functionality to PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements.txt, README.md, and __version__.py files; user input via system commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to execute shell commands for building and uploading packages, and for git tagging and pushing.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and files; then calls os.system() with commands to build, upload, and push tags, passing strings to the shell.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; uses standard setup tools and commands. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup.py script with a custom upload command class that manages build and upload operations via system calls. It reads package metadata, dependencies, and version info from files, then executes shell commands for distribution tasks. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. The use of os.system() is standard for such scripts but does pose a minor security risk if manipulated externally; however, in this context, it appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with upload capabilities. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. It primarily automates packaging and publishing tasks without suspicious logic.",
