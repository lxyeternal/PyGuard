{
  "purpose": "A standard Python setup.py script for packaging and uploading a Python project, including custom commands for build and deployment.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from requirements.txt, version info from __version__.py, and README.md for long description; executes shell commands via os.system() for build, upload, and git tagging.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing build, upload, and git commands.",
  "flows": "External files are read for configuration; shell commands are executed based on these configurations; no user input is processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() without input sanitization; reliance on external files; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup utility for Python packages, performing build and upload operations. It reads configuration data from static files and executes shell commands for deployment. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the use of os.system() without sanitization, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, inputs are static and controlled. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting cautiousness due to command execution but consistent with standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The primary concern is the use of os.system() without sanitization, which is typical for such scripts given the static nature of inputs. The scores are appropriately low, indicating minimal risk and no malicious activity.",
