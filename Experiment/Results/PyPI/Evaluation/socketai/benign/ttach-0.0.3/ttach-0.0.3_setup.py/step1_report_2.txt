{
  "purpose": "This script automates the packaging, distribution, and upload process for a Python project, including building distributions and pushing to PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description, and the '__version__.py' file for version info. It also executes system commands for building and uploading the package.",
  "sinks": "System commands via os.system() for building and uploading packages, and git commands for tagging and pushing releases.",
  "flows": "File reading sources ('requirements.txt', 'README.md', '__version__.py') feed into variables used during setup; os.system() calls execute shell commands that perform build, upload, and git push operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() for executing build/upload and git commands; no explicit validation or sanitization of inputs before executing shell commands. No hardcoded credentials are visible. The script is a typical setup helper with no obvious malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package setup and distribution. It reads dependency and version information from files and defines a custom command to automate build and upload processes. The use of os.system() executes shell commands for uploading to PyPI and pushing git tags, which is standard but could be risky if inputs were untrusted. However, the inputs are static file reads and internal variables, not user inputs or external data, reducing risk. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. The only noteworthy aspect is the reliance on os.system(), which is common in setup scripts but can be dangerous if misused, though here it appears safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It automates package publishing tasks without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
