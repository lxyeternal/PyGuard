  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The primary concern is the use of os.system() without sanitization, which is typical for such scripts given the static nature of inputs. The scores are appropriately low, indicating minimal risk and no malicious activity."
