  "purpose": "The script automates package setup, building, and uploading to PyPI, including version management and distribution commands.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt, README.md, __version__.py, and package metadata files; user input via commands; environment variables for sys.executable.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands with os.system() for build, upload, and git operations.",
  "flows": "File reads for configuration and version info -> user invokes 'upload' command -> os.system calls for build, upload, and git tagging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() for executing shell commands, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated. No hardcoded secrets detected, but the command execution could be misused if inputs are tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package distribution processes. It reads configuration files and executes shell commands for building and uploading packages. The use of os.system() introduces potential command injection if external inputs are compromised, but in this context, the inputs are controlled and not dynamically constructed from untrusted sources. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code structure and logic are typical for setup scripts, with no obfuscated code or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup and upload utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. Its primary security concern is the reliance on os.system(), which could be risky if misused, but under normal circumstances, it appears safe.",
