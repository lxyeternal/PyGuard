{
  "purpose": "Define a set of image transformation classes for data augmentation and deaugmentation, including flips, rotations, scaling, resizing, and cropping.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (functools, typing) and local modules (.functional as F, .base). Class methods and constructors reading parameters for transformations.",
  "sinks": "apply_aug_image, apply_deaug_mask, apply_deaug_label, apply_deaug_keypoints methods performing image manipulations; potential data modifications, but no untrusted data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Transformation parameters flow from class constructors into apply methods, which process images, masks, labels, and keypoints accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual runtime behavior. The code uses straightforward data transformations. No hidden or obfuscated code patterns. No network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple image transformation classes, each designed for specific augmentation tasks, utilizing functions from the imported F module. All operations are standard image manipulations like flip, rotate, scale, resize, add, multiply, and crop. The constructors accept parameters for flexibility, but do not include any malicious logic. There are no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity or system modification. The 'FiveCrops' class explicitly states it raises errors for masks and keypoints, indicating limited applicability. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, standard for image augmentation, and contains no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of safe, standard image transformation classes for data augmentation purposes. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The implementation appears legitimate and intended solely for image processing tasks.",
