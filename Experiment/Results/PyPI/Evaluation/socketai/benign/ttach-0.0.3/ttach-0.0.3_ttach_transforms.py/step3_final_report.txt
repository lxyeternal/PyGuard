{
  "purpose": "Defines image augmentation classes for flipping, rotating, scaling, resizing, cropping, and basic pixel operations.",
  "sources": "Input images, masks, labels, keypoints, and parameters such as angles, scales, sizes, and values.",
  "sinks": "Functions in module F performing image transformations; data remains in-memory, no external network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions like F.hflip, F.vflip, F.rot90, F.scale, F.resize, etc., with parameters controlling transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard image augmentation classes with clear, readable structure. It relies on external functions presumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Data flows are confined to in-memory image processing. No external network or file I/O involved. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of image augmentation techniques with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
