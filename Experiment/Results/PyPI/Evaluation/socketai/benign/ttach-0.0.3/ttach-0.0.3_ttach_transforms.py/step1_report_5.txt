{
  "purpose": "Define various image augmentation and transformation classes for use in image processing pipelines, including flips, rotations, scaling, resizing, and cropping.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; mainly class initializations and method calls for image transformations.",
  "sinks": "Application of transformations like F.scale, F.hflip, F.vflip, F.rot90, F.resize, F.add, F.multiply, and cropping functions. No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Transform parameters flow from class initializations to their respective apply methods, calling functions from the functional module (F) to modify images, masks, labels, keypoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No unusual or obfuscated code patterns. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of cropping functions for data augmentation, which are standard. No dynamic execution or external network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for image transformations commonly used in data augmentation pipelines. The methods perform straightforward image manipulations via functions from the 'F' module, which are assumed to be standard. No code injects untrusted data into system or network calls. No backdoors, system commands, or data exfiltration routines are present. The only potential concern is the use of partial functions for cropping, which is standard. Overall, the code appears to implement legitimate image augmentation functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of image transformation classes for data augmentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on image data, with no external system or network effects. The implementation appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
