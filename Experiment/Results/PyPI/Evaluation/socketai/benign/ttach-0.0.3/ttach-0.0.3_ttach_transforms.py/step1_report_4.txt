{
  "purpose": "Define various image augmentation and transformation classes for image processing pipelines, including flips, rotations, scaling, resizing, and cropping.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, typing, and local modules; class constructors and methods reading parameters; F.* functions for image transformations.",
  "sinks": "F.* functions that perform image manipulations; no apparent data leakage points; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input images and parameters flow into transformation methods, which call F.* functions to modify images, masks, labels, or keypoints. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks identified. The code strictly performs image transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard image augmentation classes, inheriting from DualTransform and ImageOnlyTransform. It utilizes functions from the F module for operations like flip, rotate, scale, resize, add, multiply, and crop. Parameter handling appears straightforward with no suspicious logic. The use of partial functions for cropping is typical. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. All functions seem to perform legitimate image processing tasks, with proper validation where needed, such as size and original size checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured image augmentation classes with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and focused solely on image transformations for data augmentation purposes.",
