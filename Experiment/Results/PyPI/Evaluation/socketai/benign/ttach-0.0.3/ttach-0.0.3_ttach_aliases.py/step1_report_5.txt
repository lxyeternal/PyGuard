{
  "purpose": "Define various image transformation pipelines for data augmentation or preprocessing in a computer vision project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all transformations are created via function calls returning composed operations.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or data sinks that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions simply return composed transformation objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions that return composed image transformations, using a presumably external 'tta' module for augmentation methods like flips, rotations, scaling, and cropping. No input/output handling, environment variable usage, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions are typical in data augmentation contexts and do not exhibit malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for image augmentation pipelines with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and intended for preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
