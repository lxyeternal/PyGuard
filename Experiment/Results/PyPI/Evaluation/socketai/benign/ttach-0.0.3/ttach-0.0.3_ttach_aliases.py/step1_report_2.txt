{
  "purpose": "Define various image transformation pipelines for data augmentation or preprocessing in a computer vision context.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses function parameters for crop sizes, scales, and interpolation methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; transformations are constructed and returned as objects.",
  "flows": "Functions return Compose objects that encapsulate transformations; no data flows or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions returning composed image transformations using the 'tta' module. It includes flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping transforms, which are typical in data augmentation. No external data is read directly, nor are there sinks or data leaks. The code structure and syntax are normal, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It appears to be a standard implementation for image augmentation pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of image transformation functions for data augmentation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical utility module with no malicious behavior.",
