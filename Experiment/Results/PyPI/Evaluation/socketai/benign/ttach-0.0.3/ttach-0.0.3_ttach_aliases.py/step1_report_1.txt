  "purpose": "Define data augmentation transformations for image processing, such as flips, rotations, scaling, and cropping.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; functions create transformation pipelines for images.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only constructs and returns transformation objects.",
  "flows": "Function calls generate transformation objects; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with typical image augmentation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines functions that return composed image transformations, such as flips, rotations, scaling, and cropping. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are handled. The functions merely create and return transformation objects using the tta module, with no data processing or external communication. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. The structure is standard for image augmentation pipelines in machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of image augmentation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply constructs and returns transformation objects without handling untrusted data or executing any suspicious operations.",
