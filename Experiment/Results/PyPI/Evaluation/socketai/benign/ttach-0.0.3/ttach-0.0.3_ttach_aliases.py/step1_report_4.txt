{
  "purpose": "Define and compose various image transformation pipelines for data augmentation or preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; uses imported modules and function parameters for image transformation configurations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; functions return composed transformation objects, likely for later use in data pipelines.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into transformation constructors, which are wrapped into Compose objects for downstream processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard image augmentation setup with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports transformation functions and composes them into sequences for image augmentation, including flips, rotations, cropping, and scaling. It is straightforward and uses common image processing patterns. No input validation or data handling beyond parameter passing; no network or file operations observed. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code’s purpose aligns with typical data augmentation workflows in machine learning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for image augmentation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines functions that return transformation pipelines for image data processing.",
