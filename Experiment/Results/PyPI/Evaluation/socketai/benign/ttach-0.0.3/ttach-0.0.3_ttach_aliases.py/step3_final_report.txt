{
  "purpose": "Defines image transformation pipelines for data augmentation in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; functions create transformation objects using the 'tta' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Functions return composed transformation objects; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs image augmentation functions such as flips, rotations, scaling, and cropping. It uses a local module 'tta' to define transformations, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. The functions are typical in data preprocessing pipelines, and no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and the absence of external data or network interactions confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of image augmentation functions with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
