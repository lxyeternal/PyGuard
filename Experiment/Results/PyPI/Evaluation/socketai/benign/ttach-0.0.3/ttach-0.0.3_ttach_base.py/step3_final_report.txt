{
  "purpose": "The code provides a modular framework for image, mask, label, and keypoint transformations used in data augmentation pipelines, primarily for machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Parameters within each transform (params), data passed to apply_* methods, and the product of params in Compose for generating transformation configurations.",
  "sinks": "The apply_* methods could potentially process untrusted data if params are externally supplied; however, no external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Params are bound via 'partial' functions in Compose, then passed to the respective apply_* methods during transformation chains; data flows through these chains during augmentation and de-augmentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external system interactions. Use of 'partial' is standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for transformations, composition, and merging, all structured for data augmentation tasks. No network activity, file operations, or secret handling are present. The use of 'partial' functions for parameter binding is typical in such frameworks. The 'Merger' class performs mathematical operations safely, with no evident malicious intent. The overall structure is clear, modular, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Potential concerns about 'params' being externally controlled are theoretical; no evidence suggests such misuse here. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the potential for misuse if parameters are untrusted, but no actual vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data augmentation framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. It can be considered safe for use in production environments.",
