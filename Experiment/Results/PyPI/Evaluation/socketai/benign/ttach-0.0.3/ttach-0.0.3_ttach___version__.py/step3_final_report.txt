  "purpose": "Define the package version statically for use in the Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a tuple VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external sources or sinks; the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a simple tuple and string join.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple VERSION with version numbers, then creates a string __version__ by joining the tuple elements. It involves no input, no external data, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security risks, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The provided reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
