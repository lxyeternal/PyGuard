  "purpose": "Define the version number of the module or package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, setting a version tuple and a string representation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple named VERSION with three integers representing the version. It then creates a string __version__ by joining the elements of VERSION with dots. This is a common pattern for defining package versions in Python. The code is simple, static, and contains no user input, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
