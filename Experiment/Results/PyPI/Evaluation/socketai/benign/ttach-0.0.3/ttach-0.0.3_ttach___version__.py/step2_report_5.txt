  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version assignment, with no input handling, data leaks, or dynamic behavior. The code is static and standard for defining package versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a typical version declaration pattern, with no logical errors or flawed reasoning. No report overstates or underestimates the security implications.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is static and harmless, there's no justification for higher scores. The risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, obfuscation, or external data handling. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions. They all correctly state that the code is a simple version declaration with no vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis and the code. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, static version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a common, harmless pattern for version declaration.",
