  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment of version tuple",

  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Simple version assignment, no anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets a VERSION tuple with static values (0, 0, 3), then joins these values into a string assigned to __version__. This is a common pattern for defining package version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No external input, code injection, or hidden code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
