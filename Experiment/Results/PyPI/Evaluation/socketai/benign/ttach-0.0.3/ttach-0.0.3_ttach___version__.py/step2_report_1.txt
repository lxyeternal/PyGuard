  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration: defining a tuple `VERSION` and converting it into a string `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The code is static and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is a typical pattern for versioning in Python packages, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. No errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code. Since the code is purely static and standard, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is entirely static, with no input handling, no external data, and no suspicious operations, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The assigned scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's harmless nature. There is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they do not suggest vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the code's simple purpose.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, static version declaration with no dynamic or malicious elements. It poses no security risk, no obfuscation, and no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports and the code's straightforward nature.",
