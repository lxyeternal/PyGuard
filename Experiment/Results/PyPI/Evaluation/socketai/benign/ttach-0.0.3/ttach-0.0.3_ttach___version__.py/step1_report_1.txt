  "flows": "Assignment from VERSION tuple to __version__ string",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple and then converts it to a dot-separated string for __version__. This is a common pattern for specifying package versioning. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external data reads, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
