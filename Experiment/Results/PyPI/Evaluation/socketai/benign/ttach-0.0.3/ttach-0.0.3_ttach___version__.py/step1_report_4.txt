  "purpose": "Define the version number of the software package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded tuple 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Simple version assignment with hardcoded tuple; no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a tuple 'VERSION' with version numbers and then constructs a string '__version__' by joining these numbers with dots. This is a common pattern for defining package versions. No input handling, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines a version string for the package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It poses no security risks.",
