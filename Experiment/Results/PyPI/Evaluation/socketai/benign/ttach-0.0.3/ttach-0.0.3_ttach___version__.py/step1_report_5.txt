  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package",
  "sources": "The assignment of the tuple 'VERSION' and the string '.__version__' derived from it",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "The tuple 'VERSION' is converted to string and assigned to '__version__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles version information",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version tuple, then joins its elements into a string assigned to '__version__'. There are no input sources, no data leaks, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or malicious operations. It is a standard way to define package versioning information.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a typical version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a normal, harmless part of a Python package setup.",
