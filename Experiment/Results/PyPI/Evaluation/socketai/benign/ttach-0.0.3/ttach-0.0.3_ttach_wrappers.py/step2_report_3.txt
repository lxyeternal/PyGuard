  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard TTA wrapper with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The confidence score is high (0.9), and malware is scored at 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The reasoning is consistent with the code provided.\n\n- **Score review:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Security risk is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the wrappers, with no malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no external network activity or obfuscation. The analysis is consistent.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware score of 0 is justified. Security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for TTA wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code involves tensor transformations, model inference, and merging, all standard. No external communication or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware remains at 0, and security risk is low. The confidence is high (1.0), consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—benign TTA wrappers with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's flow is typical for such wrappers. No suspicious patterns or external data leaks.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware score of 0, security risk low, aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports—standard TTA wrappers, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware score of 0, security risk minimal, aligns with the reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Security risks are low across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Potential risks:** None identified. The code is a typical implementation of TTA wrappers.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, standard inference wrappers)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
