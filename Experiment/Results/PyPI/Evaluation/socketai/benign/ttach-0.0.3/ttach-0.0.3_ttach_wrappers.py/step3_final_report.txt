{
  "purpose": "Provides wrapper classes for segmentation, classification, and keypoints models with test time augmentation (TTA), applying augmentations, model inference, and merging outputs.",
  "sources": "Input tensor 'image' and optional model outputs; augmentation and deaugmentation methods within transformers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; in-memory tensor operations only; no network or file system activity.",
  "flows": "Input image -> augmentation -> model inference -> deaugmentation -> merging -> output dictionary (if key specified).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard TTA wrappers for different model types, utilizing augmentation and deaugmentation methods, merging predictions. No external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic observed. The code relies on internal modules and tensor operations, with no suspicious data leaks or backdoors. The structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical ML inference patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of TTA wrappers for PyTorch models, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1). The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
