  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any discrepancies, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides TTA wrappers for segmentation, classification, and keypoints models, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It assigns malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code indeed contains classes for segmentation, classification, and keypoints TTA wrappers, matching the description.\n\n- **Logical Flaws / Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation. The code uses standard libraries and internal modules.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — somewhat low but possibly considering the external transformers and merging logic.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — aligns with the thorough review.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard TTA wrappers, no malicious behavior, with malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The classes and logic match the description.\n\n- **Anomalies / Flaws:** No suspicious activity, no external network calls, no obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is standard for TTA wrappers, with no malicious behavior, malware score 0, security risk 0.0, confidence 1.0.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** Matches the code structure.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Fully consistent; zero malware, zero security risk.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard TTA wrappers, no malicious activity, malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code aligns with the description.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, standard design, no malicious behavior, malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** Matches the code.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no external calls.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, consistent with the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.0 to 0.2), generally low, justified by the code's nature.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting thorough review.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of TTA wrappers for different model types in PyTorch.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The transformers are external, but their usage here appears benign.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- The merging logic is straightforward and typical for such applications.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering external transformers, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
