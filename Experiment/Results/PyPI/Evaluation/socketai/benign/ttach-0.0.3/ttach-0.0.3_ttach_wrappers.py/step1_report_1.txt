{
  "purpose": "Provide wrapper classes for applying test-time augmentation (TTA) to segmentation, classification, and keypoints models in PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Input tensors for models, including augmented images and keypoints; output data from models, potentially dicts containing masks, labels, or keypoints.",
  "sinks": "Return values of forward methods, which could be dicts or tensors; potential data leaks if misused or mishandled outside the scope of augmentation.",
  "flows": "Input images are augmented via transformers, passed into models, outputs are deaugmented, and results are merged. Keypoints outputs are reshaped and scaled if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious logic; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior detected. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe dynamic code. No network activity or system manipulation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper classes for different model types, applying test-time augmentation and merging results. Usage of model inputs and outputs appears standard. No malicious functions or data leaks are present. Transformers are used solely for augmentation/deaugmentation, with no indication of data exfiltration or harmful actions. The code structure and logic are typical for TTA wrappers and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard TTA wrappers without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and designed solely for augmenting model predictions during inference. No signs of malware or malicious behavior detected.",
