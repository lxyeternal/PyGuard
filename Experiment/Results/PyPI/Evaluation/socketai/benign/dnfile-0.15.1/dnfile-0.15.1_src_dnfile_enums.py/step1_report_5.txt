{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations and classes related to .NET CLR metadata and flags, intended for interpreting metadata attributes in managed code analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from enum attributes, class initializations, and bitwise operations within class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data inputs in class constructors (value parameter), which influence attribute flags and enum interpretations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'value' through constructor logic to setting boolean flags and enum attributes, primarily for metadata parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code mainly consists of enum definitions, bitmask operations, and class attribute handling. No network, file, or environment variable interactions present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of classes and enums for parsing and representing metadata attributes in the .NET framework. It uses bitmasking and enum logic to interpret flags from metadata values. All operations are limited to attribute and flag interpretation, with no side-effects, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. No suspicious code, such as network calls, file access, or environment manipulation, is present. The structure is straightforward and appears intended for static analysis or metadata parsing, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative and designed for interpreting metadata flags and attributes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate utility for .NET metadata analysis. No security risks identified.",
