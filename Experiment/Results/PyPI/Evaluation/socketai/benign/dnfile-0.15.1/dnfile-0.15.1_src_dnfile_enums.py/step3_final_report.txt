{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and enums for interpreting .NET metadata flags and attributes, serving as a static utility library for metadata analysis.",
  "sources": "Static definitions, class initializations, and enum attributes; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; internal flag setting based on input values, with no external data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' propagates through constructor to set internal flags; no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward enum and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, static collection of classes and enums for interpreting .NET assembly metadata. It performs internal flag setting based on input values but does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static library for interpreting .NET metadata attributes, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The current security scores are appropriate and can be maintained.",
