  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured parser for .NET CLR metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. It processes potentially untrusted data with appropriate validation, and the security risk is minimal. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the risk score at 0.2 to account for processing untrusted data but without active threats."
