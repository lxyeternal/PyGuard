  "purpose": "Defines static classes for .NET metadata coded indexes, mapping table references and tag bits.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and type annotations; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for metadata indexing, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. Comments referencing malware sources appear to be generic or template-based, not indicative of malicious intent. The code's purpose is structural, used for referencing metadata tables in .NET assemblies, and it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, metadata-focused nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
