{
  "purpose": "This code defines various classes representing coded index types used for metadata tables in a .NET assembly parsing or analysis context.",
  "sources": "The code imports type hints and class definitions, but does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or network activity. The code appears to be part of a metadata parsing framework.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions for various coded index types used in .NET metadata tables. It imports type hints, defines classes with specific table mappings, and assigns tag bits and table name tuples. There are no apparent data processing, input/output operations, or external communications. The classes serve as data structures for metadata referencing, and do not perform any logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a metadata analysis or parsing library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines data structures without external data handling or execution logic.",
