{
  "purpose": "Defines various coded index classes for .NET metadata tables used in assembly analysis and reflection.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base and conditional typing imports from .mdtable, which reference external table classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and class variable assignments; no data flow from sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for data indexing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines several classes representing coded indices for .NET metadata. The classes inherit from a base class and specify table mappings, tag bits, and table names. The code is well-structured, primarily consisting of static class attributes and type annotations. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or network interactions are present. The comment headers and licensing info do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, structural part of a metadata processing library, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is standard class definition code for managing metadata indices.",
