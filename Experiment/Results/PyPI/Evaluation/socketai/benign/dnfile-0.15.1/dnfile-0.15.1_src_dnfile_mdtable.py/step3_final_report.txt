{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, parsing strategies, and factory methods for .NET metadata tables, facilitating reading and interpreting metadata streams in a safe and structured manner.",
  "sources": "Class properties, internal indices, heap data, and raw binary streams representing metadata rows and blobs.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from binary streams into structured class properties and format descriptions; no external system calls or unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Raw data from binary streams or heaps into class attributes via parsing functions, then into format computation methods for serialization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; the only notable pattern is the 'Unused' placeholder table, which is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation of .NET metadata tables, including parsing strategies, size validations, and a factory method for instantiation. It performs no external communication, code execution, or malicious behavior. The use of size validation functions and structured class definitions indicates careful handling of potentially untrusted data. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose as a safe, declarative data model for metadata parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe, and transparent implementation for handling .NET metadata tables. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the low security risk scores are justified. Overall, it is a benign, well-designed parsing library with minimal security concerns.",
