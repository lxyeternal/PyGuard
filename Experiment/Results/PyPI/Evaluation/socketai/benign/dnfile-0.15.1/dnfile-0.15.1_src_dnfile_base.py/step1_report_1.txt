{
  "purpose": "This code provides base classes and utilities for parsing and handling .NET metadata streams, tables, and heaps within a file analysis context.",
  "sources": "Reads from bytes streams, file offsets, and data provided to methods such as set_data, parse_rows, and class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No functions or code sections write data to external sources, network, or disk.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes streams into internal data structures via set_data, parse_rows, and parse methods; no untrusted external data flows into sensitive sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Usage of cached functions and type assertions appears normal. No dynamic code execution, eval, or similar constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures, abstract base classes, and parsing logic for .NET metadata streams, heaps, and tables. It uses standard Python features, including type annotations, class inheritance, and caching. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is observed. All data flows are confined within parsing and data structure setup. No external network or file system operations are performed. It handles data carefully with bounds checks and logging for invalid data. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for static analysis of PE/.NET files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical static analysis framework for .NET metadata with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses on safe data parsing, lazy loading, and structured data management. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
