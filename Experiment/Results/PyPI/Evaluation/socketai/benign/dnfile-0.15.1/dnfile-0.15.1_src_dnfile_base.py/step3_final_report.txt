{
  "purpose": "The code provides base classes, data structures, and parsing mechanisms for .NET metadata streams, heaps, and tables, primarily used for static analysis or reverse engineering of .NET PE files.",
  "sources": "Bytes streams, heap data, and table data from the PE file, accessed via methods like set_data, parse_rows, and lazy load functions.",
  "sinks": "None; data flows are confined within parsing routines and internal data structures, with no external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from raw bytes into structured objects through parsing functions, with internal references and lazy loading for efficiency.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of standard Python features and caching appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured static analysis framework for .NET PE files, with classes for metadata tables, heaps, and streams. It employs standard parsing techniques, bounds checks, and logging. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The design is typical for reverse engineering tools, focusing on safe, internal data handling without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe static analysis library for .NET metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
