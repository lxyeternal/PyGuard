  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk, while cross-referencing the code and the reports' reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the code:\n- The code defines base classes, data structures, and parsing mechanisms for .NET metadata streams, heaps, and tables.\n- It uses standard Python features: classes, inheritance, caching, type annotations.\n- No dynamic code execution, eval, or obfuscated constructs.\n- Extensive use of logging and bounds checks.\n- Lazy loading is employed for efficiency, not malicious intent.\n- No external network or file operations are present.\n- The code appears to be a static analysis or reverse engineering framework.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Static analysis framework for .NET metadata.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard, safe, and intended for analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Parsing .NET metadata for malware analysis or reverse engineering.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code execution, no suspicious flow, just reverse engineering practices.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (minor, due to potential misuse of parsed data)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior detected; the security risk is minimal and typical for such tools.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Parsing .NET metadata streams/tables.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, standard parsing.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard parser with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Base classes for parsing .NET metadata, possibly for malware analysis.\n- **Findings:** No code injection, remote code execution, or exfiltration; operates on provided data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe, standard, and intended for analysis.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Parsing .NET metadata streams and tables, likely for malware analysis.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical static analysis library, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores:\n- All reports agree on **malware score = 0** — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 in all reports — aligns with the clear, structured code.\n- Security risk is uniformly low (0.2 or 0), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — minimal security risk, typical for static analysis frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — the code is purely structural, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear, well-documented, and uses standard patterns.\n\n**Risk:** 0 — the code is a static analysis framework, with no external dependencies or operations that could pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured framework for parsing .NET metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed reasoning above.",
