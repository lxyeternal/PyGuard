{
  "purpose": "The code is a .NET PE parser designed to extract CLR metadata, resources, and stream information from PE files, primarily for static analysis or reverse engineering purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from PE structures via pefile functions, including get_data, get_string_at_rva, and parse functions, which serve as input sources for parsing CLR headers, metadata, streams, and resources.",
  "sinks": "Processes untrusted PE data into structured objects; no external sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from PE data extraction functions into structured classes (e.g., ClrMetaData, ClrData, streams), with validation and error handling ensuring safe parsing; no malicious or external effects occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected; the code employs standard validation, exception handling, and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured, validated parsing of .NET PE files, extracting CLR headers, metadata, streams, and resources with appropriate error handling. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity. The data flows are typical for static analysis tools, and the code's purpose is benign. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The code's clarity and standard practices support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured .NET PE parser intended for static analysis. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with untrusted data parsing but no active threats.",
