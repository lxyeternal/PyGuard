  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured .NET PE parser intended for static analysis. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with untrusted data parsing but no active threats."
