  "purpose": "Utility functions for data compression, caching with optional shallow copying, and lazy evaluation data structures.",
  "sources": "Input data for compression/decompression functions, cache input parameters, lazy list evaluation triggers.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed in-memory without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into compression/decompression functions; cache decorator stores function outputs; lazy list evaluates items upon access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of copy in cache decorator is unconventional but benign; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for data compression, shallow copying cache decorator, and lazy list implementation. No network activity, external data transmission, or system modifications are present. The functions are well-structured, documented, and use common patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The cache decorator's optional copying could be misused but is not malicious. The lazy list class evaluates items on access, which is a known pattern for performance optimization. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions and classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
