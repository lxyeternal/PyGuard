{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes for error handling, with inheritance from built-in Exception.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external interactions; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data inputs, outputs, or logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, with appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard Python exception class definitions, serving as structural components for error handling. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
