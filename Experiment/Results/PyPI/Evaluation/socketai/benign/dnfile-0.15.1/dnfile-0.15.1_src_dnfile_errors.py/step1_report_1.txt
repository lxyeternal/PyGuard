{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to DNS and resource formatting issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class inheritance without any unusual constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions, dnFormatError and rsrcFormatError (which inherits from dnFormatError). There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to serve a standard error handling purpose within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard class definitions for exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
