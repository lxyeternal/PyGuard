  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is simply defining two custom exception classes with inheritance, with no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, sources, sinks, or suspicious constructs.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a structural component for error handling.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is clearly harmless.\n- No potential vulnerabilities are implied or evident.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign class inheritance structure for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is simple, standard Python exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscating elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0, reflecting the benign nature of this code segment.",
