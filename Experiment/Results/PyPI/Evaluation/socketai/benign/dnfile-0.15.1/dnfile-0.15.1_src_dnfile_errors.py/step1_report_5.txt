{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for format errors related to 'dn' and resource formats.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions with inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, 'dnFormatError' and 'rsrcFormatError', with the latter inheriting from the former. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger codebase.",
