  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions:\n  ```python\n  class dnFormatError(Exception):\n      pass\n\n  class rsrcFormatError(dnFormatError):\n      pass\n  ```\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or logic beyond class inheritance.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no malicious code, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, and the code is just class definitions, this is justified.\n- No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- No malicious behavior or code is present.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports assume the code is benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code's purpose is clear.\n\n**Step 7: Check score consistency**\n\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware and security risk, confidence at 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- Given the simplicity of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is benign, standard Python exception class definitions, with no security concerns.",
