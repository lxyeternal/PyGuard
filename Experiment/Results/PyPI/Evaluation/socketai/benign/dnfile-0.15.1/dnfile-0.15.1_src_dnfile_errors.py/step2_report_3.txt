  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of two class definitions:\n  ```python\n  class dnFormatError(Exception):\n      pass\n\n  class rsrcFormatError(dnFormatError):\n      pass\n  ```\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n- No external interactions, data flows, or processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is very simple, standard Python exception class definitions, with no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review the logic, reasoning, and summaries**\n\n- All reports agree that these are straightforward class definitions.\n- They consistently note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n- The analyses are aligned and correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores assigned**\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk or malware scores**\n\n- No issues warrant a risk or malware score above 0.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n**Step 5: Cross-check for potential issues or assumptions**\n\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The purpose is purely error handling, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and reports.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive reviews and the code's simplicity, I concur with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**This code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
