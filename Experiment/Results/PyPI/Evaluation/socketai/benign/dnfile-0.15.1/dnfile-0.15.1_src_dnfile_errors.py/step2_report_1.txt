  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward class inheritance defining custom exceptions. The code does not read input, process data, or perform any logic beyond class definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard Python exception class definitions, with no suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned.**  \n- Confidence: all reports assign 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- Obfuscated: all 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.  \n- Malware: all 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent or behavior.  \n- Security risk: all 0, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\nThe scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nSince the code is purely class definitions with no data flow, no external interactions, and no malicious constructs, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Step 5: Examine malware scores.**  \nAll reports correctly assign malware score 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \nThere are no assumptions in these reports that could be challenged; the code is simple, with no logic that could be exploited.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough and consistent reports, I concur with their conclusions. The code is benign, serving as simple exception class definitions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
