  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for DNS and resource format errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, 'dnFormatError' and its subclass 'rsrcFormatError'. There are no data input/output, no logic, and no external interactions. The class definitions are straightforward inheritance from 'Exception'. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It is standard Python code for error handling with no signs of malware or security issues.",
