  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling format errors related to DNS and resource formatting.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class definitions do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines exception classes without any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink paths exist in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code constructs; simple class inheritance without any unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class and each other. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be part of a larger project for error handling, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
