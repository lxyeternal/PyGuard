  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to DNS and resource formatting errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, dnFormatError and rsrcFormatError, with the latter inheriting from the former. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or complex logic. The code is simple class inheritance for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling purposes. There are no malicious elements, suspicious behavior, or security issues present. The code is benign and standard for Python exception class definitions.",
