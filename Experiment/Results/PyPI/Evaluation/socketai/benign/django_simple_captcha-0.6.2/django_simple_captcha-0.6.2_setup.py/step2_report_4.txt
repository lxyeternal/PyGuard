  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity or suspicious code detected; standard setup script.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. The only point to note is the use of `get_captcha_version()`; since its implementation isn't shown, we can't fully verify its safety. However, given the context, it's likely a benign function.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nNo changes needed. The malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup with no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears benign. The analysis correctly notes that `get_captcha_version()`'s implementation isn't visible, but there's no evidence to suspect maliciousness.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, with a slightly higher security risk score due to uncertainty about `get_captcha_version()`.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report sensibly assigns a small security risk (0.2) because the behavior of `get_captcha_version()` isn't shown. The malware score remains 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Justification for risk score:**  \nSince the only external function is `get_captcha_version()`, which could theoretically be malicious, a small risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard setup with minor uncertainty.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning applies. The external `get_version()` function's behavior isn't visible, so a small risk score is appropriate. Malware remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is the external function `get_captcha_version()` or `get_version()`, which could, in theory, contain malicious code. However, without evidence, assigning a low risk score (0.2) is reasonable.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across all reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (appropriate given the uncertainty about external version functions)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, given the information available.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The small risk score reflects uncertainty about external functions but is justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
