  "sinks": "Assignment to FORM_RENDERER (not a sink for untrusted data but a configuration override)",
  "flows": "Import from testproject.settings → override FORM_RENDERER",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can be risky if the source module is compromised; no malicious code or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all settings from a module and overrides a configuration variable. No malicious activity, dynamic code, or external communication is detected. The use of 'import *' is common in Django settings but can pose maintainability or security risks if the imported module is compromised. The override of FORM_RENDERER is explicit and harmless. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context, reflecting the potential risks of wildcard imports but not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard Django settings pattern with a minor security consideration due to 'import *'. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the potential for maintainability issues but not active threats.",
