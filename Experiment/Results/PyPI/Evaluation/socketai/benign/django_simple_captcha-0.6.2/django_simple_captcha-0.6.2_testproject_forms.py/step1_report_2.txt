  "purpose": "Define custom CAPTCHA form fields and templates for form validation in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from django and captcha modules, and class definitions that create form fields and custom widget classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input; form validation occurs when the form is submitted but does not directly lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "User input is captured through the CAPTCHA field in the forms; this data is validated upon form submission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The custom widget only alters the template used for rendering CAPTCHA.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two form classes with CAPTCHA fields, one using the default widget and the other using a custom widget with a specified template. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard for implementing CAPTCHA in Django, with a simple customization of the rendering template. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of CAPTCHA forms with a custom rendering template. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for form validation purposes.",
