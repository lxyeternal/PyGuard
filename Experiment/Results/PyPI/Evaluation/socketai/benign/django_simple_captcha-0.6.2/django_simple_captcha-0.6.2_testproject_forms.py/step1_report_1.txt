{
  "purpose": "Define custom CAPTCHA form fields and forms for user verification in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Imports from django and captcha.fields modules; instantiation of CaptchaField; custom widget class definition.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines form classes and widgets, no data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to form rendering and validation within the Django framework; no external or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The custom widget merely specifies a template; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom form classes for CAPTCHA integration in Django, with a custom widget for CAPTCHA display. It imports necessary classes, extends a widget for customized template rendering, and creates forms for CAPTCHA validation. No external data reading, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior, and no signs of malware or malicious intent. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for implementing CAPTCHA in Django, with no anomalies or security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of CAPTCHA forms with a custom widget. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code is benign and intended for user verification purposes within a Django app.",
