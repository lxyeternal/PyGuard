  "purpose": "Define custom Django forms with CAPTCHA fields for verification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django forms, CaptchaField, and custom widget; instantiation of form classes with CAPTCHA fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink, external data output, or network transmission present in the code.",
  "flows": "User input in CAPTCHA fields validated within Django forms; no data flows to external systems or insecurely stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The custom widget specifies a template, but no malicious behavior is indicated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two form classes using Django's forms framework with CAPTCHA validation. It extends a custom widget without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious network activity is evident. The only notable element is the use of a custom CAPTCHA widget with a specified template, which is standard practice for customizing form appearance. Overall, the code appears benign and aligns with typical Django form customization for CAPTCHA implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django forms with CAPTCHA, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and does not contain any malware or obfuscation.",
