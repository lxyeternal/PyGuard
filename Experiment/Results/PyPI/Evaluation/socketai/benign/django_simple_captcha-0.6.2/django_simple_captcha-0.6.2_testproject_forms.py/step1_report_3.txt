  "flows": "The CAPTCHA input data flows from form submission to CAPTCHA validation mechanisms, but this code only sets up the forms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the customization of CAPTCHA widget is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a custom widget with a specified template, and creates two form classes with CAPTCHA fields. No external data sources or untrusted data flows are present. The code appears to be standard customization of CAPTCHA functionality without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward customization of CAPTCHA forms in Django with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and serves its purpose of customizing CAPTCHA appearance.",
