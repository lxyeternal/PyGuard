  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports Django forms and captcha fields.\n- Defines a custom widget class `CustomCaptchaTextInput` that specifies a custom template.\n- Defines two form classes:\n  - `CaptchaForm` with a default `CaptchaField`.\n  - `CustomCaptchaForm` with a `CaptchaField` using the custom widget.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for Django CAPTCHA integration.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n   - The custom widget only specifies a template, which is common practice for customizing CAPTCHA appearance.\n   - No external data handling, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and lacks malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5.\n   - The code is benign, so risk scores should remain low.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The reports correctly assign malware score 0.\n   - No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code structure.\n   - They recognize that customizing the CAPTCHA template does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign code, no security risks)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of CAPTCHA forms with a custom template.\n- No anomalies, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The custom widget merely alters presentation, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
