  "purpose": "Define Django form classes with CAPTCHA fields for form validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django forms and CAPTCHA fields; instantiation of CAPTCHA fields within form classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "User input captured via CAPTCHA fields, but no processing or transmission occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; custom widget only modifies template_name without introducing code execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django form components and CAPTCHA fields, then defines a custom widget class that specifies a custom template. Two form classes are created with CAPTCHA fields, one using the default widget and one using the custom widget. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation. The custom widget only alters presentation, not behavior, and no malicious code is apparent. No sources or sinks suggest malicious activity. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard CAPTCHA form implementations with a custom template for display. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment.",
