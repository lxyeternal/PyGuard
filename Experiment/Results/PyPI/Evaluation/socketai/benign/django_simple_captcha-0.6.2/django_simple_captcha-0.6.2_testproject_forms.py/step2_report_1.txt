  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two Django form classes (`CaptchaForm` and `CustomCaptchaForm`) that include CAPTCHA fields.\n   - It also defines a custom widget class (`CustomCaptchaTextInput`) that specifies a custom template for rendering the CAPTCHA.\n   - The code uses standard Django and captcha library imports.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling is present.\n   - The custom widget only specifies a template name, which is a common practice for customizing appearance.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - The custom widget's purpose is purely presentation, not behavior-altering.\n   - The overall implementation is straightforward and aligns with standard Django CAPTCHA customization.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk. This is justified since the code is a benign customization of CAPTCHA forms.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard and benign.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here; the code is straightforward.\n   - The only point to consider is whether the custom template specified could be malicious, but this cannot be determined from the code snippet alone. However, since the template is just a filename, and no malicious behavior is evident, the risk remains negligible.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a typical implementation of CAPTCHA forms with a custom display template.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns are detected.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues detected.\n\n**Summary**:\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that the implementation is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
