  "purpose": "Defines Django form classes for CAPTCHA with a custom widget for template rendering.",
  "sources": "Imports from django and captcha.fields; class definitions creating CAPTCHA form fields and a custom widget.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points; only form and widget definitions.",
  "flows": "Form fields and widget are used during form rendering and validation; no external data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django CAPTCHA forms with a custom widget specifying a template. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. The custom widget only alters presentation, not behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of CAPTCHA forms with a custom template. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
