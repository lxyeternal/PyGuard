  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward: importing settings and appending an app to INSTALLED_APPS.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The use of 'import *' is risky but common in Django settings. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?** Not applicable; score is low.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly zero; no malicious activity.\n- **Assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions; the report correctly states the code is benign.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher confidence (0.9).\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2 appropriate.\n- **Summary:** Standard Django pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Score adjustments?** No, the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Issues?** No.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign configuration code.\n- **Scores?** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, only use of 'import *' which is common but risky.\n- **Scores?** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar assessment, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Django configuration snippet.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n- The use of 'import *' is noted as risky but common in Django settings files, not malicious.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are correctly zero across all reports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code does not warrant a higher malware or risk score.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor risk due to 'import *', but standard practice)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard Django configuration, with no security concerns or malicious activity.",
