  "flows": "Importing all settings, then modifying INSTALLED_APPS list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all settings from 'testproject.settings', which is common in Django projects but can be risky due to namespace pollution. It then appends 'rest_framework' to the INSTALLED_APPS list. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The use of 'import *' is a known best-practice violation but not malicious here. The code is straightforward and standard for Django configuration. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minor concern about 'import *'. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django configuration snippet with no signs of malicious activity. The use of 'import *' is a known risky pattern but common in settings files; it does not constitute a security threat in this context. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
