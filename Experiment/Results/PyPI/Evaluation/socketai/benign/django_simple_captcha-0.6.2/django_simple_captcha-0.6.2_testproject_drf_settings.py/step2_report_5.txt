  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code performs a standard Django settings import and appends 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payloads, external data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The use of `from ... import *` is flagged as a potential concern, but it is common in Django settings files and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly acknowledge that the code is benign and typical for Django projects.\n   - They highlight the use of `import *` as a potential risk but correctly note that in this context, it is standard practice.\n   - No significant logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting a minor concern mainly about the use of `import *`.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the context.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is straightforward configuration, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign configuration.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- The code is a typical Django configuration snippet.\n- The use of `import *` is not ideal but is common in settings files and does not indicate malicious activity.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score can stay around 0.2 due to the `import *` pattern, but no higher.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n- The risk score should stay around **0.2**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and the scores are appropriate.",
