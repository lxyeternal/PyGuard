  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing all settings from 'testproject.settings' and appending 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of 'import *', which is common in Django settings but can be risky.\n- None of the reports identify any malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), which is reasonable given the potential issues with 'import *' but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code as presented is syntactically correct and performs standard Django configuration tasks.\n- **Malicious code:** No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The use of 'import *' is a potential security concern but not inherently malicious. It can lead to namespace pollution or accidental override of variables, but in this context, it’s typical.\n\n### Flaws or logical errors:\n- The reports correctly identify the 'import *' as a risk but conclude that the code is benign.\n- No reports suggest any external data flow or untrusted input, which is accurate.\n\n### Scores:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are 0.2, reflecting the potential danger of 'import *' but acknowledging the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8–0.9), which is justified given the consistent assessment across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor concern due to 'import *', but overall benign.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a typical Django configuration snippet, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of 'import *' is a common but risky pattern in settings files, but it does not constitute a security threat here.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code with a minor caution regarding best practices.",
