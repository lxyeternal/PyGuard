  "flows": "User submits form -> form validation -> redirect if valid -> re-render form if invalid",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external calls; import of custom form without implementation details",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django view that processes a CAPTCHA form. It imports a custom form, validates user input, and redirects upon success. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The form's implementation is unknown, but based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The logic is standard, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, follows standard Django practices, and shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero. The reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
