  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports a custom CAPTCHA form (`CaptchaForm`).\n- Handles POST requests: instantiates the form with user data, validates it, and redirects to the same URL with `?ok` if valid.\n- Handles GET requests: renders a template with the form.\n- Uses standard Django practices, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Handle CAPTCHA validation and redirect.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard redirect, no malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, and the report correctly notes no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Render webpage with CAPTCHA, handle submission.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious external calls, no obfuscation, standard redirect.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The logic is typical, and no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Handle form submission, redirect on success.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no external calls, standard Django form handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe and conventional.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Render homepage with CAPTCHA, redirect on validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious domain or data leaks; import of custom form is not suspicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Render CAPTCHA form, redirect on validation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior; potential concern if `CaptchaForm` is malicious, but no evidence here.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign; the only concern would be the nature of `CaptchaForm`, which is not indicated as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Scoring Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are `0`, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** The scores are very low (`0.1` or `0.2`), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n- The reports correctly identify that the only potential concern could be the custom CAPTCHA form, but without evidence of malicious behavior, the scores remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Final System-Wide Assessment**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to the presence of a custom form, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code snippet is benign, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
