  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Code Functionality Overview:**\n- The code imports a custom CAPTCHA form (`CaptchaForm`).\n- It handles form submissions via POST.\n- If the form is valid, it redirects to the same URL with a query parameter `?ok`.\n- Otherwise, it renders the form again.\n- The logic is straightforward, typical for CAPTCHA validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code appears correct and does not contain errors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or malicious code are evident.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign.  \n- They note the use of a custom CAPTCHA form but do not find any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** Since the implementation of `CaptchaForm` is not provided, potential concerns could arise if that form contains malicious logic. However, based solely on this snippet, no issues are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed based on the provided info.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- The highest reported security risk is 0.2, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n- No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Suspicious Behavior:\n- All reports correctly identify no malware.\n- The custom CAPTCHA form could be a concern if malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all analyses are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero or very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\nGiven the thorough reviews and the code snippet:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential issues with the custom form, but no evidence here)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the implementation of `CaptchaForm` itself to ensure it does not contain malicious logic, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
