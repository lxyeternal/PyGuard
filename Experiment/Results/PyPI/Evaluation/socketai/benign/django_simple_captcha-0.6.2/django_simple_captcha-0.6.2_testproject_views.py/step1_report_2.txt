  "purpose": "Render a webpage with a CAPTCHA form and handle form submission.",
  "sources": "request.POST (user input from form submission), form data from CaptchaForm.",
  "sinks": "HttpResponseRedirect (redirects based on form validation).",
  "flows": "User submits form -> request.POST -> CaptchaForm(request.POST) -> if valid -> redirect to same page with '?ok'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, no unusual code constructs or obfuscated code; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code handles a form submission for CAPTCHA validation. It checks if the request is POST, validates the form, and redirects if successful. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It uses a custom CAPTCHA form, which could be scrutinized separately, but within this snippet, no malicious intent is evident. The redirect appends '?ok' to the URL, which is standard practice for indicating success. There are no unsafe code injections, environment variable misuse, or suspicious network activity. Overall, the code appears to be a typical Django view for CAPTCHA validation without malicious or maliciously designed features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view handling CAPTCHA form submission with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
