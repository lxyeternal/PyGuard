  "purpose": "Render a homepage with a CAPTCHA form and redirect upon successful validation.",
  "sources": "Request POST data when form is submitted, form validation via CaptchaForm.",
  "sinks": "HttpResponseRedirect using request.path + \"?ok\".",
  "flows": "User submits form (source) -> form validation -> redirect (sink) if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain or data leaks, no obfuscated code. CustomCaptchaForm is imported, but its implementation is unknown; however, just importing it is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code handles form rendering and submission. On POST, it instantiates CaptchaForm with user data and redirects if valid. The redirect URL is the same path with a query parameter, which is benign. No use of environment variables, no code injection, and no suspicious network activity are present. The import of a custom CAPTCHA form does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the logic appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard form handling with CAPTCHA verification and redirection. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
