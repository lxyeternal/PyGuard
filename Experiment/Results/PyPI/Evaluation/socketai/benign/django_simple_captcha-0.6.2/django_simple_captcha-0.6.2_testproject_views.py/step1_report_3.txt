  "purpose": "Handle form submission and validation for a CAPTCHA form on the home page.",
  "sources": "Reads POST data from the HTTP request when a form is submitted.",
  "targets": "Performs a redirect based on form validation; no other untrusted data used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Request.POST -> CaptchaForm(request.POST) -> form.is_valid() -> HttpResponseRedirect (if valid).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a form with POST data when available, validates it, and redirects upon success. The form class is imported from a module named 'forms', which is common for Django projects. The redirect appends a simple query parameter. No use of environment variables, external network calls, or other risky behaviors is observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for form handling in Django.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic form handling with validation and redirection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet.",
