  "flows": "Request POST data -> form validation -> successful validation -> redirect to request.path + '?ok'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain usage, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom CAPTCHA form, processes form submissions via POST requests, validates the form, and redirects to the same URL with a query parameter upon success. The redirect URL is constructed using request.path, which is a standard and safe practice. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The logic appears straightforward and typical for CAPTCHA validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard form validation and redirect operations with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
