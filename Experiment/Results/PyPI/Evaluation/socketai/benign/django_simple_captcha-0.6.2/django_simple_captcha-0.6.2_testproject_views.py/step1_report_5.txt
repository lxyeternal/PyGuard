  "purpose": "Render a webpage with a CAPTCHA form that redirects upon successful form validation.",
  "sources": "Request.POST data when the form is submitted; instantiation of CaptchaForm with request.POST data.",
  "sinks": "HttpResponseRedirect that redirects to the same URL with a query parameter upon form validation.",
  "flows": "User submits form -> form data received from request.POST -> form validated -> redirect to same URL with '?ok' if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The CaptchaForm is a custom form but its implementation is not provided; potential concern if maliciously designed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django view: it processes form submissions, validates the form, and redirects accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The custom form could be a concern if malicious, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious intent is evident. The redirection is standard behavior after form validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django view handling a CAPTCHA form with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the nature of the custom CaptchaForm, but no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
