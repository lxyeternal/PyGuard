{
  "purpose": "This script is a Django management utility launcher that attempts to execute Django commands based on the environment and Django version.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE), imports modules (django.core.management), and reads the local settings.py file.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' to configure Django settings, executes management commands via execute_manager or execute_from_command_line.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> Checks Django version -> Sets environment variable -> Executes management commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; uses standard Django management functions; setting 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' explicitly is typical but could be misused if manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages the execution of Django commands, handling different Django versions. It sets an environment variable for Django settings and imports local settings.py. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or external data sources are involved. The logic is straightforward, and all actions are consistent with a typical Django management script. No anomalies or malicious code behaviors are present, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The script's structure appears standard and intended solely for Django project management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It handles environment setup and command execution in a conventional manner. The risk of malware or security threats from this code is very low.",
