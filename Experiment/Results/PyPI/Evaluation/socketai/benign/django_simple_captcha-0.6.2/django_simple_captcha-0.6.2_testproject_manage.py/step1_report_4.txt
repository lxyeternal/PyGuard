{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and runs Django management commands, handling different Django versions and importing settings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', importing modules 'os', 'sys', and 'django.core.management', and importing 'settings' locally.",
  "sinks": "Setting environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', calling 'execute_manager' or 'execute_from_command_line', writing error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> conditional check for Django version -> import settings or handle ImportError -> set environment variable -> run Django management command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Usage of deprecated 'execute_manager' (older Django version), but not malicious. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code determines Django version by attempting to import 'execute_manager'. If present, it sets 'OLD_DJANGO' to True, then attempts to import 'settings'. If not, it uses 'execute_from_command_line'. It adjusts 'sys.path' for project directory, sets environment variable for Django settings, and runs management commands accordingly. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior are evident. The script appears to be standard setup code for a Django project with version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard Django project setup code with version handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious actions. It is a typical script for running Django commands, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
