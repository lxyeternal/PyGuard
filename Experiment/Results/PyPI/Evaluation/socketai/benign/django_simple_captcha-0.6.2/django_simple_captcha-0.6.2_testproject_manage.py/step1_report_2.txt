{
  "purpose": "To set up and run a Django management script, handling both old and new Django versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system for 'settings.py' and imports it, reads environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', and processes command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Import statements, environment variable assignment, and execution functions that trigger Django management commands.",
  "flows": "Imports 'settings.py' -> sets 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' environment variable -> executes management commands via Django's functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Usage of deprecated 'execute_manager' suggests legacy code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages importing Django management functions based on Django version, loads 'settings.py', and executes commands. It conditionally imports modules and sets environment variables, which are typical for Django scripts. No untrusted data sources or malicious code patterns are evident. The script handles legacy and current Django setups without suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Django management wrapper with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It functions as intended for project management, with no security risks detected.",
