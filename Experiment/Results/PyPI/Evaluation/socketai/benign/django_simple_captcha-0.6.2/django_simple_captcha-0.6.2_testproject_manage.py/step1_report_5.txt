  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs a Django management command, configuring environment variables and importing necessary modules.",
  "sources": [
    "import os",
    "import sys",
    "from django.core.management import execute_manager or execute_from_command_line",
    "import settings (if OLD_DJANGO is True)"

  "sinks": [
    "os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE']",
    "execute_manager(settings)",
    "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Imports from Django and standard libraries -> Sets BASEDIR -> Sets environment variable -> Calls appropriate execution method based on Django version"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Usage of deprecated Django execution method (execute_manager) which could indicate outdated or misconfigured code.",
    "Importing 'settings' directly rather than through environment variables could pose risks if settings contain sensitive data or are improperly configured.",
    "No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code present."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Django application startup, handling different Django versions by conditionally importing and executing management commands. It sets a specific environment variable pointing to a settings module. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. The script does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated logic. The use of deprecated functions suggests the code may be outdated, but it does not introduce security risks per se.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard Django management script with no evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly manages environment setup and execution based on Django version, without hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
