  "purpose": "This script is a management utility for Django projects, handling different Django versions and setting up environment configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), imports modules (django.core.management, settings), and accesses __file__.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables, calls Django management functions, potentially executes commands via sys.argv.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> Checks Django version -> Loads settings -> Sets environment variable -> Executes Django management command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of environment variables and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup for a Django project, with conditional imports based on Django version. It manipulates sys.path and environment variables appropriately. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are observed. It relies on external modules (django), which are standard for Django projects. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond standard Django management commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django project management script with no indications of malicious behavior. It securely manages environment settings and module imports without malicious anomalies.",
