  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including database setup, installed apps, templates, middleware, and CAPTCHA settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH' and 'CAPTCHA_SOX_PATH' used to set paths for CAPTCHA components.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influence paths; no other untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH and CAPTCHA_SOX_PATH; no other data flows or user input handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for CAPTCHA component paths; SECRET_KEY set to 'empty' which is insecure for production; DEBUG mode is enabled, which is unsafe in production; no hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no suspicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Django configuration settings, which appear standard. Environment variables are used for setting CAPTCHA component paths, which is typical for configurable components. The SECRET_KEY is set to a placeholder string 'empty', which is insecure if used in production but not inherently malicious. DEBUG mode is enabled, which is unsafe for production but common during development. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells are present. The overall structure is typical for a Django project with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior. Some insecure settings (SECRET_KEY and DEBUG) are present, but these are typical in development environments rather than indicators of malicious intent.",
