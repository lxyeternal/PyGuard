  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django project, including database, templates, middleware, and CAPTCHA settings.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for CAPTCHA paths, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, and static data such as project paths and language settings.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for CAPTCHA paths; potential exposure of sensitive data if environment variables are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH, CAPTCHA_SOX_PATH; Static data (e.g., SECRET_KEY, project paths) used within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'empty', which is insecure; environment variables are used for CAPTCHA paths, but their handling appears standard; no other unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Django configuration settings with no complex logic or dynamic code execution. The SECRET_KEY is insecurely set as 'empty', which could lead to security issues if used in production. Environment variables for CAPTCHA paths are used appropriately, though their security depends on external configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, the code is a standard configuration with a notable security concern regarding SECRET_KEY.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django configuration code with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the insecure hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which could be exploited if used in production. No malware, malicious data flows, or obfuscated code detected.",
