  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the SECRET_KEY as set to \"empty,\" which is insecure but not malicious.\n- Environment variables are used for CAPTCHA paths, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware are present.\n- The code is a typical Django configuration with no complex logic or suspicious data flows.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard Django config, no issues.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes insecure SECRET_KEY, no malware.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (due to insecure SECRET_KEY).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, only insecure SECRET_KEY.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, only insecure SECRET_KEY.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar configuration.\n- **Analysis:** Notes insecure SECRET_KEY, DEBUG mode enabled (which is unsafe but not malicious).\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Purpose:** Same general setup.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusions.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.2 or 0.3), mainly due to insecure SECRET_KEY and development settings (DEBUG mode). These are configuration issues but not malicious.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0.3 to reflect the insecure SECRET_KEY more prominently, as it could compromise security if used in production.\n- Malware and obfuscation scores are accurate at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (due to insecure SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode in some reports)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard Django configuration with no malicious intent. The primary concern is insecure secret management, which is a security best practice issue rather than malware. The environment variable usage is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always recommend replacing the SECRET_KEY with a secure, randomly generated value before deploying to production.",
