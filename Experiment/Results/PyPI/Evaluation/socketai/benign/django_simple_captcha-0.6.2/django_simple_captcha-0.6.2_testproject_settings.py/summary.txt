  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django configuration with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the insecure SECRET_KEY, which should be replaced with a secure, randomly generated secret before deployment. No evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
