  "purpose": "Configuration settings for Django, including database, templates, CAPTCHA, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for CAPTCHA paths; hardcoded SECRET_KEY; standard Django settings and imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; configuration data flows from environment variables and code constants to application settings.",
  "anomalies": "Insecure SECRET_KEY set to 'empty'; DEBUG mode enabled; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django settings module with standard configuration. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The only security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is insecure for production but not malicious. Environment variables are used appropriately for CAPTCHA paths. No network activity or malicious behavior is detected. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django configuration with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the insecure SECRET_KEY, which should be replaced with a secure, randomly generated secret before deployment. No evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
