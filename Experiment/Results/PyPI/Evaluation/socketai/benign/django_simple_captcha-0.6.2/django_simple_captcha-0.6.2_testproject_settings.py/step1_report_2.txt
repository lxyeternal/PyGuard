  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project with captcha integration, database, and template settings.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get for CAPTCHA_PATH variables, hardcoded SECRET_KEY",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence captcha paths; SECRET_KEY is static.",
  "anomalies": "SECRET_KEY set to 'empty' which is insecure and indicates a development setup; use of environment variables for paths is standard, but potential risk if paths are maliciously set.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration data for a Django project. It uses environment variables for CAPTCHA paths, which is common. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as 'empty', which is insecure in production but not malicious by itself. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. No data leakage, code injection, or malware signals are detected. The overall structure and usage do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. It is a straightforward Django settings module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django settings configuration with no signs of malicious behavior. The main concern is the insecure SECRET_KEY, which is typical in development but should be changed in production. No malware or malicious activities are indicated.",
