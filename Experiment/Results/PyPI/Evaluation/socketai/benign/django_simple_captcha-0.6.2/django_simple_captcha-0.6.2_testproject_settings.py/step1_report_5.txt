  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project, including database, templates, middleware, and CAPTCHA settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable access for CAPTCHA paths; default SECRET_KEY assignment.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable retrieval via os.environ.get() for CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH and CAPTCHA_SOX_PATH.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to configuration variables; no direct data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is set to a hardcoded value 'empty', which is insecure for production. Use of environment variables for CAPTCHA paths is standard but should be validated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module with configurations for databases, templates, middleware, and third-party apps like captcha. The SECRET_KEY being set to 'empty' is a security concern as it can compromise Django's security mechanisms if used in production. The environment variables for CAPTCHA paths are standard practice; however, no validation is implemented for their values. No malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The code does not include any network communication, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django configuration file with a critical security flaw in the hardcoded SECRET_KEY. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. The main risk is related to insecure secret management, not malicious intent.",
