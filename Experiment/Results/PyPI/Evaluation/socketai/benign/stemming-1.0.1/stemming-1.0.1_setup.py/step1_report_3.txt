  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging the 'stemming' Python library.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line, external URLs for project info and bug reports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging, importing setuptools, defining package metadata, and calling setup(). No code execution beyond package configuration. No input parsing, network connections, or runtime data handling. It includes links to project URLs and contact info, but these are typical for open-source packages and not suspicious. No signs of malicious code or behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical configuration file with no indicators of malware.",
