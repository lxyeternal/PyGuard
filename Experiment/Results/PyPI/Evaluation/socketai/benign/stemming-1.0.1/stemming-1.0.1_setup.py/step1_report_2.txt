  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up and install a Python package named 'stemming' with multiple stemming algorithms included.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author info, description, and URLs from hardcoded strings and variables.",
  "sinks": "The script does not include any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform operations like network communication, file modification, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs; the setup process solely uses predefined metadata and package configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It contains only static data and standard setup parameters. There are no input sources, no processing of external or untrusted data, and no suspicious or malicious code. The URLs and author information are publicly available and do not indicate any malicious intent. The script does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or system modifications. Overall, it appears to be a benign and typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is safe to use.",
