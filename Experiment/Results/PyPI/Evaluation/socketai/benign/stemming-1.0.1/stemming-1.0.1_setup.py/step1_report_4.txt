{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'stemming' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static string literals within the setup() function, imports from standard library modules (os.path, sys), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or user input processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses them solely for package configuration purposes. It defines package metadata, such as name, version, author info, description, classifiers, and URLs, with no dynamic or user-input-driven logic. No external data, network connections, or code execution is present. The code aligns with typical setup.py files for Python packages and contains no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It only contains package metadata and build instructions.",
