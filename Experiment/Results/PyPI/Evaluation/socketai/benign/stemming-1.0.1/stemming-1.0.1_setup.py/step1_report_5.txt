{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'stemming' Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package information from the setup() function parameters, such as name, version, author, description, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present; code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded metadata in setup() to package distribution tools; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os.path, sys, setuptools) and calls setup() with static package metadata. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data or credentials. The URLs and email addresses are publicly known and benign. The script performs a typical package configuration without any signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
