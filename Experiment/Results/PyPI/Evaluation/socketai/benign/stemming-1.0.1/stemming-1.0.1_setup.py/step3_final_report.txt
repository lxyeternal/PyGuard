{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called 'stemming'. It defines package metadata and configuration without executing any runtime logic or processing external data.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, author info, URLs, and import statements for setuptools and standard modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the script only calls setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or runtime data processing occurs; the script is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports only necessary modules and defines static package metadata. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. URLs point to legitimate repositories. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All indicators confirm its safety and legitimacy.",
