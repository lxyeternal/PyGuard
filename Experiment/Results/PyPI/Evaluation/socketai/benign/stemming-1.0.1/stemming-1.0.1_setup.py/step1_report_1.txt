  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'stemming' Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data such as package name, version, author info, description, long description, classifiers, and URLs. No input or dynamic data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present. The code does not handle external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard setup tools and defines package metadata for distribution. All data is hardcoded and static, with no input handling or external data processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The URLs point to legitimate repositories and issue trackers, and there are no code execution, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
