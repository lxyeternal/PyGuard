{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations, likely for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, or external files (if any present). No explicit input sources detected in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs such as network connections, file writes, or system commands (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to outputs or processing functions is not explicitly complex or suspicious based on the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are observed. No obfuscated code features or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain network connections, data exfiltration mechanisms, or backdoors. The structure and usage are consistent with benign scripts. Without further context or hidden code, it appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code seems benign and suitable for its intended purpose.",
