  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm in Python for reducing words to their root forms.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; operates on provided string arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string processed through regex matching and string manipulations within the stem() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed. The code uses regex patterns for pattern matching but nothing suspicious is evident. No hardcoded credentials or environment variables. No dynamic code execution or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements the Porter stemming algorithm with regex pattern matching and string operations. It processes input words to remove suffixes based on linguistic rules, using precompiled regex patterns for efficiency. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code segments were detected. It is a standard algorithm implementation with clear, well-structured regex-based processing steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm intended for linguistic processing. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
