  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm to reduce words to their root forms in English.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words provided to the 'stem' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network; the code processes input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input word -> stem function -> internal regex matching and string manipulation -> output stemmed word.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard linguistic processing with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regex operations and defines multiple regex patterns for the stemming rules. It includes dictionaries for suffix replacements (_step2list, _step3list) and several regex patterns for linguistic conditions (_mgr0, _meq1, etc.). The 'stem' function applies multiple steps to modify the input word based on suffix patterns and linguistic rules, following the Porter stemming algorithm. The logic is consistent with a natural language processing task. There are no external system calls, network activities, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is a straightforward implementation of a known algorithm with standard regex patterns, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm for natural language processing. It reads input words, applies linguistic rules via regex matching and string manipulation, and outputs the stemmed word. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
