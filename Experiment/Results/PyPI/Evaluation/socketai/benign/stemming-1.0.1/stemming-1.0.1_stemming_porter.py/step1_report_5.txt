  "purpose": "Implementing the Porter stemming algorithm for English words to reduce words to their root form.",
  "sources": "Input words provided to the 'stem' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'stem' function processes input words and returns stemmed words; no external data or untrusted sources are accessed.",
  "flows": "Input word -> stem function -> processing steps (including regex matches and string modifications) -> output stemmed word.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard stemming operations with no external network calls or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm. It uses regex patterns to identify suffixes and apply rules to strip them. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks are present. The regex patterns and suffix lists are hardcoded, consistent with typical implementations. The code does not contain obfuscated language features, nor does it include any suspicious behaviors such as system commands, file manipulations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern would be if this code was used in a malicious context, but on its own, it is a benign algorithm implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This package implements a standard Porter stemming algorithm with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, non-malicious implementation focused solely on text processing.",
