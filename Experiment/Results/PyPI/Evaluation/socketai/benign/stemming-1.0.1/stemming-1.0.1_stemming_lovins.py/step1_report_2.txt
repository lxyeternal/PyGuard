{
  "purpose": "Implement Lovins stemming algorithm for reducing words to their base forms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (words passed to 'stem', 'remove_ending', 'fix_ending') and accesses internal data structures for endings and rules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that could lead to data leaks or system effects. The code does not perform network communication, execute system commands, or access sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input word -> remove_ending -> fix_ending -> return stemmed word; no external or untrusted data flows or effects beyond string manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a known stemming algorithm.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm, including functions for applying multiple condition checks and ending modifications. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or system modifications. All data structures and functions serve the purpose of linguistic processing. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The code uses only internal data and well-defined string operations. The lack of external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic code execution further suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs linguistic processing on input words without any harmful side effects.",
