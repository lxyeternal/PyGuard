{
  "purpose": "Implements Lovins stemming algorithm for reducing words to their stems.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'word' in the 'stem' function; data from the 'word' parameter; static rules and conditions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks, external network calls, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' is processed through 'remove_ending' and 'fix_ending' functions, which modify the string based on rule matching.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors observed. The code performs standard linguistic processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a stemming algorithm, using static rules and conditions to strip suffixes from words. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or system modifications are present. The functions operate purely on string data with no external dependencies or hidden behaviors. The rule-based approach is typical for natural language processing and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a linguistic stemming algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The logic is standard, well-structured, and solely focused on string manipulation for word stemming.",
