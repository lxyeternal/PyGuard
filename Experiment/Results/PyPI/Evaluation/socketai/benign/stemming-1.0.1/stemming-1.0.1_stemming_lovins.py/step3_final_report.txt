{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm for linguistic processing, providing a stem() function to reduce words to their root forms.",
  "sources": "Static data structures containing suffix rules and conditions, string slicing operations to identify and remove suffixes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read external input during execution, nor does it write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The remove_ending() function identifies suffixes based on static rules and conditions, then passes the word to fix_ending() which applies further suffix modifications; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, static implementation of a well-known stemming algorithm with no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple condition functions for suffix removal rules, a set of suffix rules stored in dictionaries by length, and functions remove_ending() and fix_ending() to process words. The logic is static, rule-based, and solely string manipulation. No external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's purpose is linguistic stemming, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The data structures and functions are transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the static, self-contained nature of the code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
