  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the static, self-contained nature of the code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency."
