{
  "purpose": "Implements the Lovins stemming algorithm for reducing words to their stems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words via the 'stem' function parameter. It uses internal data structures (dictionaries, lists) for rule matching. No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to external systems, files, or networks. It solely processes input words locally.",
  "flows": "Input word → remove_ending() → fix_ending() → stem() → output stemmed word. No untrusted data flows into external systems or triggers side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard implementation of a well-known algorithm. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The pattern matching rules and conditions are typical for stemming algorithms. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of condition functions for linguistic rules, dictionaries for suffix matching, and functions for removing and fixing endings based on these rules. The logic follows typical stemming procedures. No external inputs, network calls, or file I/O are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code operates purely on provided words, applying pattern rules and returning a stemmed result. Its structure is clear, well-organized, and standard for a linguistic stemming module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of the Lovins stemming algorithm. It contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The security risk is minimal.",
