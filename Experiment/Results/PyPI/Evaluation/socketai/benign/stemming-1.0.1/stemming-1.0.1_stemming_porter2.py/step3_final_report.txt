{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm for English words, used to reduce words to their root forms for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "Input words provided to the stem() function; internal regex pattern matches for linguistic rules.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications; purely string manipulations and pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input word -> pattern matching and regex checks -> suffix removal or transformation -> output stemmed word.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Exception dictionaries and regex patterns are standard for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm. It performs linguistic transformations through regex pattern matching and string operations. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious code are present. The exception handling and pattern matching are typical for stemming algorithms. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. All signals point to a benign, open-source-like implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Porter2 stemmer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis and multiple reviews.",
