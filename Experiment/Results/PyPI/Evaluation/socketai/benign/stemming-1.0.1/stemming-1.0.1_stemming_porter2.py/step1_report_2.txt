{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm for processing English words to their root forms, typically used in natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input words provided to the stem() function; specifically, the parameter 'word' in the main function and the various processing functions that operate on it.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that send data to external systems, perform network operations, or access sensitive data. The code primarily manipulates strings locally without external side effects.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through a series of transformations, including normalization, rule-based suffix stripping, and exceptions, all within the same process flow without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code contains straightforward string processing and pattern matching without any hidden or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard implementation of a well-known stemming algorithm, with functions for handling various suffixes and linguistic rules. It uses regular expressions and simple conditional logic to process words. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are involved. The code is well-structured, readable, and matches typical open-source NLP code for stemming. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is that it performs string manipulations which, if misused, could lead to unexpected results in some applications, but this is normal for a stemmer.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions solely to process text locally without external effects. No security risks are identified.",
