{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm for English words, used to reduce words to their root forms for natural language processing.",
  "sources": "Input word to the stem() function, and environment variables or external inputs are not explicitly used within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string manipulations only; no data is sent over the network, stored externally, or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input word is processed through a series of steps: initial modifications, conditional transformations, and normalization, with internal function calls that manipulate the string based on suffixes and patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies solely on pattern matching and string manipulation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard stemming algorithm with well-known pattern matches and suffix rules. It includes some exceptional case handling and a small set of exceptions. No external inputs, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The only potential concern could be misuse of the stemming function in a malicious context, but as-is, it performs legitimate linguistic processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs string pattern matching and transformations for linguistic processing only.",
