{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm for natural language processing, converting words to their root forms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words passed to the 'stem' function, processes predefined strings and regular expressions internally, and checks against known exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions such as network communication, file operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through multiple transformation steps; no external data or untrusted sources are utilized beyond the initial input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to follow a standard stemming process with no suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. Regular expressions and string manipulations are used solely for linguistic processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a known stemming algorithm with well-defined steps. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated techniques are present. It does not contain malicious code, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions perform linguistic transformations and handle specific word patterns. No anomalous or suspicious patterns were identified. The only potential concern is that it includes hardcoded exception dictionaries, which is standard for this algorithm, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm with no evidence of malicious behavior. It only performs linguistic processing for text normalization. No malware or security risks are present.",
