  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation, and states the code is a standard implementation of Porter2 stemming.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of Porter2. No suspicious behavior, external calls, or malicious patterns are present. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of external data, network activity, or malicious code. Recognizes the code as a standard open-source stemmer.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's content. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms no external data, no malicious code, and standard pattern matching for linguistic purposes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's structure. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—no external dependencies, no malicious code, standard pattern matching, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—no malicious activity, no external data, standard implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Code:\n\n- The code performs linguistic stemming, with no network calls, no file I/O, no dynamic code execution.\n- The only \"suspicious\" elements are exception dictionaries and regex pattern matching, which are standard for such algorithms.\n- No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code's purpose is purely linguistic processing.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques used)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Justification:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
