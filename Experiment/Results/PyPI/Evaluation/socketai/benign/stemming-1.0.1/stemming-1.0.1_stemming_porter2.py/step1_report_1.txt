{
  "purpose": "Implementing the Porter2 stemming algorithm for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input words via function arguments; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data, output is a transformed version of input words.",
  "flows": "Input word -> processing steps (initial modifications, multiple stemming steps) -> output stemmed word.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. The code strictly performs linguistic stemming. No malicious privacy violations or data leaks observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple regex patterns and functions for language-specific stemming rules, handling special cases, and applying sequential transformations. It processes words to reduce them to their stems. There are no external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution. Exception handling is limited to predefined exceptional word forms. The code appears to be a faithful implementation of an established algorithm with no malicious modifications or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions solely to process text input for linguistic purposes.",
