{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm for English words.",
  "sources": "Reads input words passed to the stem() function; checks for exceptions and specific suffixes during stemming.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is sent to network or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through multiple transformation steps with internal functions, with no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated logic. The only notable aspect is the exception handling and pattern matching, which are standard for stemming algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The script performs natural language processing (stemming) without external data dependencies or network activity. It includes several pattern matching functions, suffix removal steps, and exception handling, all consistent with the intended algorithm. No code injects malicious commands, executes external code, or manipulates system resources maliciously. The only potential concern is the use of regular expressions, but they serve legitimate linguistic purposes and do not pose security risks. No signs of data leakage, credential theft, or malicious privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a linguistic algorithm without malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It is a standard implementation of the Porter2 stemmer, with no malicious or suspicious code observed.",
