  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Porter2 stemming with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n- **Justification:** The code performs linguistic processing with no external dependencies or suspicious patterns. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** This aligns well with the code's nature. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard implementation, no external data, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Clear, straightforward string processing; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard linguistic stemming code with no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n- **Justification:** The code only manipulates strings based on linguistic rules.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—benign, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No external or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also a standard, legitimate implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n- **Justification:** The code only performs string pattern matching and transformations.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; the code is a straightforward implementation of a well-known algorithm.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The code's design and the reports' reasoning are consistent. No modifications or increased scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, open-source implementation of the Porter2 stemming algorithm with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
