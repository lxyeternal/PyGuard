{
  "purpose": "Implements the Paice-Husk stemming algorithm for natural language processing, allowing stemming with default or custom rules.",
  "sources": "Reads rule data from a string input in the constructor, processes rules in read_rules(), and processes words in the stem() method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external interactions; the code processes input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input rule string -> read_rules() parsing rules -> stem() processes words based on rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses regex matching and string processing in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard stemming algorithm with regex parsing and string manipulations. It reads rules from a string, processes each line, and applies rules to words for stemming. No external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious code injection, or obfuscated features are present. The logic is typical for such algorithms, and all operations appear benign. No malicious intent or sabotage behaviors are evident. The code relies solely on local processing and standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of the Paice-Husk stemming algorithm without any malicious features or security risks. It operates as intended for text processing and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security concerns.",
