  "purpose": "Implementation of the Paice-Husk stemming algorithm for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "Reads rule data from a string, processes words via regex matching and string manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; processes data locally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input words are matched against regex, rules are applied based on suffixes, and words are stemmed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; static rule data embedded as a string; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, rule-based implementation of a well-known stemming algorithm. It uses regex for parsing rules, applies them to input words, and performs string operations without external dependencies or network activity. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The static rules are data, not executable code, and are used solely for linguistic processing. The logic is clear, deterministic, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, transparent, and implements a standard NLP algorithm without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The static rules do not pose a security risk, and the code's behavior is predictable and safe.",
