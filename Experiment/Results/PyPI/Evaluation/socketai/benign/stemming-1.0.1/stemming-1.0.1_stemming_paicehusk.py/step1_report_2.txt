  "purpose": "Implementation of the Paice-Husk stemming algorithm for natural language processing, providing functions to stem words based on customizable rules.",
  "sources": "Reads rule data from a string parameter in __init__ and the default rule string; processes input words in the stem() method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or system calls, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input rule string -> read_rules() parses rules -> stem() processes words based on rules -> returns stemmed words.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain anomalies or suspicious constructs. Rule parsing and processing appear standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for implementing a known stemming algorithm with rule parsing using regex and string manipulation. It reads rule data from a string, processes rules with regex matching, and applies rules to words for stemming. The default rules are hardcoded as a string, which is typical for this type of algorithm. The methods and logic follow standard NLP stemming practices without any suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no network operations, no code injection points, no hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The structure is clear, and all imported modules are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a stemmer based on the Paice-Husk algorithm, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely performs rule-based word stemming, with no network or system side-effects. The code appears safe and free of malicious intent.",
