{
  "purpose": "Implements the Paice-Husk stemming algorithm for natural language processing, providing functions to stem words based on configurable rules.",
  "sources": "Reads rule definitions from a string input during initialization; reads words for stemming through the stem() method; uses regex patterns to parse rules and words.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly influences system behavior or leaks occur; no network, file, or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input rule string flows into read_rules(), which parses and stores rules; input words flow into stem(), which applies rules to produce stemmed output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and primarily performs rule-based text processing with standard Python libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for rule-based stemming using regex for parsing rules and words. It reads rules from a provided string, storing them in a dictionary. The stem() method processes words iteratively applying rules based on the last character, checking conditions like 'intact' status and vowel positions. The rules are standard for stemming purposes and do not include any network, file, or system-level operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure is clean and adheres to expected natural language processing techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a well-known stemming algorithm with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely processes text based on rules without performing any harmful actions or data leaks.",
