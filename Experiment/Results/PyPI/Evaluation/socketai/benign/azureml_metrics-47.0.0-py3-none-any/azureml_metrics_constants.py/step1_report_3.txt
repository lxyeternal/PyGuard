{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, enumerations, and configuration settings for various machine learning metrics, tasks, objectives, and related parameters used in an automated ML framework.",
  "sources": "Constants, class attributes, and import statements; no user input or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no network, file, or environment variable writing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets static constants and configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or credentials found; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The import of 'pkg_resources' is standard for version retrieval; numpy is used for numeric limits. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining static constants, enums, and mappings for metrics, tasks, and objectives. It imports standard libraries and third-party packages for configuration and version management, with no signs of data manipulation, external communication, or runtime code evaluation. All variables and constants serve configuration purposes aligned with the framework's functional scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, structured as a configuration module for an ML system. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious privacy violations. The presence of hardcoded parameters and static definitions is typical for such a module. Overall, the risk of malicious intent is extremely low.",
