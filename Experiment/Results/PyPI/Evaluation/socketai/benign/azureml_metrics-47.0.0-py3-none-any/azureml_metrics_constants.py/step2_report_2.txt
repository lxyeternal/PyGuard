  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static configuration module defining constants, enums, and mappings for ML metrics and tasks within Azure ML. No external input, data sinks, or dynamic code execution are present. The version retrieval via `pkg_resources.get_distribution` is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high, and no anomalies or security risks are found.\n\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The code is safe, static, and intended for configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a collection of constants and mappings with no external data handling or dynamic behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The absence of external interactions or obfuscated code is correctly noted.\n\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The code appears benign and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants, enums, and configuration settings for ML metrics and tasks. No external data sources or sinks are evident. The import of `pkg_resources` and `numpy` is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. No secrets or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The code is safe and intended for configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive collection of static definitions for metrics, objectives, and tasks, with no evidence of external data handling or malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate. No suspicious patterns or security risks are identified.\n\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is static configuration with no external data processing, network activity, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly concludes that the code is purely declarative and safe.\n\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a static, declarative configuration module. It defines constants, enums, sets, and mappings for ML metrics, tasks, objectives, and system parameters.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The import of `pkg_resources` for version info is standard.\n\n- **Security Risks:** No external input handling, network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution are observed. No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are embedded.\n\n- **Logical Flaws:** The reports are consistent; no logical flaws or suspicious claims are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and consensus across all reports, **the code is a static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks**.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score (0-1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0         | No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior. |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0         | Clear, static definitions; no obfuscation detected.        |\n| Risk               | 0.0         | No security risks identified; purely declarative.          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for configuration within an ML framework.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. This code can be considered secure and non-malicious.",
