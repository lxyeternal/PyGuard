{
  "purpose": "Define constants, enumerations, and mappings related to metrics, tasks, objectives, and configurations for machine learning workflows in AutoML.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, enum, numpy, pkg_resources), class definitions, constant declarations, dictionaries for metric mappings and ranges, task and objective definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; no network, file, or system commands executed directly from the code.",
  "flows": "Data and metric definitions are static; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static definitions including constants, enumerations, sets, and mappings for various machine learning metrics and tasks. It imports standard libraries and third-party packages (numpy, pkg_resources) but does not execute any external commands, read input data, or perform network operations. The constants and mappings appear consistent with standard ML metric configurations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is well-structured and static, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of static definitions used for ML metrics and tasks within an AutoML framework. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious signals are detected. It is safe and intended for configuration purposes.",
