  "purpose": "Define constants, metrics, tasks, and configuration settings for an AutoML and machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "import sys, from enum import Enum, import numpy as np, import pkg_resources, class definitions, constants, and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling, external data reading, or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Constants and metrics are statically defined; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden logic present. All constants and configurations appear to serve legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a comprehensive collection of constants, enumerations, and mappings for metrics, tasks, objectives, and configuration parameters used in an ML framework. It uses standard Python modules and idioms, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, input processing, or external network interactions. The presence of large static data structures and constants is typical for configuration files. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or obfuscated logic are found. The structure is clear and aligns with normal software development patterns for ML systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and constants module for an AutoML framework, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It contains no indications of malware, backdoors, or security risks. All signals suggest it is safe and intended for legitimate use.",
