  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a static collection of constants, enums, and mappings for metrics, tasks, objectives, and configurations used in an Azure ML AutoML framework. No dynamic logic, input handling, or external data processing is present. The code is purely declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n   All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. They correctly identify that the code is a configuration module with standard imports (`sys`, `enum`, `numpy`, `pkg_resources`) and no suspicious logic.\n\n3. **Scores given to issues:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity. They also rate the security risk as zero, which is appropriate given the static, configuration nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or external interactions, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports correctly assign a low or zero risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   No malicious activity, code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The import of `pkg_resources` for version retrieval is standard, and numpy is used only for numeric limits. No signs of malware.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature of the code and the absence of external or dynamic behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a static, well-structured configuration module for an AutoML framework. It contains no malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscated logic, and no external data handling. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is purely declarative, with no dynamic execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns. It is standard for configuration modules in ML frameworks. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are aligned with this assessment. No changes are necessary to the scoring or conclusions.",
