  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines constants, enums, and mappings for metrics/tasks in Azure ML AutoML.\n- Sources: Static definitions, standard imports.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external data or dynamic execution.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard version retrieval via `pkg_resources`.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Purely declarative, static configuration; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration module with no malicious activity. The absence of dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network communication supports this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines constants, metrics, tasks, and configurations for AutoML.\n- Sources: Imports, class attributes, constants.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external data or dynamic logic.\n- Anomalies: None; standard patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Static definitions with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report accurately concludes that the code is a benign configuration module. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines constants, enums, and settings for ML workflows.\n- Sources: Imports, class attributes, constants.\n- Sinks & Flows: Static, no external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None; standard imports and constants.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Purely declarative, safe, and standard.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines constants, enums, and mappings for metrics, objectives, telemetry.\n- Sources: Constants, class attributes, system version, imports.\n- Sinks & Flows: Static, no external data handling.\n- Anomalies: None; standard patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Configuration-only code, safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly interprets the code as a static configuration set with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Static constants and definitions for ML metrics/tasks.\n- Sources: Standard modules, internal constants.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external or dynamic data.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Purely declarative, safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. All reports agree on the static, configuration nature.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden logic:** None. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no eval, no exec, no cryptic patterns.\n- **External data or secrets:** No. The only external interaction is retrieving the package version via `pkg_resources`, which is standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or attack surface present)\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the code is a static configuration module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors.** All signals point to a safe, well-structured constants and mappings file for ML metrics and tasks.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, purely declarative, and intended for internal configuration in an ML framework. No action needed for security concerns.",
