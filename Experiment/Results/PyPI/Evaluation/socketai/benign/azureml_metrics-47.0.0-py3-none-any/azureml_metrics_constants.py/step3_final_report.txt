  "purpose": "Static configuration module defining constants, enums, and mappings for ML metrics, tasks, objectives, and system parameters used in an Azure ML AutoML framework.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, enum, numpy, pkg_resources; static class attributes and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Purely static data definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative collection of constants, enums, and mappings intended for internal configuration within an ML framework. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no dynamic logic, external data handling, or obfuscation. The import of 'pkg_resources' for version info is standard. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and solely serves as internal constants and mappings for ML metrics and tasks.",
