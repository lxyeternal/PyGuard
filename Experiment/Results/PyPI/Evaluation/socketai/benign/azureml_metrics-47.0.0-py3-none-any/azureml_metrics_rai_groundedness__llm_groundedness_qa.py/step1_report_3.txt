{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for computing a groundedness metric for question answering using an LLM, specifically for evaluating the quality of generated content.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include self.contexts, self.generated_contents, and self.llm_url_connector.get_llm_prediction.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the get_llm_prediction method, which sends prompts to an external LLM service; potential data leakage or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from contexts and generated_contents into prompt construction, then prompts are sent to the LLM via get_llm_prediction, and the results are post-processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, with standard logging and data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and external modules, defines a class with a compute method that constructs prompts and retrieves LLM predictions via an external connector, then processes results. No malicious behavior, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The only external communication is the call to get_llm_prediction, which is typical for such applications. There are no signs of hidden backdoors or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears to be part of a legitimate metric computation module.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard operations for a question-answering metric involving an external LLM API. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or supply chain threats. It appears to be a normal component of a machine learning evaluation pipeline.",
