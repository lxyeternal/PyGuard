  "purpose": "Constructs prompts from contexts and generated contents, then queries an external LLM API for predictions, and processes the results for a groundedness metric.",
  "sources": "Reads 'contexts' and 'generated_contents' attributes, and calls 'self.llm_url_connector.get_llm_prediction' with prompt list.",
  "sinks": "External API call; logs raw results at debug level.",
  "flows": "Constructs prompts from internal data -> sends prompts to external API -> receives raw results -> logs results -> post-processes results -> returns final scores.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Logging at debug level could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed, but this is a configuration concern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs prompt construction, external API invocation, and result post-processing in a straightforward manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The external API call is standard for such metrics, and no secrets or obfuscation are present. Logging at debug level could pose a data leak risk but is not malicious. The scores assigned in related reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the minimal security concerns related to external communication and logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. External API usage is typical for such metrics, and logging practices are a configuration issue rather than a security flaw. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero.",
