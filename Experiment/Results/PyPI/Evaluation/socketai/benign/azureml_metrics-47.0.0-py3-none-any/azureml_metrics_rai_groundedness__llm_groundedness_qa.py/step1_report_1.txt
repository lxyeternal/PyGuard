  "purpose": "Define a groundedness metric for question answering using an LLM API.",
  "sources": "Reads contexts and generated contents (self.contexts, self.generated_contents), calls an external LLM API via self.llm_url_connector.get_llm_prediction.",
  "sinks": "Calls an external API (get_llm_prediction), processes results, potentially logs debug info.",
  "flows": "Input data (contexts, generated contents) -> construct prompts -> send prompts to LLM API -> receive results -> post-process results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors. Logging level is debug, which could leak sensitive information if logs are exposed, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing a metric using an external LLM API. It constructs prompts from input contexts and generated contents, sends them to an API, logs the raw results, and processes these results. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The API call uses an external connector, which is standard. The logging level is debug, which could expose data if logs are shared, but that is a configuration choice rather than malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for an LLM-based metric with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on external API calls and processes data as expected for such a metric. No malicious or suspicious activity is identified.",
