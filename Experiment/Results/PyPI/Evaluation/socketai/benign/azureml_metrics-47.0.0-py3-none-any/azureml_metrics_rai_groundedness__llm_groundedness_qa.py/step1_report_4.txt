{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for computing groundedness metrics for question answering using a language model API.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are 'contexts' and 'generated_contents' attributes; external data is fetched via 'get_llm_prediction'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends prompt lists to 'get_llm_prediction', which could potentially be a network call to an external service.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'contexts' and 'generated_contents' into 'construct_user_prompts', then to 'get_llm_prediction', and finally to 'post_process'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are observed. Use of external API connection is standard for such functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging, numpy, and specific modules related to metrics. It defines a class that computes a groundedness score by creating prompts and requesting predictions from an external API via 'llm_url_connector.get_llm_prediction'. No sensitive data, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to perform standard metric computation, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious intent. The only external interaction is via a presumed API call, which is common for LLM-based metrics.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears legitimate, implementing a groundedness QA metric with external API calls for LLM predictions. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signs are detected.",
