{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for calculating a groundedness metric for question answering using an LLM (Large Language Model). It constructs prompts and retrieves predictions from an external LLM service.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from self.contexts and self.generated_contents, and calls self.llm_url_connector.get_llm_prediction to get predictions from an external URL-based service.",
  "sinks": "The code sends prompt data to an external LLM service via get_llm_prediction; potential data leakage depends on the data sent. No other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from self.contexts and self.generated_contents into prompt construction, then into the external get_llm_prediction call, and results are post-processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The external API call is standard for LLM integrations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for interfacing with an external LLM API to compute a metric. It constructs prompts and retrieves predictions without any suspicious logic or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling is detected. The use of external API calls is typical for LLM-based metrics.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical metric computation class interfacing with an external LLM service, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
