  "purpose": "Utilities for computing model evaluation metrics, including data processing, metric class retrieval, and label encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in metric calculations, logging, and exception raising. No network, file, or external data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through various functions for padding, encoding, decoding, and metric computation, with internal transformations and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of assertions and exception raising appears standard for validation. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Import of external libraries is conditionally handled, and no hidden or obfuscated code was found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions related to metrics calculation and data transformations. It includes functions for padding predictions, calculating total variance, encoding/decoding labels, and mapping metric names to classes. External library imports are safe and conditional, with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, and all operations appear related to model evaluation tasks. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for model evaluation, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It mainly handles data processing, metric class retrieval, and logging, following standard practices without any suspicious activities.",
