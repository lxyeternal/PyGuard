  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for ML metrics, with safe dependency handling, no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0 — negligible, as it only processes data for evaluation.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for ML evaluation, with safe handling of dependencies, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low; mainly due to handling untrusted data but no malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is sound; the slight security risk is due to potential data mishandling, not malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Functions for evaluation, with standard data handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to data processing.\n- **Justification:** The report accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions for model evaluation, with safe dependency management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no significant security concerns.\n- **Justification:** The assessment is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility code for metrics, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on a score of **0.0**. The code is purely utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on **0.0**, indicating the code is transparent and understandable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with data handling but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a collection of utility functions for model evaluation, label encoding/decoding, and metric class mapping.\n- It uses standard libraries (numpy, sklearn, azureml) with proper error handling.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- The dynamic import handling is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not malicious.\n- The code is designed for evaluation purposes, not for executing any harmful operations.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low; mainly related to data handling, not security threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and intended for model evaluation within the AzureML framework. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or sabotage.",
