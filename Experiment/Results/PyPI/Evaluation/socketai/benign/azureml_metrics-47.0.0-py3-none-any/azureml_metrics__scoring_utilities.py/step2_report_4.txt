  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk. I'll also verify the consistency of the scores with the content of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a utility library for ML metrics, with no malicious activities, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It highlights safe dependency handling and standard functions.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — consistent with no malicious behavior.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.0 — no security concerns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content. The code is standard, safe, and intended for evaluation purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes that the code is a utility for model evaluation, with standard data handling, no network activity, and safe dependency management. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still very high.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — negligible, likely due to optional dependencies or dynamic imports.\n\n- **Justification:** The minor security risk score reflects the use of optional dependencies and dynamic imports, which are standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard utility functions, label encoding, and metric mapping. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — aligns with the content.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — minimal, due to dependency handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion matches the code's nature. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes standard evaluation utilities, with safe data handling and no network or malicious activity. Proper exception handling and dependency checks are noted.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — no significant risk.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is legitimate evaluation utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report confirms the code is for metrics and data processing, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — no concerns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is well-aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All mention standard practices, safe dependency handling, and legitimate utility functions.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are minimal (0.1) in most reports, justified by optional dependencies and dynamic imports, which are common in such utility libraries.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the use of dynamic imports and exception handling for optional dependencies, which could, in theory, be misused. However, in this context, it appears to be standard practice and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the consistent safe handling and lack of malicious activity, I would set this at **0.1** or lower, reflecting very minimal potential concern due to dependency management.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the content of all reports.",
