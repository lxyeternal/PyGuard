{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for model evaluation metrics, including label encoding/decoding, prediction padding, metric class mapping, and safe data serialization. It supports various ML tasks such as classification, regression, forecasting, translation, summarization, QA, and more, primarily within the AzureML framework.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, external dependencies (scikit-learn, azureml.metrics modules), and optional modules via dynamic imports. It accesses class labels, predictions, true labels, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes logs via the logger; transforms and encodes labels; maps metric names to classes; serializes data into JSON-safe formats; performs data validation and assertions.",
  "flows": "Sources include input data arrays and external modules; data flows through label encoding/decoding, prediction padding, metric class retrieval, and JSON serialization; sinks include logs, exception raising, and data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports for optional dependencies; extensive dependency management; no network activity or code injection; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility module for ML evaluation within AzureML, employing standard practices such as dependency checks, exception handling, label encoding, and metric mapping. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The dynamic import pattern is a common approach for optional dependencies. The functions perform data transformations, validation, and safe serialization, all consistent with legitimate utility functions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility library for ML model evaluation tasks. It employs standard practices, handles dependencies cautiously, and performs data processing securely. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
