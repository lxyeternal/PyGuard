{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for evaluating machine learning models, including metrics calculation, label encoding/decoding, and data validation within the AzureML framework.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules such as numpy, sklearn, and azureml.metrics. Specifically, sources include y_pred_probs, train_labels, class_labels, y_test, y_pred, class_labels, and external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data transformations (e.g., inverse_transform, fit_transform), array manipulations, and data serialization via make_json_safe. No direct data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., y_test, y_pred, class_labels), through encoding/decoding functions, into model metric calculations and data padding functions. No external network communication or unsafe code execution is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or anomalous code segments, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. All external imports are standard libraries or well-known packages (numpy, sklearn). No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Usage of try-except blocks for optional dependencies is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for padding predictions, calculating variance, encoding/decoding labels, and selecting metric classes. It includes dynamic import handling for optional dependencies, proper error handling, and logging. No signs of malicious intent such as code injection, system modification, or data exfiltration are present. The focus is on machine learning evaluation metrics, with legitimate utility functions. The code operates locally and securely on data passed as arguments, with no network calls or external data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for model evaluation within AzureML. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. All observed activities are consistent with legitimate metric calculation and data handling routines. The malware score is low, and the security risk score is negligible.",
