  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential risks, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a safe utility library for ML metrics, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is standard, with dependency checks, safe data handling, and no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for ML evaluation, with standard data handling, no network activity, and proper dependency management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, acknowledging minimal risk due to dependency handling.\n\n**Justification for Risk Score:** Given the code only manipulates data, performs encoding/decoding, and maps metrics, the low risk score is appropriate. The only slight concern is the use of dynamic imports and data transformations, but these are standard practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard utility functions, no malicious activities, legitimate data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — negligible security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions, safe data handling, no network activity, proper exception handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for model evaluation, no suspicious activity, standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The code is purely utility-focused, with safe dependency handling and no network or system modifications.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.0–0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard utility module for ML model evaluation, with functions for label encoding/decoding, prediction padding, metric class mapping, and safe data serialization. It employs proper exception handling, dependency checks, and logging. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The dynamic imports are for optional dependencies and are handled safely.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dependency handling and data transformations, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
