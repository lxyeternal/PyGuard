{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for evaluating machine learning model metrics, including data encoding/decoding, metric class retrieval, JSON safety conversion, and logging.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, class attributes, and imports modules; notably, it reads input data (arrays, labels, configurations) and environment variables via imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to sklearn functions, logging functions, and exception raisers; no explicit data leaks or external connections are evident within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes into encoding/decoding functions, metric calculation functions, and logging/error handling routines; no external network communication or data exfiltration is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Usage of dynamic imports is limited to optional dependencies with safe exception handling. No suspicious or obfuscated code constructs are present. All external dependencies are properly handled with import checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is predominantly standard utility functions for metric computation, label encoding/decoding, and class mapping for ML evaluation. It uses well-known libraries such as sklearn and numpy, with appropriate error handling and dependency checks. No malicious network activity, data theft, or sabotage code is found. The logic is consistent with data processing, and there are no signs of obfuscation or hidden code. The presence of optional imports with safe fallback indicates deliberate design rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code is intended for evaluation purposes and does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as a utility library for ML metric evaluation, with appropriate safety checks and no suspicious activities.",
