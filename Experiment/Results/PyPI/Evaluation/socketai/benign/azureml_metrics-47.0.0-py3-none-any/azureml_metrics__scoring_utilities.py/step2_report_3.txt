  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, data flow, and potential security concerns.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, noting the code is mainly utility functions for metrics evaluation. They highlight proper dependency handling, no obfuscation, and safe data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Justification:** The code performs standard ML evaluation tasks with no signs of malicious activity. The high confidence (1.0) aligns with this.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling, dependency checks, and no network activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still indicating safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected. The small risk score might reflect the presence of dynamic imports or optional dependencies, but these are standard practices.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer notes extensive data handling and mapping, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of dynamic imports and label encoding is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent observed. The slightly higher risk score could be due to complex dependency management, but overall safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer confirms the code is standard utility functions for evaluation, with proper handling of dependencies and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Justification:** Clear, legitimate utility code with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes the code is legitimate, handling data processing and metric retrieval securely, with no suspicious activities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is safe and performs legitimate utility functions.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None apparent; all reports are consistent and thorough.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. Risk scores are mostly 0 or very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Malware Justification:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code's purpose is evaluation and data handling, which is standard.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0–0.1** — Very low, mainly due to dependency complexity, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate utility module for model evaluation with no malicious or sabotage indicators. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
