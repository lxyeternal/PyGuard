{
  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ attribute for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a modified __path__ via 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil' without any external input or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a standard package resource extension; no suspicious or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' on the '__path__' variable, which is a common pattern in Python packages for namespace package support. The code does not read any external input, does not handle untrusted data, and is a minimal, standard package setup. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or obfuscated elements. The only operation is an extension of the package's search path for resource discovery.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package pattern used for namespace package support and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
