  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' module and calling extend_path on __path__ with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> call to extend_path() on __path__ with __name__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ to support namespace packages. It is a minimal, straightforward pattern used in Python packaging. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is well-understood and common in Python projects. All reports correctly identify it as benign. No obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious intent are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriate at 0, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package support with no security risks or malicious behavior. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
