  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ variable to support namespace packaging.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil') statement reading the 'pkgutil' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being sent or used in a way that leads to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path() with __path__ and __name__, modifying __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import and modifies __path__, which is typical for namespace packages; no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ for the current package/module, a common pattern for supporting namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No input/output sources are involved, and no data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of namespace package extension and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
