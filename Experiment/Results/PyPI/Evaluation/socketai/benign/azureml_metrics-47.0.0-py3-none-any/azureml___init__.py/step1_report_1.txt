{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package resolution",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system state or leaks occur",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, passes them to 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil'",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only standard library usage; no anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code modifies __path__ using 'pkgutil.extend_path', a common pattern in namespace packages to merge multiple directories for package resolution. It involves standard library functions with no suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of package namespace handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for handling namespace packages in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
