  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "The line importing 'pkgutil' and the extension of __path__",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; usage of __import__ and extend_path is standard for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ with the current __path__ and __name__, which is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package support in Python and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
