  "purpose": "Assign version strings to variables, likely for version comparison or display.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data usage present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to critical functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward assignment with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version strings to two variables. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. It does not contain any obfuscation, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors. This appears to be a standard version declaration snippet, common in many codebases for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward version assignment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
