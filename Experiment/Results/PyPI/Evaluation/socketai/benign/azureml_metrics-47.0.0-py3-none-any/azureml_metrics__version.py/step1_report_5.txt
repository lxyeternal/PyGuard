  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to be part of a larger versioning scheme or package metadata. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward version assignment with no malicious behavior detected.",
