  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings to two variables. There is no input handling, data leakage, or malicious activity. The simplicity and lack of external data or functions indicate routine version assignment. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard version assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
