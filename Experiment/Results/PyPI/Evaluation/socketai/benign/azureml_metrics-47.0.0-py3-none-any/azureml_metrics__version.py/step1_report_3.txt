  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; variables are statically assigned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple static assignment with no dynamic or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings to two variables, which is common for version control and does not involve any data input or sensitive information. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only basic variable assignments for version strings with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
