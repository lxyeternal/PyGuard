  "purpose": "Define version strings for software components or dependencies.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, input/output, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignments with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant version variables without context or usage; no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments for version strings, with no input, output, or external data processing. There are no functions, network calls, or sensitive operations. The repetition of version strings appears to be either placeholder or configuration code. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected based on this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply setting version variables with no malicious or security concerns.",
