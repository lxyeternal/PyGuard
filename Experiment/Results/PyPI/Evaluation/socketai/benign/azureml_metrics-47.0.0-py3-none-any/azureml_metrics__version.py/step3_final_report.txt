  "purpose": "Assigns version strings to variables for version management or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments are isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with simple variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string assignments defining version numbers. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
