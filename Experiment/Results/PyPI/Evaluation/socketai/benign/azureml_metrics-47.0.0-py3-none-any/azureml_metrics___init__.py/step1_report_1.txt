{
  "purpose": "This code provides metric computation classes and functions for Azure Machine Learning, serving as an interface for metric-related operations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules, system modules, and environment via __import__ and sys.modules.",
  "targets": "No direct sinks are present that process untrusted data or execute external commands. The code only sets up module attributes and imports.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating security issues; mainly module setup and import flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns. The use of __import__ and extend_path is standard for package extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes, handles versioning with a try-except block, and extends module path. All actions are standard for Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script for AzureML metrics modules with no malicious intent. It mainly manages module imports, versioning, and path extension. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
