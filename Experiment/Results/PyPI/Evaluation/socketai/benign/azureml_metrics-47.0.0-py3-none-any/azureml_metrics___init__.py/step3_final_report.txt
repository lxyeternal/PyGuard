  "purpose": "Standard package initialization for Azure Machine Learning metrics module, importing functions, handling version info, and extending __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._score, azureml.metrics.common.azureml_custom_prompt_metric, and dynamic extension of __path__ via pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and version handling are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil').extend_path for namespace package support, which is typical but slightly unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with standard imports, version handling, and namespace extension. No user input, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected. The use of extend_path is common in namespace packages and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The minor unusual pattern of extending __path__ is justified by namespace package practices and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package module for AzureML, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior. The slight risk score assigned due to namespace extension is justified and minimal. Overall, the code is safe and the scores are appropriate.",
