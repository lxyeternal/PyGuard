{
  "purpose": "This code defines metrics computation classes and functions for Azure Machine Learning, managing imports and exports for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, local modules (_score, azureml metrics), and dynamic extension path via pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no network calls, or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "Imports and module version handling flow from package modules and sys.modules to internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) for dynamic path extension; version import with try-except; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, version handling, and exports. It includes standard practices for package setup and versioning. The use of extend_path for package extension is typical in complex Python packages. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious constructs are evident. The code does not perform any input/output operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package module for Azure ML metrics with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. The use of dynamic path extension and version import is normal for such packages.",
