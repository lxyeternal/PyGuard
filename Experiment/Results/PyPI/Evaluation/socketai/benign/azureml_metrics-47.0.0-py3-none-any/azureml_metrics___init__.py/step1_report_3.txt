{
  "purpose": "This module provides metrics computation classes and functions for Azure Machine Learning, facilitating metrics listing, scoring, and custom metric handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (. _score, azureml.metrics.common) and sys.modules to set __version__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communications; no code injections or unsafe operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks that could cause harm; mainly imports and version handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of extend_path for package path extension is standard; no suspicious code or hardcoded credentials observed",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports modules and defines package exports. It handles versioning with try-except for optional import, which is standard. No external network activity, no eval or exec, and no suspicious dynamic code. The __path__ modification is typical for namespace packages. Overall, the code appears to be a normal package initialization script without malicious intent or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package module for Azure ML metrics with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard imports, version handling, and package setup, all consistent with benign package code.",
