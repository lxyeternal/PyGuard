{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports metrics computation classes and functions for Azure Machine Learning, facilitating metrics listing and version handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys), local modules (_score, azureml.metrics.common.azureml_custom_prompt_metric, and _version). Reads __path__ and __name__ variables, and attempts to import version info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted input; code mainly sets up module exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) suggests dynamic modification of module search paths, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module setup: imports, defining __all__, handling version info with a fallback, and extending the module path dynamically. No input sources or sinks are present that could be exploited. The dynamic extension of __path__ is unusual but typical in package namespace packages. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate part of Azure ML SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only slightly unusual aspect is the dynamic path extension, which is standard in namespace packages. Overall, the code is safe.",
