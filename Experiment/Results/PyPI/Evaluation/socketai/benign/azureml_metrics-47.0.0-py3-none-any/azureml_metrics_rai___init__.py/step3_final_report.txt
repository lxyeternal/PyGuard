  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely comments with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment header with no functions, variables, or executable statements. There are no sources of input, sinks for data output, or data flows. The absence of code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior indicates a benign snippet. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the content. No anomalies or malicious signals are present. The code does not perform any operations or contain any potential vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign comment with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scoring is accurate and justified, reflecting a safe and non-malicious state.",
