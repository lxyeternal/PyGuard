  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately describes the code as a metrics computation framework for various ML tasks. Data flows from inputs (y_test, y_pred, y_pred_proba) into validation, then into task-specific metric functions. Logging is used but appears standard.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Logging could potentially leak sensitive info if input data contains secrets, but this is mitigated via telemetry controls.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The confidence is high (0.95), given the thorough review.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is sound. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed. The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on external parameters like `openai_params`. It notes potential sensitive data in logs but finds no malicious code.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** External parameters like `openai_params` could contain secrets, but no hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated code or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the findings. Confidence is again high (0.95).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Highlights extensive validation, support for multiple tasks, and telemetry logging. No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** Logging sensitive info is possible but controlled. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, matching the analysis. Confidence is perfect (1.0).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focuses on telemetry, validation, and model prediction workflows. No suspicious external calls or code patterns.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** Logging could leak sensitive info but is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the review. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to potential info leakage in logs, which is acceptable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes the code as a standard ML metrics utility with validation, logging, and task-specific functions. No suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** Logging could expose sensitive info but is within normal bounds.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, aligning with the analysis. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code is a typical evaluation utility with no malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly around 0.1–0.2, acknowledging potential info leakage via logs but no significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to logging practices that could leak sensitive info if data is not sanitized, but overall very safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured ML evaluation framework with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
