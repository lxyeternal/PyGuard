{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive framework for computing evaluation metrics across various machine learning tasks, including validation, logging, and task-specific metric calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as y_test, y_pred, y_pred_proba, external configs like openai_params, custom_dimensions, and model predictions.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs which may include sensitive data; external API parameters; exception messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation routines into task-specific metric functions, with logging and telemetry capturing execution details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. Logging could potentially expose sensitive info if inputs contain secrets, but this is controlled via telemetry settings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured evaluation utility supporting multiple ML tasks. It performs input validation, supports various metric computations, and includes telemetry logging. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External parameters like openai_params are used for specific tasks but show no signs of malicious intent. The logging practices are typical for telemetry and do not indicate malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's clarity and functionality. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.95).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent, and standard evaluation utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk pertains mainly to potential info leakage via verbose logs, which is a common trade-off in telemetry-enabled systems. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
