{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to compute, score, and list metrics for various machine learning tasks, mainly for AzureML integration.",
  "sources": "Inputs include function parameters such as y_test, y_pred, y_pred_proba, model, X_test, and various kwargs; also external modules and data from the model object.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging outputs, data returned from functions, and any external API calls within compute_metrics functions or model.predict methods.",
  "flows": "Sources like y_test, y_pred, and model predictions flow into compute_metrics or model.predict, which then may call various compute_metrics_* functions; outputs are aggregated and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Logging is used for telemetry; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The use of external modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation for computing and managing ML metrics. Validation functions check input formats, and there are multiple task-specific compute functions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. Logging and telemetry are used for monitoring, not data exfiltration. External API calls and model predictions are standard. No suspicious data handling or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a machine learning metrics library with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It is designed for AzureML metric computation and listing, with proper validation and telemetry, but no indicators of malware or security risks.",
