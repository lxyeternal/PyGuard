  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim with minor flaws in version detection and function definitions. No malware or malicious intent is present. The security risk is low, primarily due to potential runtime errors from version comparison logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1."
