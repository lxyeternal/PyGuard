{
  "purpose": "A helper utility for iterating over sequences with additional context, primarily designed for use in templates to manage loop metadata such as first, last, previous, next, etc.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequence during initialization and iteration; accesses object attributes and sequence length for group comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Uses attribute access and comparison operations; does not perform any data writes or untrusted data handling that could lead to leaks or injection.",
  "flows": "Sequence data flows into looper and loop_pos objects; attribute and method calls compare item attributes; no external data flows into or out of network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; usage of sys.version comparison is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscated code or malicious system calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured iteration mechanism with contextual metadata for templates. It reads sequences and iterates with position-aware objects. The comparison methods allow grouping logic based on attributes or functions. There are no external data injections, no network calls, nor any code that manipulates or leaks data maliciously. The code relies solely on standard sequence operations and object attribute access. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed to facilitate template loops with context information. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a standard implementation for sequence iteration with group detection features.",
