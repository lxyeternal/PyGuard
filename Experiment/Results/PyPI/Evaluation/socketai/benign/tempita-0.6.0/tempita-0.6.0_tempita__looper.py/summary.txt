  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign sequence iteration utility with contextual features, suitable for templating. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The only minor concern is the use of 'getattr' on sequence items, which could be exploited if items are maliciously crafted objects. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting cautious awareness of potential misuse. Overall, the code is safe for use in typical environments."
