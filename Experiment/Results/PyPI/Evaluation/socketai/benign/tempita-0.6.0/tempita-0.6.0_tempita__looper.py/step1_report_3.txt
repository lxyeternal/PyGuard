{
  "purpose": "A helper module designed to facilitate enhanced looping capabilities in templates, providing context such as position, group changes, and neighboring items.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the input sequence provided to the looper class during initialization, and from sys.version for Python version checks.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences system-critical operations or external systems. No use of network, file I/O, or environment variables that could leak data.",
  "flows": "Input sequence is processed in looper_iter, with each item and its position passed to loop_pos. The properties allow querying neighboring and positional information, with no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs version-based conditional definitions for Python 2 and 3 compatibility, which is standard. The use of __next__ and next property could be misused if dynamically modified, but no immediate malicious pattern is observed. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The module provides a structured way to iterate over sequences with contextual information, primarily intended for templating. It uses standard Python constructs, with version checks for compatibility. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security-sensitive operations are detected. The functions operate on input data without side effects or external communications. The properties and methods focus on data inspection and comparison, without exposing or leaking sensitive data or performing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured helper for sequence iteration with contextual awareness, intended for template rendering. It contains no malicious or suspicious code patterns, and adheres to standard practices. No security risks or malware behaviors are identified.",
