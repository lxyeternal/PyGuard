  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'Tempita' Python package, including metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata and configuration; no input data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only sets package information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines package metadata such as version, description, author info, and package data. It only performs static configuration for packaging. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or execution of untrusted code. The code is straightforward and common for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
