  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'Tempita' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read in this code.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code purely specifies package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and uses it to define package metadata such as name, version, description, classifiers, author info, URL, license, and package contents. All information appears to be static and intended for package setup. There are no dynamic or external data sources, no code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious patterns observed. The code is a standard setup script consistent with open-source Python package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is unlikely to pose any security risk or contain malware.",
