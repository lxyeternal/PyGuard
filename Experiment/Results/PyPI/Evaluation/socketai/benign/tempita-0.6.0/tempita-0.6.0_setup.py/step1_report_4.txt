  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools. It defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author, URL, and classifiers. There are no external input sources, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. It does not contain any code that interacts with the system outside of package configuration. No malicious or maliciously intended code elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
