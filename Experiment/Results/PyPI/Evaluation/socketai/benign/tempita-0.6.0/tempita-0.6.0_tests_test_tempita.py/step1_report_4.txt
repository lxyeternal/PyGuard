  "purpose": "The code is designed to run unit tests and doctests on specified files, likely as part of a testing suite for a project.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the files '../README.rst' and 'tests.txt' used by doctest.testfile.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or system modification.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the test files into the doctest framework for validation; there are no external or untrusted data flows that lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a unittest class with two test methods. Each method runs doctest on a specific file. There is no code that executes untrusted data or performs any system modifications. It uses standard testing practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple testing setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a project's testing framework.",
