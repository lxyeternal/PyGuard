  "purpose": "A simple testing harness that runs doctests on documentation and test files.",
  "sources": "Reading files '../README.rst' and 'tests.txt' for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow or external data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "File reading operations for testing documentation and code templates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward use of unittest and doctest.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a test class with two methods, each executing doctest on specific files. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or modify system state. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with the code's behavior. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious activity. The code serves as a standard testing setup for documentation and code validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward testing script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
