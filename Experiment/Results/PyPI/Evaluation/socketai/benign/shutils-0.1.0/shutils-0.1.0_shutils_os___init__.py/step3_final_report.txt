  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, external data fetches, environment variables, network connections, file operations, or code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to security issues or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "From sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, unusual code constructs, or dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code, all reports correctly identify the lack of code and refrain from unwarranted risk attribution. Descriptions of benign scripts align with low threat levels. Confidence scores are high where analysis is possible, and low where code is missing. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (0.0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The reasoning across reports is coherent and justified, with no contradictions or suspicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and appropriately cautious, accurately reflecting the limited information. No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code is present, and security risks are minimal. The scores are justified and align with the provided descriptions. No adjustments are necessary.",
