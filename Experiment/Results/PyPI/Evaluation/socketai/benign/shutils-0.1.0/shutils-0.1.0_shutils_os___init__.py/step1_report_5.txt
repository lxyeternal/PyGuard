  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for handling data processing or configuration management, but without seeing actual code, this is an assumption based on typical code structure.",
  "sources": "Potential sources could include environment variables, user input, configuration files, or network data, but no specific sources are identifiable without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file writes, network transmissions, or database operations, but no specific sinks are identified without code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink flows can be determined without the code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident without the actual code. Absence of code precludes detection of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information is available to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. The absence of code prevents identification of data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of provided code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears benign or unreviewable due to absence of content.",
