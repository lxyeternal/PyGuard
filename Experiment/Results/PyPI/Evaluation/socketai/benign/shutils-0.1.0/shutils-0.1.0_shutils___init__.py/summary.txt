  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 1's use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data justifies a moderate security risk score (~0.45) and obfuscated score (~0.4). Overall, the supply chain risk is low to moderate (~0.3), but eval/exec practices warrant caution. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with the primary concern being potential unsafe eval/exec usage. The overall assessment suggests a low likelihood of active malicious payloads but highlights insecure coding patterns that could be exploited."
