{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be designed for data processing or network communication based on its structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external network sources if network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network sockets, written to files, or logged; untrusted input could reach these sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external inputs through functions and possibly to network or file output sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or system damage are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic. It does not perform suspicious network activity, code injection, or access sensitive system resources unexpectedly. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no unusual constructs are present. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads suggests a benign purpose. However, limited context restricts full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be normal, functional, and free from supply chain threats.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
