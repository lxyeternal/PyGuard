{
  "purpose": "The function recursively cleans a specified directory by removing '.DS_Store' files and empty directories, skipping '.svn' directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads directory listings via os.listdir(_dir) and checks for specific filenames; it also accesses and removes files via os.remove and checks directory contents with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "Potentially deletes files using os.remove; removes directories with os.rmdir.",
  "flows": "The code reads directory contents, filters specific files/directories, deletes certain files, and removes empty directories if found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; no dynamic code execution; straightforward directory cleanup logic; no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard directory cleanup script that removes '.DS_Store' files and deletes empty directories, skipping '.svn' directories. It does not process user input beyond directory paths, nor does it perform network operations, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The logic is simple and predictable, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical directory cleanup utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs file system operations for maintenance purposes.",
