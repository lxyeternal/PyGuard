  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward directory cleanup utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk is due to filesystem operations that could be misused if input paths are untrusted, but this is inherent to such maintenance scripts. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
