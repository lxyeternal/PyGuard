  "purpose": "The function 'cleandir' recursively cleans a directory by deleting '.DS_Store' files and removing empty directories, with the exception of directories named '.svn'.",
  "sources": "Reads directory listings via os.listdir(_dir), checks directory and file names, and performs file removal with os.remove().",
  "sinks": "Deletes files ('os.remove') and directories ('os.rmdir') based on certain conditions.",
  "flows": "Reads directory contents; upon finding '.DS_Store', deletes it; skips '.svn'; recursively processes subdirectories; deletes directories if empty after cleaning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions detected. The code performs standard directory cleanup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward recursive directory cleanup, removing specific system files and empty folders, and skips certain directories. No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It functions solely to maintain directory cleanliness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard directory cleanup tasks without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
