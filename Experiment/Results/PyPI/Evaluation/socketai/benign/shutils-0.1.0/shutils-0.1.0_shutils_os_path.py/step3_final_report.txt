  "purpose": "Recursively deletes '.DS_Store' files and removes empty directories, skipping directories named '.svn'.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories and files accessed via os.listdir(), os.path.isdir(), os.remove(), and os.rmdir().",
  "sinks": "Deletion of specific files and directories using os.remove() and os.rmdir().",
  "flows": "Directory traversal from the initial path through recursive calls, deleting '.DS_Store' files and removing empty directories.",
  "anomalies": "Minor redundancy in appending os.path.sep in recursive calls; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem cleanup: deleting specific files and removing empty directories while skipping '.svn'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of standard os module functions indicates safe, intended operations. The potential risk exists if the input directory is maliciously controlled, but this is typical for such scripts and does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward directory cleanup utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk is due to filesystem operations that could be misused if input paths are untrusted, but this is inherent to such maintenance scripts. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
