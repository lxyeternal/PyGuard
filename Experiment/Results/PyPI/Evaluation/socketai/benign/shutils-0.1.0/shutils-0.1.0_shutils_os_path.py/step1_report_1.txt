  "purpose": "The code recursively cleans a directory by removing '.DS_Store' files and empty directories, skipping '.svn' directories.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents using os.listdir(), checks for specific filenames, and joins paths with os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "Performs file deletion with os.remove() and directory removal with os.rmdir() based on certain conditions",
  "flows": "Reads directory contents -> identifies specific files or subdirectories -> deletes files or removes empty directories",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code straightforwardly deletes specific files and directories. Slightly redundant appending of os.path.sep, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for directory cleanup tasks, specifically removing '.DS_Store' files and empty directories, while skipping '.svn' directories. It uses standard os module functions for directory traversal and file operations. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows are present. The logic is simple and typical for maintenance scripts, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a safe directory cleanup operation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code appears legitimate and intended for system maintenance.",
