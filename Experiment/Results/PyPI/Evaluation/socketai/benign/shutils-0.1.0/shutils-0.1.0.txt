      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 1's use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data justifies a moderate security risk score (~0.45) and obfuscated score (~0.4). Overall, the supply chain risk is low to moderate (~0.3), but eval/exec practices warrant caution. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with the primary concern being potential unsafe eval/exec usage. The overall assessment suggests a low likelihood of active malicious payloads but highlights insecure coding patterns that could be exploited."

The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, it is safe for use in production environments."

The low security risk is due to filesystem operations that could be misused if input paths are untrusted, but this is inherent to such maintenance scripts. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
