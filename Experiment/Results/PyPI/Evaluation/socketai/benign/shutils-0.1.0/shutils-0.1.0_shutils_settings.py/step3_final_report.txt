{
  "purpose": "A singleton class 'Settings' that loads 'config.ini' files from the current and parent directories to manage configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Reads 'config.ini' files from the script's directory and its parent directories using 'sys.argv[0]' to determine the script path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only reads configuration files without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Traverses directory hierarchy from script location upward, reading configuration files in reverse order.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'sys.argv[0]' for path resolution, which can be unreliable in some environments but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard singleton pattern for configuration management, loading multiple 'config.ini' files from the directory hierarchy. It does not perform any code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The directory traversal and file reading are typical patterns. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on 'sys.argv[0]' is a known limitation but not a security risk. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration loader using singleton pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
