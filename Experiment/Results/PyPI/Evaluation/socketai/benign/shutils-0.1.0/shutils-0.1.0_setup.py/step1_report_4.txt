  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'shutils', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in sinks; no code executes untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script primarily defines package metadata and reads a static file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools, specifies required dependencies, reads the README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious operations. The package information appears standard for open-source Python packaging, and dependencies are well-known. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
