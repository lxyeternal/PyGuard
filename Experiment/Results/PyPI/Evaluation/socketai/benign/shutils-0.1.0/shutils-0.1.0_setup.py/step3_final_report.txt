  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses explicit dependencies ('configparser', 'pymysql').",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static file, passes metadata to setuptools; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script. It imports setuptools, reads a local README file, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted input handling is present. All dependencies are standard, and the code is clear and transparent. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code aligns with best practices for open-source package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
