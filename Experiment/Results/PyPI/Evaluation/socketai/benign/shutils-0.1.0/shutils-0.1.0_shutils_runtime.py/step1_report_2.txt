  "purpose": "This code is designed to restart the current Python process after an optional delay.",
  "sources": "Reads the current executable path from sys.executable and command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Calls os.execl to replace the current process with a new process using the same Python executable and arguments.",
  "flows": "Sources (sys.executable, sys.argv) → sink (os.execl) which restarts the process with the same parameters after a delay.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.execl to restart the process, which can be exploited if combined with malicious code or used to create persistent processes. No input validation or checks are present, but the code itself is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a restart function that pauses for a specified delay, then restarts the current Python process with the same command-line arguments. The restart behavior can be used legitimately for updates or recovery, but it can also be exploited to create persistent or looping processes, potentially masking malicious activity or causing denial of service. No malicious code or backdoors are evident within this snippet; it is a simple restart utility. The code does not handle untrusted input but is minimal and transparent in function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward process restart utility. While not inherently malicious, its use in malicious contexts (such as persistent restart loops) is possible. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is low but should be monitored if used improperly.",
