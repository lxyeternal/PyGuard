  "purpose": "Provides a process restart function that optionally delays before replacing the current process with a new one using the same command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.executable, sys.argv, os.execl",
  "sinks": "os.execl (replaces current process with a new process)",
  "flows": "sys.argv and sys.executable as input sources flow into os.execl to restart the process",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional restart without validation; potential for infinite loops or misuse if invoked repeatedly",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, utilizing standard libraries to restart the current Python process after an optional delay. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hardcoded secrets are present. Its behavior can be exploited in malicious contexts (e.g., persistent loops, evasion), but inherently, it is a benign utility. The potential for misuse is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and potential for misuse depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign process restart utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its capability to restart processes can be exploited maliciously if misused, but the code itself is safe. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
