  "purpose": "Establish and manage MySQL database connections with singleton pattern and execute queries",
  "sources": "connection_string parameter passed to __init__, settings retrieval for connection parameters",
  "sinks": "pymysql.connect(), execute(), select_db(), set_charset()",
  "flows": "connection_string -> parsing -> pymysql.connect() -> execute queries -> fetch results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual data handling or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a MySQL connection from a connection string, manages singleton instances, and provides methods to execute and fetch query results. It properly manages resource cleanup in __del__. The connection parameters are parsed from a string and used securely, with no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution. The use of parameters in execute functions reduces SQL injection risks. The code does not perform any network communication beyond standard database connection, nor does it include obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard database connection and query handler with proper resource management and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It is a typical implementation with appropriate security practices.",
