  "purpose": "Manage MySQL database connections using a singleton pattern, providing methods for executing queries and fetching results.",
  "sources": "Connection string parsed from Settings singleton; input data in query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Query execution with parameterized queries; no direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Connection string parsing -> establishing connection -> executing parameterized queries -> fetching results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Connection string parsing from external settings is standard but could be risky if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for managing MySQL connections, parsing connection parameters from an external configuration. It uses parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection, manages resources properly in __del__, and avoids hardcoded secrets. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The connection string reliance on external configuration is typical but warrants caution if configuration integrity is compromised. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The code aligns with best practices for database connection management, with no internal vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured database connection handler with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, it is safe for use in production environments.",
