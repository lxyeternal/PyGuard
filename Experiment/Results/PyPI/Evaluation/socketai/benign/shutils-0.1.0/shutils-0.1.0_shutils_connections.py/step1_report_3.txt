  "purpose": "Establishes and manages MySQL database connections using provided connection strings, implementing singleton pattern for connection reuse.",
  "sources": "Reads connection string from Settings singleton; extracts host, user, password, database, charset; takes query and parameters as input to execute methods.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL queries with parameters via __cursor.execute, which could be vulnerable if queries are improperly sanitized, but the code itself does not demonstrate injection vulnerabilities; no other data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Connection string parsing -> __init__ method -> pymysql.connect() -> execute/query methods -> database operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses connection string parsing from a setting file, but does not sanitize or validate connection parameters beyond splitting; no hardcoded credentials; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a singleton database connection manager with standard practices: parsing connection string, establishing connection, setting charset and autocommit, and providing query methods. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity. The code relies on external configuration for credentials and does not log or transmit data elsewhere. It uses standard pymysql functions safely. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate database connection utility. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It handles connection setup and query execution in a typical manner without any signs of malware or security risks.",
