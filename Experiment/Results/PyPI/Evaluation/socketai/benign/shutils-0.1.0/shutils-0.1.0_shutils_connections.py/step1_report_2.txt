  "purpose": "Establishes and manages a MySQL database connection with singleton pattern, executing SQL queries.",
  "sources": "Reading connection string from Settings, input parameters to execute, query, queryAll, queryOne methods.",
  "sinks": "Executing SQL queries via __cursor.execute() with untrusted query input.",
  "flows": "Input connection string from Settings -> parsing to connection parameters -> pymysql.connect() -> query execution via __cursor.execute() -> fetch results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; connection string dynamically parsed. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No signs of data leakage or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically parses connection string parameters to establish a MySQL connection. It uses standard pymysql library functions to execute queries and fetch results. The connection details are retrieved from a Settings singleton, not hardcoded. Query methods directly execute provided query strings with parameters, which is a standard practice. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of connection pooling or singleton pattern is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual data flows detected. Overall, the code appears to perform expected database operations securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of database connection management with safe query execution. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appropriately manages resources and uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, assuming callers supply safe queries.",
