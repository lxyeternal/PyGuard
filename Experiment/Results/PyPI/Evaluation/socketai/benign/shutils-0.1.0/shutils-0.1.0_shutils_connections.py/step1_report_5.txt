  "purpose": "Provides a singleton MySQL database connection class with methods to execute queries and fetch results.",
  "sources": "Reads connection configuration from the Settings class and connection string parsing.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL queries via __cursor.execute() with provided query and parameters.",
  "flows": "Connection string parsing from configuration -> Creation of pymysql connection object -> Query execution via execute(), queryAll(), queryOne() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic connection string parsing is standard but should be verified to prevent injection, which is mitigated by parameterized queries.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages database connections, using parameterized queries for SQL execution, which helps prevent SQL injection. Connection strings are parsed from settings, avoiding hardcoded credentials. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code structure follows best practices for resource management. No obfuscation or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of a singleton MySQL connection manager with safe query execution. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
