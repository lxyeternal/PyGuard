{
  "purpose": "This script updates Python sample files with a specified license header, ensuring consistent licensing across samples.",
  "sources": "Reads the license file to load license header lines; reads and writes Python sample files (.py) to insert license headers.",
  "sinks": "File operations such as reading license and sample files, writing modified sample files.",
  "flows": "Reads license content -> processes each Python file -> prepends license header -> overwrites original files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard file I/O and directory traversal. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory traversal to locate Python files, reads a license template, and inserts this header into each sample file after skipping initial comments or empty lines. The code uses straightforward file I/O, list manipulations, and argument parsing. There are no indications of malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic appears to be for license management. The only minor concern is the reliance on the license buffer being properly loaded; however, this does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing license headers in Python samples. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs standard file processing tasks with no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
