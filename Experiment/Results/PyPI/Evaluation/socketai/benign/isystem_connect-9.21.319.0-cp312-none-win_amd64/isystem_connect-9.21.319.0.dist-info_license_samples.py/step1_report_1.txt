  "purpose": "The script is designed to add or replace license headers in Python sample files within a specified directory.",
  "sources": "User-supplied paths for the directory containing Python files ('--path') and the license file ('--license').",
  "sinks": "File write operations that overwrite Python sample files with updated license headers.",
  "flows": "Reads license content from a file, processes Python files in the directory, and rewrites them with updated license headers.",
  "anomalies": "None evident; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward file operations without external data injections or system command executions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse to parse user input for directory and license file paths. It reads the license file and stores its lines in a global list 'license_buffer'. The 'walk_dir' function traverses the directory tree, processing all '.py' files by invoking 'fix_sample'. The 'fix_sample' function reads each Python file, skips existing license comments at the top, ensures proper formatting by adding a newline if necessary, and prepends the license header. It then overwrites the original file with the updated content. The script runs this process on execution, reporting the number of files modified. No untrusted data handling, command injection, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for batch updating license headers in Python files. It performs standard file operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any network activity, credential handling, or other malicious behaviors.",
