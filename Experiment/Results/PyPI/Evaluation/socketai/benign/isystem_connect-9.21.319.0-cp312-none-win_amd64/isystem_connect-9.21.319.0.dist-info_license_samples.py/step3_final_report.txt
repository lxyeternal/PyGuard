  "purpose": "Utility script to update or replace license headers in Python sample files within a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reads license content from a provided license file; traverses directory tree to locate Python files.",
  "sinks": "Overwrites original Python files with updated license headers; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Reads license file -> loads into global buffer -> traverses files -> skips initial comments -> prepends license header -> writes back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file I/O; minor note that license_buffer is loaded once; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic file reading and writing operations to prepend license headers to Python files. It skips initial comment lines to preserve existing license comments. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The license buffer is loaded once at startup, which is efficient and safe. The code does not handle exceptions explicitly, but this does not impact security assessment. Overall, the code is a benign utility for license management with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign license header updater. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores should be zero as well, since no malicious or risky operations are performed. The code poses minimal security concern, primarily related to file overwriting, which is inherent to its function. Minor adjustment: set the securityRisk score in report 3 from 0.2 to 0 for consistency.",
