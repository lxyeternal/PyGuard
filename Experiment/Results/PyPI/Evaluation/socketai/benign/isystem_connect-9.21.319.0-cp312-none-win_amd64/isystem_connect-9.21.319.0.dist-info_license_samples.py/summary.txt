  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign license header updater. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores should be zero as well, since no malicious or risky operations are performed. The code poses minimal security concern, primarily related to file overwriting, which is inherent to its function. Minor adjustment: set the securityRisk score in report 3 from 0.2 to 0 for consistency."
