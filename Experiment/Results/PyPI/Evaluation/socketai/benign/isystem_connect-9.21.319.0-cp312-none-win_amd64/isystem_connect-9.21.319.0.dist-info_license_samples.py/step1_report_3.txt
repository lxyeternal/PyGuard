{
  "purpose": "The script updates the license headers of Python sample files in a specified directory by prepending a license text read from a provided license file.",
  "sources": "User-provided paths via command-line arguments: --path (samples directory) and --license (license file). Files read include all Python files in the directory tree. License file read from a specified path.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated files back to the same Python source files after modifying license headers.",
  "flows": "Input paths (samples directory and license file) -> Reading license file -> Reading each Python file -> Prepending license header -> Writing back to original files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code performs straightforward file operations. The license buffer is read once and used to overwrite the header of Python files. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to specify directories and license files. It reads the license content into a global list. The 'fix_sample' function reads each Python file, skips initial comment lines, and prepends the license header, ensuring formatting consistency. The 'walk_dir' function traverses the directory tree and applies 'fix_sample' to each Python file found. The overall flow involves reading, processing, and rewriting files with no untrusted input that could lead to code execution or data leaks. The script's purpose appears to be license management, with no evident malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward license header updater with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. It only modifies file headers as intended. There are no suspicious behaviors, credential leaks, or insecure operations detected.",
