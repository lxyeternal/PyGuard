{
  "purpose": "The script updates Python sample files by replacing their license headers with a specified license from a provided file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license content from a specified license file and Python sample files in the given directory.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the updated license headers into Python sample files, overwriting their original content.",
  "flows": "License file is read into 'license_buffer'. For each Python file found, the license header is prepended by rewriting the file content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The script only modifies file headers without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads a license file and applies its content to Python files in a directory. It carefully skips empty files and preserves formatting by maintaining license header structure. The operations involve file I/O and directory traversal without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The code appears to perform a benign licensing update task.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward utility for updating license headers in Python files. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to enforce consistent licensing in code samples, with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
