{
  "purpose": "This script updates Python sample files with a specified license header, ensuring consistent license formatting across files.",
  "sources": "Reads license content from a specified license file; reads and writes Python source files in the provided directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to the same Python files after inserting license headers.",
  "flows": "Reads license file -> stores in memory -> iterates over Python files -> prepends license header -> overwrites files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and has no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input files and a license file, inserting the license as a header in Python scripts. It reads files securely, modifies them, and writes back, with no external network activity or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The logic is simple and focused on file processing, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for license management in Python source files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
