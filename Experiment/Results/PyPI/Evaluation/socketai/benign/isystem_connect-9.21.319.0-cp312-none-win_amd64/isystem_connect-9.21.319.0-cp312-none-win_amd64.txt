      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign license header updater. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores should be zero as well, since no malicious or risky operations are performed. The code poses minimal security concern, primarily related to file overwriting, which is inherent to its function. Minor adjustment: set the securityRisk score in report 3 from 0.2 to 0 for consistency."

The main concern is the minor bug in exception handling, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting minimal potential manipulation via environment variables and subprocess reliance."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for profiling data visualization with minimal security risks. The primary concern is potential command injection via unsanitized filenames passed to subprocess with 'shell=True'. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2 due to command construction practices."
