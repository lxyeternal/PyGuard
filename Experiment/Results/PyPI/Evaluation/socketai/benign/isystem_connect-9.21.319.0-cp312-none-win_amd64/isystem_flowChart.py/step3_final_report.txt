  "purpose": "Generate control flow diagrams from disassembly information for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Instruction objects, debug info, symbol data, system command to open images.",
  "sinks": "Writes dot graph files, invokes system commands to open images.",
  "flows": "Instruction data to graph nodes, debug info to labels, system call to open images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a visualization utility that processes disassembly instructions, debug info, and symbols to generate graph descriptions. It writes dot files and may invoke system commands to display images. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External system calls are typical for visualization tools and do not indicate malicious intent. The code relies on standard modules and external libraries, with no embedded secrets or malicious payloads. The control flow and data handling are straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious visualization tool for disassembly control flow analysis. It poses minimal security risk, primarily due to system calls to open images, which are standard in such utilities. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage is present.",
