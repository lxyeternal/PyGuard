{
  "purpose": "The script generates a flow chart for a function from its disassembly information, visualizing control flow and structure.",
  "sources": "Reads function disassembly and instruction data via isystem.connect modules, and source code info through debug symbols.",
  "sinks": "Generates and writes Graphviz dot files for visualization. No direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instruction parsing and symbol extraction to node and link creation, culminating in dot file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of external modules appears standard. No malicious behavior or privacy violations found.",
  "analysis": "The code processes disassembly and debugging info to produce a graph visualization of function control flow. It uses standard libraries and defined classes for nodes and links. No suspicious network activity, file modifications outside output, or stealth mechanisms are present. The functions primarily create and write dot graph descriptions. No indication of data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious logic. All code appears consistent with its purpose of visualization, with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate visualization utility for disassembly analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It uses standard practices and external libraries appropriately. No malware signals or security threats identified.",
