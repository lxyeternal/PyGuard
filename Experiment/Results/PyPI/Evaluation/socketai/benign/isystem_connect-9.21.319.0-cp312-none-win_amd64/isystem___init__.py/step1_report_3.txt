  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a module that could be used for various functions, but without additional context, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network connections if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands execution, network communications, or file writes if such code exists within the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like system commands, network requests, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis reveals the code's functions, data handling, and control flow. No suspicious behavior such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms is observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. The code lacks obfuscation or dynamic code execution that might conceal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no malicious intent apparent. However, without full context or external dependencies, some risks cannot be entirely ruled out.",
