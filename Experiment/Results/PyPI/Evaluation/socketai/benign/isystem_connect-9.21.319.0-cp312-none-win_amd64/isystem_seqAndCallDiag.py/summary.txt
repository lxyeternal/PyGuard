  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for profiling data visualization with minimal security risks. The primary concern is potential command injection via unsanitized filenames passed to subprocess with 'shell=True'. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2 due to command construction practices."
