{
  "purpose": "The script generates a call graph for a function from its symbol information using isystem APIs, outputting a DOT file and optionally opening the generated image.",
  "sources": "Reads symbol data via isystem.connect API, command-line arguments for function names, output filenames, and options.",
  "sinks": "Writes DOT graph data to a file; uses subprocess to open the generated image file.",
  "flows": "Symbol data and command-line options flow into DOT file creation; filenames flow into subprocess call for opening images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of subprocess with 'start' is standard for Windows but could be risky if filenames are manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for call graph visualization, relying on isystem APIs to gather function call data, then generating a DOT graph. The subprocess call to open images is typical but should be noted as a potential vector if filenames are externally manipulated. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for call graph generation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to the subprocess call, which is standard and controlled in this context. No signs of supply chain compromise or sabotage are evident.",
