  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the reasoning, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate call graph generator using symbol data, with no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly above zero, possibly due to subprocess usage)\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors. The subprocess call is standard for opening files and is controlled via filenames from options, not user input.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk score is low, justified by the use of subprocess, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's legitimacy and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning correctly dismisses any malicious intent, noting the use of standard modules and safe subprocess calls.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the description.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the script is a legitimate visualization tool, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning remains consistent. The only minor concern is the subprocess call, but it's used for opening files, which is typical.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No malicious activity detected, malware score at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on the benign nature.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The report notes the subprocess call with 'start' on Windows, which could be risky if inputs are uncontrolled. However, since filenames are from controlled options, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a legitimate call graph generator; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to subprocess usage)\n- **Analysis:** The only minor concern is the subprocess call with 'start', which could be exploited if filename inputs are manipulated. However, given the context, this is a standard pattern for opening files, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Justified. No malware, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, citing no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating code clarity and no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in all cases, justified by the subprocess call to open files, which could be risky if input is uncontrolled. However, in this context, filenames are controlled, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malware, malicious code, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Minor risk due to subprocess call, but overall low. Since the subprocess call is only used to open files, and filenames are controlled, I would assign a **0.1** risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The subprocess call with 'start' on Windows is a common pattern for opening files. It could be exploited if filename inputs are manipulated, but as the filename is derived from controlled options, the risk is minimal.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The code relies on trusted APIs and modules.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Conclusion:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — Reflecting the minimal potential for exploitation via subprocess, but overall very low.\n\nThe code is a legitimate, transparent utility for generating call graphs from symbol data, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
