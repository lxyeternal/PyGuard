{
  "purpose": "Implement an event handling system for Python, allowing registration, deregistration, and triggering of event handlers.",
  "sources": "User-defined event names, handlers registered via 'on' or 'once' methods.",
  "sinks": "Executing handlers with arbitrary arguments, potentially executing malicious code if handlers are malicious.",
  "flows": "Event name and handlers from registration methods flow into event storage; 'trigger' invokes handlers with provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code employs standard event system patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for missing handlers or events. The 'Observable' class manages event-handler mappings with methods to register ('on', 'once'), deregister ('off'), retrieve handlers, and trigger events. Handler functions are stored and called with user-supplied arguments. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. The design is straightforward and typical for an event system, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign event system implementation with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles event registration and invocation securely without executing untrusted code beyond calling user-supplied handlers.",
