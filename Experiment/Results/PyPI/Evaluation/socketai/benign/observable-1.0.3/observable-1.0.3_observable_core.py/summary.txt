  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard event handling implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main security risk stems from executing untrusted handlers, which is inherent to such systems. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent risk of executing untrusted code."
