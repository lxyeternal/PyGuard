  "purpose": "Declare the version number for the 'observable' package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.0.3' to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator. It contains no inputs, outputs, external data, or dynamic behavior. All reports confirm the code's simplicity and benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code aligns with standard practices for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
