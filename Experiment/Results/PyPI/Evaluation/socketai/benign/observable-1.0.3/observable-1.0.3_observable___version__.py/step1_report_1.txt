  "purpose": "Defines the version number for the observable package",
  "sources": "The line that assigns a string to __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; simple version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static string to a module-level variable __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data interactions. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves to specify the package version and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical version declaration in Python packages.",
