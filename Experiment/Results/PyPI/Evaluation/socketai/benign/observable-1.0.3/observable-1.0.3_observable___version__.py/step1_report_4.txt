  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple static assignment of version string",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable. There are no inputs, no outputs, no external data handling, and no complex logic. It is a straightforward declaration of package versioning. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code's minimal nature and lack of external interactions suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a version number declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
