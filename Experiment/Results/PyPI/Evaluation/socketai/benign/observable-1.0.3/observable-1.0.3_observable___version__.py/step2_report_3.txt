  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code elements are present.\n   - The code is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No need for adjustments.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all analyses indicate no malicious or suspicious behavior, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n**Overall Summary & Personal Estimate**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification**:\nThe code is a minimal, static version declaration with no external dependencies, inputs, or suspicious patterns. The scores reflect this benign nature accurately.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are correct. No changes needed. The code is entirely benign, with zero risk, malware, or obfuscation.",
