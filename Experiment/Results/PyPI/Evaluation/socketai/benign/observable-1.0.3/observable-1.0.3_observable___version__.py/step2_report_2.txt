  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a static string `\"1.0.3\"` to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors involved.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common Python packaging practices.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report identifies any suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, external calls, or data flows that could be exploited.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Score Justification and Recommendations:**\n   - The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all correctly assigned as 0.\n   - The risk scores are also correctly low, given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, there is no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious behavior beyond the code's actual content, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**My personal estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments.",
