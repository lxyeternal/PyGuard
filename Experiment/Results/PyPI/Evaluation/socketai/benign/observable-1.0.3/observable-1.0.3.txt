      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard packaging utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The primary concerns relate to best practices in executing shell commands and reading version info, but these do not constitute malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard event handling implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main security risk stems from executing untrusted handlers, which is inherent to such systems. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent risk of executing untrusted code."

      "conclusion": "The assessments are generally accurate and consistent with the evidence. Report 4's suspicion of malicious activity is well-supported, warranting higher scores. Reports lacking code appropriately have low scores. Slight confidence adjustments for incomplete reports improve alignment. No major issues found; current scores are justified."
