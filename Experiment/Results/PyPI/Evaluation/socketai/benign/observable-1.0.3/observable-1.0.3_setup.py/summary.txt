  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard packaging utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The primary concerns relate to best practices in executing shell commands and reading version info, but these do not constitute malicious behavior."
