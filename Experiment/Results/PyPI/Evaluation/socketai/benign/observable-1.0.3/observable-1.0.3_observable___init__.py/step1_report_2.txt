  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network transmission, or file writes present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes or objects from a local 'core' module and defines the public API. There are no external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a clean and standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious module setup for an event system. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code is benign and appears to serve a legitimate purpose.",
