{
  "purpose": "Define and export an event system module for Python, exposing Observable, EventNotFound, and HandlerNotFound classes or objects.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.core' to load core components of the event system.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import from '.core' module; no data flows or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; the code is straightforward and adheres to common module pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module defining an event system interface. It imports core classes or functions from a local module '.core' and exposes them via __all__. There are no dynamic code execution, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup for an event system with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
