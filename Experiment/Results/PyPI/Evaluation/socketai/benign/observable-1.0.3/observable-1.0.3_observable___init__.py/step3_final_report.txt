  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports core classes and exceptions from a local '.core' module and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.core' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export only",
  "flows": "N/A - static import/export, no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module, likely an __init__.py, importing classes and exceptions from a local module and exposing them via __all__. It contains no runtime data handling, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and should be maintained.",
