  "purpose": "Defines an event system module by exporting core classes and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.core' which contains core functionality.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; module simply re-exports classes and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports core classes and exceptions related to an event system and exposes them via __all__. It contains a file encoding declaration and a module-level docstring. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behavior. The import and export statements are standard for module packaging. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for an event system with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
