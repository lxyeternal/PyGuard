  "purpose": "Define a custom listener class for handling session messages and errors in ncclient transport.",
  "sources": "Import of SessionListener from ncclient.transport, and class methods that print received messages and errors.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statements) in callback and errback methods.",
  "flows": "Messages received in callback() flow to print(), errors in errback() flow to print().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward logging actions without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of SessionListener with two methods: callback() for printing received messages, and errback() for printing errors. Both methods simply output data to stdout using print(). No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling beyond standard output. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The import is from a well-known library, and the functions are typical for logging or debugging purposes. No obfuscated code, secret handling, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, straightforward implementation of a logging listener for network session messages and errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
