{
  "purpose": "Define a listener class for handling session messages and errors in a network communication context.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'root' and 'raw' parameters passed to callback and errback methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via print statements, which do not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "Data received in callback ('root', 'raw') is printed directly; errors in errback are printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of print statements for output is standard debugging or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple listener class inheriting from a session listener. It handles received messages and errors by printing them. No data manipulation, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present. The print statements are safe, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a session listener with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
