{
  "purpose": "Logging received network messages and errors for debugging or monitoring purposes within a network session.",
  "sources": "The callback method receives 'root' (likely parsed XML data) and 'raw' (raw message data). The errback method receives 'err' (error object).",
  "sinks": "The print statements output 'root' attributes, tags, raw message data, and error information to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input data from network messages flows into callback and errback methods, which then output to stdout via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, inheriting from a known library class, with simple print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of SessionListener with overridden methods to print received messages and errors. It does not process, store, or transmit data beyond printing. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The printing of raw network data could be a minor security concern if logs are exposed, but this is typical for debugging. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified based on the benign, debugging nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward network message and error logger with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; only a minimal risk consideration exists if logs are exposed, but overall, it is safe.",
