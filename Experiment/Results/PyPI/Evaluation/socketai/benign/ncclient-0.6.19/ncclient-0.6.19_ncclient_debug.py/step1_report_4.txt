{
  "purpose": "Define a custom listener class for ncclient's SessionListener that prints received messages and errors.",
  "sources": "The callback and errback methods output data received from the network or session.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output data directly to the console, which is a sink for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data from network -> callback/errback methods -> print statements -> console output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward logging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a session listener class and defines a subclass that overrides callback and errback methods to print received messages and errors. The callback method formats and outputs the received message root and raw data, while errback outputs error details. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code simply logs network messages and errors for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a network message listener intended for logging purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
