{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom listener class for handling session events in the ncclient library, specifically for printing received messages and errors during NETCONF communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the callback and errback methods, which are invoked with network message data and error objects.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output raw message data and error information to the console or logs.",
  "flows": "Input from network events triggers callback and errback methods, which then pass data to print functions for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a network transport library and extends it with a subclass that overrides callback and errback methods. These methods print received messages and errors. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The printing of raw network messages could be a debug feature, but it does not pose security risks by itself. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a network message listener intended for logging or debugging. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
