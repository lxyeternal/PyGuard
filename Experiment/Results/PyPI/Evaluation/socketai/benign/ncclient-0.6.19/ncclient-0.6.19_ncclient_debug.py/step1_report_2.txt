{
  "purpose": "Define a listener class that outputs received messages and errors from a network session",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the callback parameters 'root' and 'raw', as well as 'err' in errback",
  "sinks": "The print statements output data to the console; no data is sent elsewhere or stored",
  "flows": "Input from 'callback' and 'errback' methods are printed directly, no further processing or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of SessionListener with two methods: 'callback' prints received messages with their root tag, attributes, and raw data; 'errback' prints errors. No untrusted input handling beyond printing, no external communication, no data leakage or malicious actions observed. The code relies on external 'ncclient' library components and only outputs to stdout.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple logging utility for network session messages and errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
