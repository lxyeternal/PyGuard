{
  "purpose": "A custom logging adapter that appends session-related information to log messages.",
  "sources": "self.extra['session'], session attributes (host, id), id(session)",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies log record 'extra' data, but does not write to external systems or outputs untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input session object -> process() method -> constructs prefix -> updates log record 'extra' -> logs message with session info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. The code simply manipulates logging data. No hidden backdoors or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LoggerAdapter subclass intended to enhance log messages with session info. It checks for 'session' in 'extra', constructs a prefix with session attributes, and updates the log record's 'extra' data. The code operates solely within logging logic and does not perform network operations, file access, or any malicious activity. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign logging utility designed to include session information in logs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely within the context of logging.",
