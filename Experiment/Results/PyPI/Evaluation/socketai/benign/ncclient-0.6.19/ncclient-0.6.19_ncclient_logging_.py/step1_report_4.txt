{
  "purpose": "To create a custom logging adapter that appends session information (such as host and session id) to log messages for better traceability.",
  "sources": "The 'session' object in self.extra, which may contain 'host' and 'id' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Formatted log message output that includes session details; no direct data leakage or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves session attributes from self.extra, formats them, and injects this info into log messages.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any unusual actions, nor does it contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. It simply enhances logging with session data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LoggerAdapter subclass that adds session-related context to log messages. It checks for the presence of 'session' in self.extra, and if available, constructs a prefix with host and session id. It then updates the 'extra' dictionary in kwargs to include session info before formatting the message. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no external network activity, and no code that could be used for malicious purposes are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a logging utility to include session context in logs. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, purpose-driven code snippet with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
