  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logging adapter to automatically add session information to log messages for better traceability.",
  "sources": "The session object passed via self.extra containing session or session-related attributes.",
  "sinks": "The formatted log message which includes session details, potentially used for audit or troubleshooting.",
  "flows": "Input: self.extra['session'] -> Processing attributes (host, id) -> Formatting the message -> Passing extra data to the log record.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. The code merely appends session info to logs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a session object in self.extra. It constructs a prefix string with session details, including host and session id or object id. It then ensures that the extra data is passed along with the log message. No external data sources, network connections, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a logging adapter, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging utility for adding session details to logs. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
