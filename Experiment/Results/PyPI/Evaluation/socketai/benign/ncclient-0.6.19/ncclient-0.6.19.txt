      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The primary risk stems from dynamic import based on untrusted input and socket exposure, which can be mitigated with proper input validation and network controls. Scores are Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3, reflecting moderate concern without active malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured XML utility module used in network management contexts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary security concern relates to processing untrusted XML inputs, especially with XSLT transformations, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, as provided, the code itself is safe and aligns with the reported scores."
