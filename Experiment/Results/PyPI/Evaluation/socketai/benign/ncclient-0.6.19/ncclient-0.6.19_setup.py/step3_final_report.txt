  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'ncclient' Python package, performing dependency parsing, reading README, and executing package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'requirements-test.txt', and 'README.rst' files; environment version info check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and version check are benign.",
  "flows": "File reads and environment check without dynamic or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It reads static files, performs a standard Python version check, and calls setup() with package metadata. All signals are consistent with benign, well-structured code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The minimal risk score (around 0.1) in some reports is justified but could be zero, as static file reads are inherently safe unless files are compromised. The malware score is correctly 0, and obfuscation is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
