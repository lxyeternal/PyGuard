  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard URI parsing and capability management.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Reads capability URIs, no dangerous sinks.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: The code performs URI parsing, logging errors for invalid parameters, no malicious behaviors detected.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning appears sound. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score is justified given the lack of external effects.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, handling NETCONF capabilities.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or dangerous operations.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward URI parsing and data management.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard utility.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Managing capability URIs, parsing parameters.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Internal data processing, no external data transmission.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic.\n- Analysis: Standard URI parsing, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward implementation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No vulnerabilities or malware indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar capability management.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or dangerous operations.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Proper parsing, no malicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is reasonable. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: URI handling for NETCONF capabilities.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or malicious operations.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard parsing and management.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate utility, no risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is purely for URI parsing and capability management with no malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low scores (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the potential for malformed input, but no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The code is a standard URI parser and capability manager for NETCONF, with no evident security issues.\n- The low risk scores are justified.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis is a safe, standard utility code with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
