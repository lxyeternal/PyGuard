  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing NETCONF capability URIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified, primarily reflecting minimal risk from input validation errors. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code's clarity and functionality."
