{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions to handle NETCONF capabilities by parsing and managing capability URIs.",
  "sources": "Reads capability URIs from input parameters in class methods (e.g., 'add', 'from_uri').",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or execution outside the controlled environment.",
  "flows": "Capability URIs are added via 'add' or initialized in constructor; 'from_uri' parses these URIs into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code primarily processes URI strings and logs errors for invalid parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URI parsing, capability management, and logging. It does not include network calls, system commands, or data exfiltration. The use of string splitting and URI processing is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious logic identified. The 'logger.error' usage for invalid parameters is normal for debugging. No signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing NETCONF capability URIs with no malicious or suspicious activity. It is well-structured for its purpose without security risks or malware indications.",
