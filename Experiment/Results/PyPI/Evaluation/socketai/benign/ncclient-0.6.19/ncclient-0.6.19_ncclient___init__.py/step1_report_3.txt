{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version constant, checks Python version compatibility, and declares a custom exception class for an NCClient module.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, _version.get_versions()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard version check and class declaration",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version compatibility check, raises an error if Python version is below 3.5, defines a custom exception, and updates version info from an imported module. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard library and import statements are typical. No external data input, no suspicious code execution, and no suspicious network or system actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a legitimate module setup with version handling and custom error definition.",
