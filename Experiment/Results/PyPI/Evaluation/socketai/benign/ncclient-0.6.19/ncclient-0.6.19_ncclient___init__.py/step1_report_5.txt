{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up versioning and compatibility checks for a Python package, defining an error class for client errors.",
  "sources": "sys module for Python version info; _version module for dynamic version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow or output actions related to untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; the code mainly performs version checks and imports.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check to enforce minimum Python 3.5, defines a custom exception, and dynamically sets the version string from an imported module. All operations are standard for a package's initial setup. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The only external interaction is an import of a local module '_version' to retrieve version info, which is typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward initialization segment for a Python package, focused on version compatibility and error class definition. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe.",
