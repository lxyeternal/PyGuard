{
  "purpose": "The code sets up versioning and error handling for a Python module, enforcing a minimum Python version requirement.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check, import statements for internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static checks and imports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is straightforward, with version enforcement and exception class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license information and versioning details. It enforces a minimum Python version (3.5+) by raising a RuntimeError if the condition is not met. It defines a custom exception class 'NCClientError'. It imports an internal module '_version' and dynamically updates the __version__ attribute using this module's get_versions() method. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or hardcoded secrets. The structure and content are typical for a well-structured Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup script with version enforcement and custom error class definition. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
