{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information, imports system modules, checks Python version compatibility, and defines a custom exception class.",
  "sources": "sys module (for version info), local module _version (for version data)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations detected",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; version check is a static operation, and exception class is a simple class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; version info is fetched from a local module, but this is common practice",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check to ensure compatibility, defines a custom exception, and updates version info from a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The version check enforces environment constraints, and the exception class is standard. The local import of '_version' is typical in package version management, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with version handling and error class definition. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
