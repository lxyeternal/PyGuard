{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, enforcing a minimum Python version, defining a custom exception, and setting version info dynamically from a local module.",
  "sources": "sys module for version check, local _version module for version info",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Static checks; no runtime data flow involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version enforcement and class definition",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard environment check, defines a custom exception class, and dynamically assigns version info from a local module. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The import of '_version' is typical for version management. The version check ensures compatibility, and the code is static and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe package initialization routine.",
