  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code performs a standard setup routine: defining version info, checking Python version compatibility, defining a custom exception, and importing a local '_version' module to set the version string dynamically.\n- None of the reports detect any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- The code appears to be typical for a Python package's initialization module, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Confirmations and observations:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, such as code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n- The import of `_version` is a common pattern for version management within a package.\n- The version check enforces a minimum Python version (3.5+), which is standard practice.\n- The custom exception class is straightforward and unremarkable.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n\n- The only minor point is the import of `_version`, which is a local module. While this is common, it relies on the integrity of that module. However, no evidence suggests malicious intent or tampering.\n- The code is static and straightforward; no dynamic or obfuscated code is present.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the absence of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Note:** If future versions of this package include dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors, re-evaluation would be necessary. For now, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
