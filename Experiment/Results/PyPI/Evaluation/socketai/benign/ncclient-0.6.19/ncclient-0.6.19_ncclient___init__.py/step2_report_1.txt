  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Version info, sys module, exception class.\n- Sources: sys module, local _version.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow, static checks.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis: Standard version check, exception class, version info from local module. No malicious or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (initially 0, but given the importance of version checks, a slight risk could be considered, but given the absence of actual malicious behavior, 0 is appropriate).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard package initialization.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: version check, custom exception, version info from local module.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard setup: version enforcement, exception class, dynamic version.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others: version check, exception class, local version info.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and matches the descriptions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** The only potential concern is the version check, which is standard and safe.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 or very close to zero.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is typical package initialization code with version enforcement.\n- The import of a local `_version` module is common in version management.\n- No suspicious patterns, no malicious payloads, no obfuscation, no external data handling.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears benign, standard, and safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
