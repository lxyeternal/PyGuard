{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python module with versioning and compatibility checks, defining a custom exception class.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the 'sys' module, used to check Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to potential data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code performs a version check and imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed. The code performs standard version validation and module import.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing comments, then sets a version tuple. It imports 'sys' to verify Python version compatibility, raising an error if the environment is below Python 3.5. It defines a custom exception class, NCClientError. Then, it imports a local '_version' module to set the '__version__' dynamically. All actions are typical setup routines for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with version checks and exception class definition. It contains no malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
