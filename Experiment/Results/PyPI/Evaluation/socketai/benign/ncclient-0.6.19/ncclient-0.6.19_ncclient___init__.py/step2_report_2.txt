  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python module setup: license info, version info, Python version check, custom exception class, and dynamic version assignment.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- The only external dependency is the local '_version' module, which is common in version management.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior; straightforward version check and exception class.\n- **Analysis:** Correct. The code is standard, and no suspicious activity is present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup with no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate. No anomalies or malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Same as above; no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Confirmed. The code performs environment checks and class definitions without any malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Standard module initialization, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correct. The code enforces version constraints and defines an exception class without any suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Same as above; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Confirmed. The code is typical for package setup.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious or suspicious code. All point out standard practices.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that are not supported by the code; all claims are reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured module setup with version checks and a custom exception class. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable. I would maintain the same scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
