  "purpose": "The code is intended to provide version information by parsing a predefined JSON string.",
  "sources": "The JSON string 'version_json' containing version metadata.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function which parses the version information.",
  "flows": "The 'version_json' string is parsed by json.loads() in get_versions().",
  "anomalies": "The JSON data contains a future date (2025-03-02), which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The comment indicates this is auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a static JSON string containing version metadata such as date, revision ID, and version number. The JSON appears to be generated by versioneer.py, a common version management tool. No external input is read, and no suspicious or malicious operations are present. The code is simple, clean, and intended solely for version retrieval. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for version reporting. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
