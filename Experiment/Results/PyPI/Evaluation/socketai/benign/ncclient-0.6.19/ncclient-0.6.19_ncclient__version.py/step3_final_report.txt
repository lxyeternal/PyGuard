{
  "purpose": "Provides version metadata by parsing a static JSON string generated by 'versioneer.py'.",
  "sources": "Reads a hardcoded JSON string assigned to 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output that could leak data.",
  "flows": "The function 'get_versions()' loads and returns the parsed JSON data from the static string.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a future date ('2025-03-02') in the JSON, which is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static JSON loader, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The JSON data is static and generated by a versioning tool. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The future date is an anomaly but not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assessments and scores are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and security profile of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
