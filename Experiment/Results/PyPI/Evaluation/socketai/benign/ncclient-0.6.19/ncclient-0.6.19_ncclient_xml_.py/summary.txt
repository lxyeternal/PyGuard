  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured XML utility module used in network management contexts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary security concern relates to processing untrusted XML inputs, especially with XSLT transformations, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, as provided, the code itself is safe and aligns with the reported scores."
