{
  "purpose": "The code builds protobuf files using grpc_tools.protoc, likely for generating Python gRPC code from .proto files.",
  "sources": "The function build_protobufs reads the root_proto_dir argument to locate the .proto file; os.path.join constructs the path to saleae.proto.",
  "sinks": "The grpc_tools.protoc.main() executes the protoc command, which compiles proto files; this is standard and not inherently risky.",
  "flows": "Input from root_proto_dir leads to path construction, which then triggers protoc compilation via grpc_tools.protoc.main().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The import of grpc_tools and dynamic compilation are normal for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to compile protobuf files using grpc_tools.protoc, passing directory paths and proto files as arguments. It outputs compilation logs and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. The __main__ block triggers compilation from a relative directory, and a class is defined for a build hook that also calls this function. The code appears to be a straightforward build utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protobuf build script with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It functions solely to compile proto files for gRPC use. No malware or security threats are present.",
