  "purpose": "This script builds Python protobuf files from a specified directory of proto files using grpc_tools.protoc.",
  "sources": "The root_proto_dir parameter, os.path.join call, and the import of grpc_tools.protoc.",
  "sinks": "The grpc_tools.protoc.main() function call, which executes the command with provided arguments.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'root_proto_dir' flows into the os.path.join function and into grpc_tools.protoc arguments, then executes protoc command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of import inside function is unusual but not malicious. The code dynamically constructs and executes a command for protobuf compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to build protobuf files using grpc_tools.protoc, taking a directory path as input. It logs a message and constructs arguments for protoc, then executes protoc.main() to generate Python and gRPC Python code. The script also has a conditional to run this function if executed directly, and a hook class for integration with a build system, which calls the build function with a relative path. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dynamic execution of protoc is standard for protobuf code generation. No obfuscation or malicious anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward protobuf build script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard code generation task without suspicious behavior.",
