  "purpose": "Builds Protocol Buffer (protobuf) files using grpc_tools.protoc for a specified directory.",
  "sources": "The function build_protobufs reads the root_proto_dir parameter and imports grpc_tools.protoc and os.path.",
  "sinks": "The code executes grpc_tools.protoc.main() with arguments that include the path to a specific protobuf file.",
  "flows": "Input parameter root_proto_dir -> args array (with file path) -> grpc_tools.protoc.main() execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically builds protobuf files from specified directories. It imports necessary modules, constructs argument lists, and calls the protobuf compiler. The code appears straightforward and designed for code generation. The use of os.path.join and command-line argument construction seems standard. The only potential concern might be if the input directory is manipulated externally, but in this context, it is a local directory parameter. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious data flow is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protobuf build script with no evidence of malicious behavior. It performs code generation tasks and includes a build hook for integration. No malware or security risks are detected.",
