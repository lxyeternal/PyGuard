{
  "purpose": "Builds protobuf files using grpc_tools.protoc from a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reads the root_proto_dir parameter to locate the .proto file; invokes grpc_tools.protoc.main() with constructed arguments.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of grpc_tools.protoc.main() executes the protobuf compiler; no untrusted data flows into malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input directory path (root_proto_dir) flows into the argument list for protoc; protoc.main() executes the compilation process.",
  "anomalies": "Import of grpc_tools.protoc inside the function is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf build utility that constructs command-line arguments and calls the protobuf compiler. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The import inside the function is a stylistic choice, not a security concern. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard protobuf compilation task without malicious intent or security issues. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
