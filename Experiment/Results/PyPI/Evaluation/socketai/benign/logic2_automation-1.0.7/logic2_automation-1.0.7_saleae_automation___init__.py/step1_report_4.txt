  "anomalies": "Use of broad Exception in import handling; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific gRPC modules. If an exception occurs, it writes a detailed error message to stderr advising on potential causes and solutions, then re-raises the exception. The subsequent imports are local project modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The import error handling is broad but not malicious, merely user guidance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard import handling with user guidance on resolving import errors. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
