  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches exactly the provided snippet.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** No flaws; straightforward import with exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0. The low security risk aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches; no anomalies.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly identifies benign error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Properly interprets the import error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with the code.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Recognizes the broad exception handling and user guidance.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly interprets the import and error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; should be 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The code's primary function is to handle module imports and guide the user if dependencies are missing or incompatible. While the exception handling is broad, it does not introduce security risks. A small risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to potential for user confusion if error messages leak system info or if the exception handling is misused, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and the benign nature of the code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard import and error handling routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable.",
