  "purpose": "Handle import of gRPC modules with error guidance, and import local modules for package functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'saleae.grpc' modules and local modules (.manager, .capture, .errors).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flow or external data leaks; standard import operations.",
  "flows": "Import of modules; exception handling triggers user guidance message if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except Exception' is noted but common in import error handling; no malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports with a try-except block to catch import errors, providing user guidance for regeneration of protobuf files. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The exception handling is broad but standard for such scenarios. Local module imports are unconditional and typical for package setup. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import routine with helpful error messaging. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
