  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code's import and error handling are straightforward; no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or data leaks. The minimal security risk reflects the potential for error messages to leak environment info, but this is standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard import with guidance message.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just helpful error messaging.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** Same reasoning; guidance message does not imply malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard import error handling.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious code; the broad exception handling is typical but not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The guidance message is helpful, not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code snippet.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** The minimal security risk (0.1) across reports seems appropriate given the context. The only minor concern is the broad exception handling, which could mask other import issues, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and readable.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to broad exception handling, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes to scores are necessary. The code is a typical import routine with helpful error messaging, presenting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.  \n- The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.  \n- I recommend maintaining the current scores.",
