  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious API wrapper for Saleae Logic 2 software. It performs standard operations such as starting/stopping captures, managing analyzers, and exporting data, all through API requests. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (0.2) are justified and appropriate."
