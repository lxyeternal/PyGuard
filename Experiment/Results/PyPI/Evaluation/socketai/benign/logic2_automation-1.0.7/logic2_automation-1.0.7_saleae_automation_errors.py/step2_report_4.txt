  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, potential issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes, error handling functions, and mappings for gRPC errors from Saleae Logic 2. No malicious or suspicious code is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default for low severity)\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The error handling is standard, and the logic is clear.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard error parsing and exception raising. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is standard error handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard custom exception classes and error mapping, with regex parsing of error messages. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—error classes, message parsing, exception mapping, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly higher (0.1) but still low, reflecting minimal concern about potential vulnerabilities. The malware score remains zero, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard error handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score reflects minimal concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are at 0.5 or 0.1, reflecting very low security risk, which aligns with the straightforward error handling code.\n\n**My independent estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.5 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**No further action needed.**",
