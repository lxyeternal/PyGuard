  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code defines custom exceptions and error handling for gRPC errors from Saleae Logic 2. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. Security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. The code is standard error handling with no evident security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of error parsing and exception mapping.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. No suspicious logic or external activity is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is sound; the code is a typical error handler without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes straightforward exception classes and error message parsing.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0; no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with proper error handling structure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of regex and mapping of gRPC errors to exceptions, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The security risk is noted as 0.1, which is minimal and likely reflects the minor potential for misinterpretation but not actual maliciousness.\n- **Conclusion:** The code remains a standard error handling module; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous analyses, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, matching the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and purpose-driven.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely for error handling.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor point is the regex parsing of error messages, but it is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (the code is purely for error handling, with no security risks)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a well-structured, standard error handling module for gRPC communication with Saleae Logic 2. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent with the actual content.",
