{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling Saleae Logic 2 software errors and convert gRPC errors into these exceptions.",
  "sources": "Error messages received from gRPC calls (exc: grpc.RpcError) and regex matching of error message strings.",
  "sinks": "Raising specific exception instances based on error code or message, which could affect program flow or logging.",
  "flows": "grpc_error_to_exception() receives a grpc.RpcError, matches its code or message, and returns or raises a corresponding custom exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. Use of regex for parsing error messages is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for various error conditions related to Saleae Logic 2 software, with a focus on gRPC error handling. It uses a regex to parse error messages for codes and maps these to exception classes. The functions convert gRPC errors into meaningful exceptions for better error management. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling module with no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward error handling implementation for Saleae Logic 2 API errors. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. The code correctly maps gRPC errors to custom exceptions to improve error diagnostics. Overall, it is a benign and standard error processing module.",
