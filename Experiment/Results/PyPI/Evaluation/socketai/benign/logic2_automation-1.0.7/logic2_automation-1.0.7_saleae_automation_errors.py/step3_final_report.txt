{
  "purpose": "This code defines exception classes, error handling functions, and mappings for Saleae Logic 2 gRPC errors. It processes error messages, converts them into exceptions, and raises them accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads error messages from grpc.RpcError details and error codes from saleae_pb2 ERROR_CODE enums.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it only parses error messages and maps error codes to exceptions.",
  "flows": "Error messages from grpc.RpcError are matched with regex to extract error code and message, then mapped to exception classes, which are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard regex parsing and exception handling are used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to handle gRPC errors by mapping error codes to specific exceptions and parsing error messages. It does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data manipulation beyond error parsing. The regex is straightforward, matching a numeric code and message. No obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) reflects the slight potential concern about parsing untrusted input, but given the code's simplicity, this is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign error handling module for gRPC errors related to Saleae Logic 2. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use.",
