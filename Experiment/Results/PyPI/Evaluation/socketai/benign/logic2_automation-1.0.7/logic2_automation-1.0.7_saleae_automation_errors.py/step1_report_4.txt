{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exceptions, error handling, and conversion functions for handling gRPC errors related to Saleae Logic 2 software interactions.",
  "sources": "Error messages from gRPC responses, specifically from the exc.details() method and error code constants.",
  "sinks": "Exception objects created from error messages, which could potentially be raised to the caller and influence program flow.",
  "flows": "gRPC error responses → grpc_error_to_exception() → grpc_error_msg_to_exception() → exception instances based on error code or message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse error messages; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; error handling appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily maps gRPC error codes and messages to custom exception classes. It uses regex for parsing error message strings to extract codes and descriptions. Error handling is implemented to translate RPC errors into specific Python exceptions, which are then raised as needed. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The exception classes are standard and only serve to categorize errors. No malicious or sabotage-related code is detected; the code’s structure and logic are typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured error handling and exception mapping module for gRPC interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The implementation focuses on converting and raising exceptions based on gRPC error details without suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
