{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes, error handling functions, and mappings for handling errors from gRPC communication with Saleae Logic 2 software.",
  "sources": "Error message received from gRPC calls, specifically through grpc.RpcError exceptions and their details.",
  "sinks": "Exception creation and raising based on error messages, primarily for error handling flow control.",
  "flows": "gRPC RpcError occurs -> grpc_error_to_exception processes the error -> error message matched and converted to exception -> exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The regex and exception handling appear standard. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. No network or system manipulation code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on error handling and exception mapping for gRPC communication errors from Saleae Logic 2 software. It includes custom exception classes for various known error conditions, a context manager for handling gRPC exceptions, and functions for converting gRPC errors into these exceptions based on error codes and messages. The error message pattern matches a numeric code followed by descriptive text, which is standard for error handling. The overall structure and logic are typical for robust error processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code does not perform any data leaks, external network requests, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward error handling module for Saleae's gRPC API interactions. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. Its design is typical for error processing, and it maintains good separation of concerns without suspicious patterns.",
