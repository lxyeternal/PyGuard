{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and error handling functions for managing gRPC errors related to Saleae Logic 2 software interaction.",
  "sources": "Error messages from gRPC exceptions, error code mappings, regex pattern matching error message strings.",
  "sinks": "Exception objects instantiated from error messages, which could potentially be raised elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "grpc.RpcError exceptions are caught, their messages are parsed and mapped to specific exception classes, which are then raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of regex to parse error messages is standard, not malicious. No network or system modification commands present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements structured error handling for gRPC communication, including custom exceptions for various error scenarios. The use of regex for parsing error messages is typical. Error codes are mapped to exception classes, and detailed error messages are encapsulated within exception instances. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code performs straightforward exception handling and message parsing, with no external data exfiltration, system modification, or other malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign error handling module for gRPC interactions with Saleae Logic 2 software. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
