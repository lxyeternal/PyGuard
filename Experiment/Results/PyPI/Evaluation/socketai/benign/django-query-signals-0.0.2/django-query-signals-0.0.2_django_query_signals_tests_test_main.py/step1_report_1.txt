  "purpose": "Unit tests for Django signals related to User model operations, verifying that signals are triggered correctly.",
  "sources": "Import statements, decorators, and signal receiver functions within test methods, especially the User model and signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within receiver functions, calls to User ORM methods (bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, update).",
  "flows": "Signals are triggered on User ORM operations; receiver functions set flags when invoked, verifying signal firing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Signal handlers are simple assertions, standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django TestCase with multiple test methods, each registering signal receivers for specific User model operations. These receivers simply set flags upon invocation, which are then checked after performing the operations. No untrusted input is processed insecurely, and no external network or data leaks are present. The code's structure and use of signals are consistent with testing framework patterns. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite verifying Django signals for User model operations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for testing signal triggers.",
