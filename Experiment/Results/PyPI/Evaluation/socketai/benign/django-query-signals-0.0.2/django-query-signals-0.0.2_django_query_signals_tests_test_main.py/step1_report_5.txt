  "purpose": "Unit tests for Django signals related to user model operations, verifying signal triggering for bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, and update.",
  "sources": "Django ORM methods (bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, update) and signal receivers defined within the test methods.",
  "sinks": "Signal receiver callbacks that modify the 'tmp' dictionary upon signal receipt; no direct sinks of untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "ORM methods trigger signals; signal handlers update 'tmp' flags to confirm signal firing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-test signal handlers that modify shared state; no hardcoded credentials or external data leaks. No suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of Django test cases that verify whether specific signals are emitted during various ORM operations. It dynamically registers signal handlers within each test to modify flags upon signal receipt. These handlers perform standard assertions and update local variables, with no external side effects, external data access, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward unit testing logic without obfuscation or malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external communication are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard Django unit tests for signal triggering. There are no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be legitimate test code verifying framework behavior, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
