  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Django test for signals related to User model.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signal handlers set flags; no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Valid, safe, and typical testing code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, verifying signals on User model operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, benign signal testing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—testing Django signals on User model.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward test code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing signals with User model operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical signal verification code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—unit tests for signals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard testing logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and typical.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard Django test modules that verify signal firing during CRUD operations on the User model.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern is a low securityRisk score (~0.1), which is justified by the fact that these are test codes and do not handle sensitive data or external communications.\n- **Malware Score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** High (mostly 0.95 to 1), as the analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the code's benign nature.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe, standard testing code for Django signals.\n- The risk scores are justified given the context—test code, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, justified by the nature of test code, no sensitive data involved)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard Django test suite for signal verification with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
