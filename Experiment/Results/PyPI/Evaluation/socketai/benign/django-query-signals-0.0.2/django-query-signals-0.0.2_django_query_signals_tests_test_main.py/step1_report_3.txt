  "purpose": "Unit tests for Django signals related to User model CRUD operations using django_query_signals",
  "sources": "Imports from django_test, django.contrib.auth.models, django_query_signals; User model; signals like pre_bulk_create, post_bulk_create, pre_delete, post_delete, etc.",
  "sinks": "Signal receiver functions that set flags; User model methods like bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, update",
  "flows": "Data flows from model operations (e.g., bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, update) to receiver functions which modify temporary flags",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Signal handlers are straightforward and only set flags based on expected signals.",
  "analysis": "The code implements test cases for Django signals, verifying that signal handlers are called during specific model operations. Signal handlers modify local flags; no external data or user input is involved. The test functions create or modify User instances and verify signal invocation. No code appears to perform data leakage, code injection, or malicious actions. No external network connections, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of signals and model methods is standard. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code; the code is typical test code for signal verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for Django signals related to the User model. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely verifies that signals fire during CRUD operations. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
