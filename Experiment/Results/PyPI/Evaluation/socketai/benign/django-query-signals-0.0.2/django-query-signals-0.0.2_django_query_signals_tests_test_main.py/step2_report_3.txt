  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and the reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a Django test suite verifying signals for User model operations.\n- No suspicious code, external network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- Signal handlers are simple, setting flags, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is standard for testing Django signals, with no obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code as testing signals on User model operations.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; safe and standard.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the test's aim.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 1, indicating high certainty.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, though the securityRisk could be slightly higher if considering the test context, but since it's a benign test, 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly notes the use of Django signals and User model.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately finds no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, with standard signal testing.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — suitable.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, straightforward testing code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Code presence of malware:** No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is purely for testing signals.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low securityRisk, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to being test code, no real risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Django test suite verifying signal emissions during User model operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.",
