{
  "purpose": "The code is a Django test suite verifying that signal handlers are correctly triggered during CRUD operations on the User model.",
  "sources": "Signal registration decorators (@receiver) and ORM methods (bulk_create, delete, get_or_create, update_or_create, update).",
  "sinks": "Flags set within signal handlers; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Signals are emitted during ORM operations; handlers set flags to confirm invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code registers signal handlers for various User model operations, performs ORM actions, and asserts that signals are triggered. The handlers only set boolean flags, and no external data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, which is purely for testing purposes. The high confidence scores (around 0.9-1) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django test suite verifying signal emissions during User model operations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
