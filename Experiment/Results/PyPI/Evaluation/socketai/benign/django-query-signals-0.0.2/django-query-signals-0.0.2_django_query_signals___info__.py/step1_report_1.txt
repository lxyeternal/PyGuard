  "purpose": "Define label metadata for a Django module related to query signals.",
  "sources": "None; the code only initializes a dictionary with static string values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, setting fixed string values without dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and static, creating a dictionary 'LABELS' with predefined string entries for 'class', 'name', and 'verbose_name'. It lacks input handling, external data, or complex logic. No suspicious behavior, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident. The purpose appears to be setting metadata for Django signal labels, aligning with typical Django conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward metadata initialization for a Django module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
