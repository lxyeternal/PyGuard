  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static data assignment occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and uses hardcoded string values without dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary LABELS with specific keys and string values related to Django signals.
