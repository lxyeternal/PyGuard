  "purpose": "Define static metadata for a Django module related to query signals.",
  "sources": "Static dictionary assignments within the module; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes a dictionary with fixed values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and follows standard Django configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dictionary 'LABELS' with static string key-value pairs for 'class', 'name', and 'verbose_name'. It contains no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious constructs. The comments indicate its role as a Django setup module, which is typical and benign. No obfuscation, data leakage, or suspicious activity is present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply zero security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. The code aligns with standard configuration practices and poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, static configuration snippet used in a Django project. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
