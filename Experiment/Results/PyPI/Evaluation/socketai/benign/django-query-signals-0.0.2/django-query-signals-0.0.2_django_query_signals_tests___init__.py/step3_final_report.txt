  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`sys`, `os`), reads environment variables, user input, uses eval()/exec(), contains obfuscated variable names, communicates externally.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution via eval()/exec(), environment variable access, potential network communication, file system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) flow into eval()/exec(), possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval()/exec(), reading from environment variables, signs of external communication, lack of clear logic in some snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets range from benign minimal imports and placeholders to highly suspicious scripts with obfuscation and dynamic execution. Reports 1-4 are consistent with benign or incomplete code, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external communication, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.8) scores. The assessments align with the described behaviors, and the scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Benign snippets are correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation risks. The suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution warrants high scores, indicating potential malicious intent. Overall, the reports are consistent and justified; no adjustments needed.",
