{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to configure and install the Python package 'django-query-signals' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata variables (name, description, version, author, URLs, requirements, etc.) to pass to the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the provided metadata; there are no direct sinks for untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Static metadata variables are assembled into a dictionary and passed directly to setup(), with no user input or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and typical of a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and configuration parameters statically and calls setup() with these parameters. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior are present. URLs are constructed using string concatenation but do not point to suspicious or unknown domains. The code is consistent with standard setup.py practices and contains no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup file is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply provides package metadata for installation.",
