{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'django-query-signals', used to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, description, version, author info, URLs, requirements) from predefined variables and functions such as find_packages().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is the main sink, which receives package metadata and requirements to generate a distributable package. No untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The data flows from predefined variables and function calls into the setup() function via the KWARGS dictionary, which then executes to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious URL manipulations are present. The URLs appear standard and static. The code is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and configuration parameters, then calls setup() to prepare the package. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected. The URLs are static and point to a repository, not suspicious domains. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks typical for distribution on PyPI or similar repositories.",
