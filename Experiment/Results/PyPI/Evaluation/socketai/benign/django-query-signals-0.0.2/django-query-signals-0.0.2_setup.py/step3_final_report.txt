{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a Django-related project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static variables containing package info, URL strings constructed via string concatenation, and function calls like find_packages().",
  "sinks": "Data flows into setup() with static strings; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Static variables and function outputs directly pass data into setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious URLs. URL construction is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, no user input, and no obfuscation are present. URLs are constructed from static strings, and the package dependencies are explicitly listed. The absence of any suspicious patterns or malicious behavior indicates a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals confirm its benign nature.",
