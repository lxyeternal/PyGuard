  "purpose": "This setup file configures the packaging for a Python project named 'django-query-signals'.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments and function calls (find_packages), with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function which processes the provided package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is static or derived from standard library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata, including name, description, version, author info, URLs, keywords, classifiers, and requirements. URLs are constructed via string concatenation but are static in this context. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is involved. The use of 'find_packages()' is standard for package discovery. The overall structure follows typical setup.py conventions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard and benign Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
