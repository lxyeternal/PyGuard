{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration script for packaging a Python project named 'django-query-signals'. Its purpose is to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of variables, import statements, string concatenation for URLs",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call with all package metadata and dependencies",
  "flows": "Variables such as URL_MAIN and URL_DOWNLOAD are constructed from static strings; these are passed directly into setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted input involved",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments observed. URLs are constructed from static strings, no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata and dependencies as static variables, constructs URLs via string concatenation from static parts, and calls setup() with these parameters. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or unusual activity. The URLs are not pointing to suspicious domains, and no sensitive data or environment variables are used. The code is straightforward, typical of a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner.",
