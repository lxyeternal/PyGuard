{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'django-query-signals' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package metadata, including name, description, version, author, email, URLs, keywords, classifiers, requirements, and license.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function from setuptools that processes the provided metadata and requirements for package installation.",
  "flows": "The code assigns metadata variables, constructs a dictionary 'KWARGS', and passes it to setup(), which processes package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns. URLs are constructed from constants but are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, constructs a dictionary with configuration parameters, and calls setup(). The URLs are built from string concatenation but do not contain any suspicious or malicious content. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply provides package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
