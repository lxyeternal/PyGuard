  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n1. **Code Content & Analysis:**\n   - All reports describe a file that contains only a docstring and a comment about project settings.\n   - There are no executable statements, data inputs/outputs, or any code logic.\n   - The code is purely documentation or configuration notes, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - Based on the provided code, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. The code is benign.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments; they correctly identify the code as non-executable and harmless.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The summaries and conclusions are aligned with the minimal content of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score should also be 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is correctly 0, given the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores and analysis are consistent across reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malware.\n- I would maintain the scores as they are: `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
