The minor security considerations relate to external signal handlers, not the code itself. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for external misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django configuration with insecure defaults and an external module invocation that could pose a security risk if the module is malicious. No direct malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of 'django_integrator'. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk is moderate (~0.6). It is recommended to verify and trust external modules before deployment and to address insecure defaults for production security."
