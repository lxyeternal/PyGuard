{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Django application configuration, setting labels and registering signals without performing any external data processing or network activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem path operations to determine module directory; module attribute assignments for labels; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data transmission or file writes; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "Filesystem path extraction -> label assignment -> class creation -> setting default app config; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Django setup with standard Python idioms; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Django app configuration tasks: importing modules, determining filesystem paths, dynamically creating a subclass of AppConfig, setting labels, and registering signals. It does not read external input, perform network operations, or manipulate data in a suspicious manner. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The logic is clear, and the code aligns with typical Django practices. The absence of external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
