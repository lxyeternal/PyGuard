  "purpose": "Initialize and configure a Django application by setting labels and connecting signals.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path using os.path functions; imports Django modules and project-specific modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or sends untrusted data; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Path and label setup flow from reading __file__ to setting class attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up application labels and class configurations for a Django app. It manipulates module and class attributes to register the app. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks present. Imports are standard, and the logic is straightforward for Django app initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django application setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any unsafe operations or contain suspicious code patterns.",
