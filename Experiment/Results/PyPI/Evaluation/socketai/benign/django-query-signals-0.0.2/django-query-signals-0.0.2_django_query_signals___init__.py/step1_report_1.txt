  "purpose": "Initialize a Django application configuration and connect signals for model lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.path functions), importing modules, accessing __info__ and signals.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external input to sensitive operations; code mainly defines a class and sets app configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code structures, and no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django app configuration class, assigns labels, and connects signals related to model events. It performs environment path calculations and dynamically creates a class with no external input or malicious behavior. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django application configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
