  "purpose": "Initialize a Django application configuration, setting metadata and connecting signals.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.split, the imported signals module, and the __info__ module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code computes a directory path and assigns class and app configuration attributes, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code primarily sets up Django app configuration and signals.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and Django components, calculates the app's directory path, assigns labels and class types dynamically, and sets default app config. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration is present. The code appears to be standard Django app setup code, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django app initialization module that configures application labels and signals without any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
