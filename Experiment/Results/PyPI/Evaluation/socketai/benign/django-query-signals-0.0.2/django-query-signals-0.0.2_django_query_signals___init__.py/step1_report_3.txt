{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Django application configuration and sets up signal handlers.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (__file__), imports configuration info (__info__), and accesses signal objects from .signals.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file write, or exec calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from filesystem path resolution to dynamic class creation, using imported module info, without data passing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code appears to be standard Django app setup.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its directory, assigns a class dynamically to extend Django AppConfig, and registers this as the default app configuration. It relies solely on safe operations and imported module info. No external input influences its execution beyond standard imports, and no sensitive data is read or written. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code functions as a typical Django app initialization routine.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign Django app setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
