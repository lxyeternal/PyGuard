{
  "purpose": "This module adds custom signal handling around Django QuerySet methods for CRUD operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads method calls on QuerySet, accesses self.model for sender info, and interacts with Django signals.",
  "sinks": "Signals are sent with sender and args; method calls on QuerySet (e.g., bulk_create, get_or_create, update_or_create, delete, update).",
  "flows": "Wrapped QuerySet methods send signals before and after executing the original method, passing context data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The signal calls and method wrapping are standard Django patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines signals and wraps core QuerySet methods to emit signals before and after execution, facilitating event-driven extensions. It references QuerySet methods and sends signals with relevant data. No untrusted input sources or insecure operations are evident. The purpose appears to be standard instrumentation for model operations, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. There are no code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard signal wrapping for Django QuerySet methods to facilitate event handling, with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It appears to be a benign extension for Django models.",
