  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code adds signals around ORM methods.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external untrusted input sources are evident; signals are used for hooks.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is a standard pattern for adding signals.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate, as no vulnerabilities are detected.  \n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the extension of ORM with signals, with potential exposure via signals.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** External handlers could misuse signals, but the code itself is benign.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The signals could be misused externally, but the code itself is safe.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly elevated, perhaps due to the potential for external misuse.  \n    - This is acceptable, considering signals can be misused if external handlers are malicious, but the code itself is safe.  \n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score is slightly high but justifiable given the potential for external misuse. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the wrapping pattern.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that signals are dispatched with context, but no malicious behavior.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; this is a standard, safe pattern.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the wrapping of ORM methods with signals.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signals are dispatched with context; no external untrusted input handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The pattern is standard and safe.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, considering signals could be misused externally, but the code itself is safe.  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the signal wrapping pattern.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signals are sent with context; no untrusted input is processed directly.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign extension.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable, given the potential for external misuse via signals, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** All scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are correct; code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.2, 0.1), justified by the potential for external handlers to misuse signals, but the core code remains safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.  \n- The code itself does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The potential security risk is minimal, mainly related to external handlers that could be malicious if they choose to misuse signals, but this is outside the scope of the code's inherent security.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the external signal handlers could be malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No significant changes are necessary.",
