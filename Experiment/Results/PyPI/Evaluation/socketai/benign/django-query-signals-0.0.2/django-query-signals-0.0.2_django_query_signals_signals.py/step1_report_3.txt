{
  "purpose": "Define custom methods for Django QuerySet to include signals before and after core database operations, enhancing observability or extensibility.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded method names, class attributes, and signals; uses method references from Django QuerySet.",
  "sinks": "Calls to QuerySet methods like bulk_create, get_or_create, update_or_create, delete, update, which execute database operations.",
  "flows": "Custom wrapper functions send signals before and after calling the actual QuerySet methods, passing relevant context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic, and no unusual network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides standard Django QuerySet methods to insert signals for pre- and post-operation hooks. It uses a dictionary to map method names to QuerySet methods and wraps these calls with signal dispatches, passing contextual data. No untrusted input handling, external data processing, or malicious payloads are present. The use of signals is typical for Django applications and appears intended for logging, auditing, or extending behavior. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of Django ORM functionality, designed for signaling around database operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a typical pattern used in Django projects for extensibility without security risks.",
