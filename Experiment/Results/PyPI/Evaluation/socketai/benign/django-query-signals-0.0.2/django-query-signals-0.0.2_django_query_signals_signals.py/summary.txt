  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension pattern for Django ORM, adding signals for lifecycle events without introducing malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security considerations relate to external signal handlers, not the code itself. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for external misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities."
