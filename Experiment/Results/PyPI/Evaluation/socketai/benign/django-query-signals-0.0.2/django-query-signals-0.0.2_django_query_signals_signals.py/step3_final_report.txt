  "purpose": "This module extends Django ORM QuerySet methods by adding pre- and post-operation signals to facilitate observability and extensibility within Django applications.",
  "sources": "Method calls to QuerySet's bulk_create, get_or_create, update_or_create, delete, and update functions, as well as the injection points where these methods are wrapped.",
  "sinks": "Signals dispatched with method arguments and context, which could be received by external handlers; no direct untrusted data processing or external network activity present.",
  "flows": "Original ORM method invoked -> signals (pre and post) dispatched with relevant context -> original method returns result -> wrapped method returns result.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The pattern of replacing ORM methods with signal-emitting wrappers is unusual but standard for Django extensibility; no secrets or external data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines signal objects for various ORM lifecycle events and patches the QuerySet class by replacing its methods with wrappers that emit signals before and after the original method execution. The signals include method parameters, which could be accessed by external handlers, but this is typical in Django for extensibility. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The pattern is common for adding hooks, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The slight security risk scores assigned in reports (around 0.1-0.2) are justified by the potential for external handlers to misuse signals, but the core code remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension pattern for Django ORM, adding signals for lifecycle events without introducing malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security considerations relate to external signal handlers, not the code itself. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for external misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
