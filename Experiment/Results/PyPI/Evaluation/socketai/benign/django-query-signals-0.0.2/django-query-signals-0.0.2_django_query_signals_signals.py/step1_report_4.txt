  "purpose": "Define custom wrapper functions around Django QuerySet methods to emit signals before and after execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (QuerySet methods), method arguments (objects, defaults, kwargs), and model information for signaling.",
  "sinks": "Calls to QuerySet methods (bulk_create, get_or_create, update_or_create, delete, update), which could potentially manipulate data.",
  "flows": "Method wrappers send signals with relevant data, then call the original QuerySet methods with provided arguments, and then return the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data leakage, or malicious network activity observed. The code primarily adds signaling around database operations.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps standard Django ORM QuerySet methods to emit signals before and after execution, facilitating hooks or listeners for additional logic. It relies on standard Django features and does not process external input directly or execute untrusted code. No insecure practices or malicious behavior are apparent. The signaling mechanism itself does not pose security risks. The code structure is straightforward and intentionally designed for modularity and extendability without introducing risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements non-malicious, standard extension of Django ORM functionality for signaling purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The design is safe and intended for tracking database operations within an application.",
