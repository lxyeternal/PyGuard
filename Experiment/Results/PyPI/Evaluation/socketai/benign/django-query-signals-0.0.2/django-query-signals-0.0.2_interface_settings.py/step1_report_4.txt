  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration file",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded SECRET_KEY",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG mode enabled, no restrictions on ALLOWED_HOSTS, inclusion of potentially insecure settings like DEBUG and empty ALLOWED_HOSTS",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings file generated by startproject. It includes a hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which is insecure for production. DEBUG is set to True, exposing detailed error information, also unsafe for production. ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty, which could lead to misconfiguration. The database uses SQLite, which is not inherently malicious but less secure than production-grade databases. The import of 'django_integrator' and the addition of 'django_query_signals' application is unusual but not malicious—these could be legitimate third-party or custom modules. Overall, no malicious code or backdoors are present, but configuration choices are insecure if used in production.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings module with insecure configurations such as hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG enabled. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The inclusion of external applications does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution if these are unverified sources. Overall, the code itself appears benign but insecure for production deployment.",
