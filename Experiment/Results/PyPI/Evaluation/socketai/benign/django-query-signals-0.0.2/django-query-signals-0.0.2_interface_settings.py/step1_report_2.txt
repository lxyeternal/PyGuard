  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration for the 'interface' application, including database, middleware, installed apps, and security settings.",
  "sources": "import os, django_integrator",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or user input directly.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables (e.g., SECRET_KEY, DEBUG) are static and not influenced by external input; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded in plaintext, which is a security risk for production environments. DEBUG mode is enabled, which can expose sensitive information. The inclusion of 'django_integrator' and calling 'add_application' could be benign or malicious depending on its origin; no explicit malicious behavior detected from the code shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings file, mainly defining configuration parameters. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is risky but not inherently malicious. DEBUG is enabled, which is dangerous in production but not malicious per se. The import of 'django_integrator' and the call to 'add_application' may be normal or could potentially introduce malicious behavior if 'django_integrator' is compromised, but no malicious actions are visible here. No user input is processed, and no suspicious code patterns such as dynamic execution or network connections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django settings file with some insecure practices (hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True) that should be addressed in production. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware is present in this code segment.",
