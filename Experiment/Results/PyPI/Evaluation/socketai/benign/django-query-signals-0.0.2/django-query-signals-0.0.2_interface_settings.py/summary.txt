  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django configuration with insecure defaults and an external module invocation that could pose a security risk if the module is malicious. No direct malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of 'django_integrator'. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk is moderate (~0.6). It is recommended to verify and trust external modules before deployment and to address insecure defaults for production security."
