  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The original code is a standard Django WSGI configuration file.\n- All reports consistently describe it as typical, straightforward, and without suspicious or malicious elements.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are present.\n- The code simply sets an environment variable and initializes the WSGI application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign and standard. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as standard deployment code without malicious behavior.  \n  **No errors or flaws detected.**\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  - *Malware:* All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - *Obfuscated:* All assign 0, which is correct.\n  - *Security Risk:* Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is minimal and acceptable considering the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores; all are consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard Django WSGI setup, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No issues or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- Scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No need for adjustments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
