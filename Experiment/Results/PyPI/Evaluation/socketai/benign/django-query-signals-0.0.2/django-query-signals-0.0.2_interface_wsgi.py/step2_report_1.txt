  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard Django WSGI configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the original code snippet.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Also correctly states the code is standard Django deployment code, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Perfectly reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. The security risk score is slightly above zero, but since the code is standard, this seems marginal.\n- **Justification for SecurityRisk:** The score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which is acceptable for such a benign script.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Django WSGI setup, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, with SecurityRisk at 0, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, SecurityRisk = 0, which is suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the code as standard Django WSGI configuration.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **SecurityRisk scores:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), which is acceptable given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk.\n- The minimal security risk score in report 3 (0.1) is justified given the code's simplicity; no need to adjust.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature. No further adjustments needed.",
