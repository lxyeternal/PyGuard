  "purpose": "Standard Django WSGI configuration for deploying the application.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting for DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, import of get_wsgi_application, invocation of get_wsgi_application()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external communications; environment variable setting is standard and safe",
  "flows": "Setting environment variable -> initializing WSGI application",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Django WSGI setup. It imports necessary modules, sets an environment variable for Django settings, and initializes the WSGI application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code aligns with typical deployment practices and does not perform any external network activity or dynamic code execution. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django WSGI configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
