  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django modules, sets a default environment variable for the Django settings module, and initializes the WSGI application. All operations are typical for a Django deployment setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard WSGI configuration script for a Django project with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
