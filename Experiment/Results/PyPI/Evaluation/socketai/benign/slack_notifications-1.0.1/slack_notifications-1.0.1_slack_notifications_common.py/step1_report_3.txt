{
  "purpose": "Define a notification client for making authorized HTTP requests to a specified base URL, with error handling and utility classes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'base_url' and 'token' in NotificationClient constructor, method parameters in call_resource.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'token' to set Authorization header; makes network requests with 'requests' library; logs response content.",
  "flows": "Token is embedded in headers; call_resource constructs URL from base_url and resource.handle; makes HTTP request; logs response; raises exceptions based on response status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code detected; no suspicious network behavior or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for object conversion and custom exceptions, and a NotificationClient for making HTTP requests with authorization. The token is passed securely via constructor and used in headers. Network requests are straightforward, with proper error handling and logging. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of standard 'requests' library functions and typical class structures indicates normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement a standard API client for notifications, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. The code is well-structured and does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
