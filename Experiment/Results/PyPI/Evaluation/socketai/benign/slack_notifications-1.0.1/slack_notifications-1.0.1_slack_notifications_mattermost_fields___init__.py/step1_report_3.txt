{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'mrkdwn' symbol from the 'slack_notifications.mattermost.fields' module for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from slack_notifications.mattermost.fields import mrkdwn' indicates the code reads the 'mrkdwn' object from an external module.",
  "sinks": "The code exports 'mrkdwn' via '__all__', which affects module exports but does not itself act as a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'mrkdwn' object into the module and is then exposed publicly via '__all__'. There are no data transformations or external data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The import path appears legitimate and typical for a Python project.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a symbol from an external module and re-exports it. There are no input sources that could be untrusted, no sinks that process external data, and no flow manipulations. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions. Its structure is typical for a module that organizes exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as an export of a symbol from another module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard module file with no security concerns.",
