{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting the 'mrkdwn' symbol from the 'slack_notifications.mattermost.fields' module, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'mrkdwn' from an external module 'slack_notifications.mattermost.fields'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'mrkdwn' and expose it via __all__, with no data or input processing happening.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is minimal and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module re-export, importing 'mrkdwn' from a specified package and defining __all__ for export. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or external data flows. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is very basic and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply exposes an imported symbol for external use.",
