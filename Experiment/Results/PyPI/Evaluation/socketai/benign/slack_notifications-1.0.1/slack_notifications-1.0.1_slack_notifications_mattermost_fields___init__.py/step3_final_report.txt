  "purpose": "Re-export a symbol 'mrkdwn' from an external module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'slack_notifications.mattermost.fields' retrieving 'mrkdwn'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'mrkdwn' directly used for re-export; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'mrkdwn' from a specified module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple re-export. No data processing, network activity, or external input handling occurs. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's straightforward purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
