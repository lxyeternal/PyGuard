  "purpose": "The code appears to be exporting a single imported component 'mrkdwn' from the 'slack_notifications.mattermost.fields' module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from slack_notifications.mattermost.fields import mrkdwn'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external input are present",
  "flows": "The import flows into the module's namespace, and the '__all__' declaration exposes 'mrkdwn' for external use",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific component and declares it as part of the module's public interface. No data processing, user input, or external data handling occurs. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward module import and export. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
