  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing color mappings and generating random strings",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function arguments (name, code) for init_color; using random.choice for random string generation",
  "sinks": "Modifying the COLOR_MAP dictionary; generating random strings (potentially for identifiers or tokens)",
  "flows": "init_color writes to COLOR_MAP; _random_string generates a string potentially used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: one to initialize a color mapping by updating a shared dictionary, and another to generate a random lowercase string of specified length. The use of string and random modules is standard. No malicious intent detected as there is no data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a utility module for color management and random string creation without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
