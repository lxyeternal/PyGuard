  "purpose": "Generate random lowercase strings and initialize color mappings in a constants dictionary.",
  "sources": "User input is not read; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Modification of the COLOR_MAP dictionary.",
  "flows": "The code modifies a global constant mapping but does not process untrusted data for harmful effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.choice for string generation is benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a random string of specified length using lowercase letters, and a function to initialize or update a color mapping in an imported constants dictionary. There are no input sources from external or untrusted origins; the random string generator uses the standard library's random module without any insecure patterns. The init_color function modifies a global constant mapping but does not introduce any malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve straightforward utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing utility functions for string generation and color mapping. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
