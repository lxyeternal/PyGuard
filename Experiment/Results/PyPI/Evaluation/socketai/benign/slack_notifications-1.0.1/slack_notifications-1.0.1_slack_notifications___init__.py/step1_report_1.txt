{
  "purpose": "The code imports various constants, utility functions, classes, and modules related to Slack and Mattermost notifications, and then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'slack_notifications' modules and constants, including constants, utility functions, resource classes, and various notification block types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are evident; no network calls, file writes, or untrusted data handling shown within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly demonstrated; this code mainly performs import and export of symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All import statements appear standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely import statements and an __all__ export list. It does not process any data, perform I/O, or contain any executable logic beyond module imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is clean, with no indications of security issues or malware. The inclusion of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in __all__ could potentially expose sensitive information if misused, but in this context, it appears to be a constant being exported, not a hardcoded credential.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a module to re-export various notification-related classes, functions, and constants. There are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard.",
