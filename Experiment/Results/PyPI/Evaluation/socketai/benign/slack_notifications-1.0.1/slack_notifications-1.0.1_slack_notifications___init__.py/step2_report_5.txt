  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily import/export statements from the 'slack_notifications' package.\n- No evidence of data processing, network calls, or I/O operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The presence of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in the exports is noted, but it appears to be a constant, not an embedded credential.\n- The code is standard for a module that consolidates and re-exports components for external use.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only performs import/export operations with no executable logic, data flows, or malicious activity.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or security flaws?**  \n  None are evident. The reports do not identify any flaws beyond potential concern over exposing 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in `__all__`, but they clarify that it appears to be a constant, not a secret.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. This seems reasonable.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Exposure of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in `__all__`:**  \n  While it is included in the exports, the reports correctly interpret it as likely a constant, not an embedded secret. If 'ACCESS_TOKEN' were a hardcoded credential, that would be a concern, but there's no evidence here.\n\n- **Potential assumptions about 'ACCESS_TOKEN':**  \n  The reports note that if 'ACCESS_TOKEN' is a secret, exposing it in `__all__` could be risky. However, given the context, it seems to be a module-level constant, not a secret.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, acceptable for a module that only exports constants and classes)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only very minor concern is the exposure of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in `__all__`, but this is likely a constant, not a secret.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, if we assume 'ACCESS_TOKEN' is a non-secret constant)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports various components of a Slack/Mattermost notification library. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk score is justified, and the malware score should remain at zero.",
