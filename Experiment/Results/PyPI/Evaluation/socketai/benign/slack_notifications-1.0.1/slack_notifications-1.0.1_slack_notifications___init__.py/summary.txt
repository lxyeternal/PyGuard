  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an index for re-exporting components. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor concern about 'ACCESS_TOKEN' being exported is likely unwarranted if it is a non-secret constant. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
