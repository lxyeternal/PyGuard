  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the risk/malware scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as merely import/export statements from the 'slack_notifications' package.\n- No data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident.\n- The only potential concern is the inclusion of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in __all__, which could imply exposure if misused, but in this context, it appears to be a constant or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Importing constants, utils, classes, and modules.\n- **Sinks & flows:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward re-export.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n  \n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given no active threats. Malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar structure, noting the import of 'ACCESS_TOKEN' as a potential concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) due to 'ACCESS_TOKEN' being imported. Since the code does not show its definition, it could be a placeholder or a constant. Unless it is a hardcoded secret, this is acceptable. Malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same as above.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are zero, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation in report 3 (0.2) due to 'ACCESS_TOKEN' inclusion. This is reasonable; if 'ACCESS_TOKEN' is just a constant, the risk is minimal. If it were a hardcoded secret, the risk would be higher, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign module solely for import/export purposes.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n- The only minor point is the 'ACCESS_TOKEN' in __all__, which could be a concern if it’s a hardcoded secret, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, depending on whether 'ACCESS_TOKEN' is a sensitive secret. Given the context, 0.2 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0.1 if it's just a constant.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious or obfuscated content.",
