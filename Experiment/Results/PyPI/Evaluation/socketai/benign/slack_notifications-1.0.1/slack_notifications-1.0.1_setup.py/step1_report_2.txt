  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'slack-notifications' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or dangerous operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content (source) for setting long description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file to include a long description, which is typical for setup scripts. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. No external or untrusted inputs are processed beyond reading a local file. The setup configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a local README file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers securely. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.",
