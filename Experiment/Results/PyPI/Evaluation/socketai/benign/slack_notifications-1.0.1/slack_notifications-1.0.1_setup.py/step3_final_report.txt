{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module, reading local README for description, and defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; no untrusted input or dynamic code execution; uses static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions beyond local file reading.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'version_format' parameter in setup(), which is not a standard setuptools argument; likely a typo or misconfiguration but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata, and dependencies. The only unusual aspect is the 'version_format' argument, which is not recognized by setuptools and may cause build issues but does not introduce security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The overall assessment is that the script is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; no changes are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor issue is the non-standard 'version_format' argument, which should be corrected or verified, but it does not pose a security threat. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
