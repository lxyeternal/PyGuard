{
  "purpose": "Converts Slack-like message blocks into Mattermost message format, assembling strings and dictionaries for display.",
  "sources": "Input block objects such as HeaderBlock, SimpleTextBlock, DividerBlock, ImageBlock, ContextBlock, ActionsBlock, ButtonBlock.",
  "sinks": "In-memory string concatenations and dictionary assemblies; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Block objects are processed via handler functions, converting their attributes into formatted strings or dict entries, appended to message or attachments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external calls detected. The code is straightforward and relies on trusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data transformation from block objects to formatted message strings and attachment dictionaries. It uses direct attribute access, string concatenation, and dictionary updates. No external system calls, network activity, or code execution is present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are identified. The logic is consistent, and the data flow is in-memory. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified by the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured message formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
