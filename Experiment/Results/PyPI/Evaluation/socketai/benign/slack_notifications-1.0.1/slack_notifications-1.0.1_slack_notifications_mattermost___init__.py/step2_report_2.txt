  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, security risks, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward import/export module, re-exporting classes, functions, and constants related to Mattermost and Slack notifications. No active data flows, no suspicious behavior, no malware. The constants like `ACCESS_TOKEN` are imported, and their security implications depend on their definitions elsewhere.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is clear and unobfuscated.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — low, considering the presence of sensitive constants.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems reasonable, given that the code itself is benign but could pose a risk if the imported constants are hardcoded secrets elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a simple re-export pattern with no suspicious behavior. The constants are imported, but their security implications depend on their definitions elsewhere.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — no malware.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — clear code.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — appropriate, as no secrets are handled directly here.\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code imports constants like `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BASE_URL`, `TEAM_ID`, which could contain sensitive credentials. These are potential sinks if misused downstream. No active logic or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — considering the presence of sensitive constants, this seems appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is reasonable. The report correctly notes that the constants' security implications depend on their definitions elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Re-export pattern with constants that may contain sensitive data. No active data flows or malicious code. The main concern is the handling of secrets, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — consistent with the presence of potentially sensitive constants.\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on the import of constants that could be sensitive. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is secure management of secrets.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — no malware.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — clear code.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.3 — slightly higher, perhaps reflecting the potential for secrets exposure.\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware present, which is appropriate given the benign import/export pattern.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and transparent.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.3) across reports, which is reasonable considering the presence of constants that could contain secrets. The higher score in Report 5 (0.3) might be justified if the constants are more sensitive or if the report assumes less secure handling elsewhere.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **On the code itself:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities are evident. The main security concern relates to how the imported constants are managed elsewhere in the project.\n\n- **On scoring:** The current scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further context reveals secrets being hardcoded or mishandled.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — considering the potential for secrets in constants, but no active issues.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign; the security concerns are external, related to secret management, not the code structure itself.",
