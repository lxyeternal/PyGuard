  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes, functions, and constants from the slack_notifications.mattermost modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from internal modules (slack_notifications.mattermost.client and fields).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports and re-exports symbols; no data flow or processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The constants (ACCESS_TOKEN, BASE_URL, TEAM_ID) are imported from internal modules; their security implications depend on their definitions elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from internal modules and then explicitly exports them for external use. This pattern is common for organizing public API surfaces. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior is visible in these import/export statements. There are no data flows, input reading, or untrusted data handling in this snippet. The presence of constants like ACCESS_TOKEN suggests sensitive data may be stored or used elsewhere, but nothing in this code indicates misuse or compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module re-export pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. Any security concern related to the constants depends on their definitions elsewhere, but in this snippet, the code itself is benign.",
