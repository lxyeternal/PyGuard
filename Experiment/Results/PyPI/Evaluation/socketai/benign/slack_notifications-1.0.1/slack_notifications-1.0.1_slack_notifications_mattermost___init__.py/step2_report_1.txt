  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import and re-export module, exposing constants and classes related to Mattermost and Slack notifications.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The constants imported (ACCESS_TOKEN, BASE_URL, TEAM_ID) are likely configuration parameters, potentially containing sensitive data.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious intent, just re-exporting symbols. Concerns about imported constants possibly containing secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code itself is benign.  \n- The concern about secrets in imported constants is valid but outside the scope of this snippet.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the potential for secret exposure if these constants are hardcoded elsewhere.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No changes needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the import/export pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity.  \n- The security risk is minimal here; constants are imported, not hardcoded.  \n- The confidence is high, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential use of sensitive constants in network functions like `send_notify`.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code snippet doesn't show any network calls or usage of these constants; they are only imported.  \n- The concern about sensitive data being used downstream is valid but speculative based on this fragment.  \n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, considering the potential for misuse elsewhere.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on the handling of sensitive constants.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk is low, given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the potential security implications of exposing constants like ACCESS_TOKEN.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Since the constants are imported, the risk depends on their actual definitions elsewhere.  \n- The code itself is not malicious, but exposing sensitive constants could be risky if not properly managed.  \n- The security risk score of 0.3 seems reasonable, reflecting moderate concern about secret exposure.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.2–0.3), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward import/export)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (moderate, due to potential secret exposure if constants are hardcoded elsewhere)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores align with the code's benign nature.\n- The main concern is the handling of sensitive data in constants, but that is outside this code snippet's scope.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate.
