  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code imports specific classes, functions, and constants from internal modules related to Slack and Mattermost notifications, then re-exports them via `__all__`. The constants include `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BASE_URL`, and `TEAM_ID`, which are likely configuration or credential data. The code itself is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Main points:** The code is a simple import/export module. No malicious intent or obfuscation. Concerns about imported constants containing hardcoded secrets are outside this snippet.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malware or malicious behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the potential for secrets elsewhere, but not within this code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Main points:** Re-exporting symbols; no suspicious activity. Constants may contain secrets, but their definitions are outside this snippet.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the high confidence score aligns with that.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Main points:** Imports constants that could contain sensitive credentials; no active network or data flow in this snippet. No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The potential security concern is with how these constants are managed elsewhere, not in this code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Main points:** Similar to previous; re-exporting symbols, with potential concern over handling of sensitive constants.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, but the presence of sensitive constants warrants careful secret management.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Main points:** Re-exporting configuration constants that may contain credentials; no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.3, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The slightly higher risk score reflects the potential security implications of exposing configuration constants.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting potential secret management issues rather than code malice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code itself is a standard import/export module with no active logic, dynamic code, or data handling.\n- The presence of constants like `ACCESS_TOKEN` is a common pattern for configuration, but their security implications depend on how they are managed elsewhere.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (potential security concern if secrets are hardcoded or mishandled elsewhere)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the context. The main security concern relates to secret management outside this snippet, not the code itself.",
