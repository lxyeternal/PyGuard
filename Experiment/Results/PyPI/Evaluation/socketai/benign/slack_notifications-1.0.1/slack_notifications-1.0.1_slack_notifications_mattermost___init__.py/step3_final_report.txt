{
  "purpose": "This module imports and re-exports classes, functions, and constants related to Mattermost and Slack notifications, serving as an interface layer.",
  "sources": "Constants such as ACCESS_TOKEN, BASE_URL, TEAM_ID imported from internal modules; no direct input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported constants in downstream network calls or data handling, but not within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported constants may flow into functions like send_notify or call_resource elsewhere, but no flow occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module, exposing classes and constants for notification handling. The constants may contain sensitive data, but their definitions are external. No active logic, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The security concern hinges on external secret management, not this code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is proper handling of imported secrets outside this module. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low to moderate security risk (0.2).",
  "confidence": 0.9,
