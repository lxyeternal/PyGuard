  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; all functions operate on their parameters which are expected to be provided programmatically.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly handle or output untrusted data streams; they only format input parameters into strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sensitive sinks; functions simply return formatted strings based on provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple string formatters, converting input parameters into Markdown-style syntax. There are no input reads from external sources, no dynamic execution, and no network or system calls. The functions do not perform any insecure operations or data leaks. Overall, the code appears to serve purely formatting purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of text formatting utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code is benign and appears to be utility functions for documentation or chat formatting.",
