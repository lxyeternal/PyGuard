{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for formatting text with markdown-like syntax, including bold, italic, strike-through, code blocks, block quotes, list items, links, and mentions.",
  "sources": "Input data to formatting functions such as text, URLs, user IDs, channel identifiers, and iterable items.",
  "sinks": "String return statements that produce formatted text; no external data or untrusted input is directly executed or stored.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into return statements, producing formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward and solely format input data into markdown syntax without executing or evaluating input beyond string conversion. No use of eval, exec, or system calls. No network operations, file handling, or data leakage mechanisms. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and does not include obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains harmless utility functions for text formatting with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for formatting output messages.",
