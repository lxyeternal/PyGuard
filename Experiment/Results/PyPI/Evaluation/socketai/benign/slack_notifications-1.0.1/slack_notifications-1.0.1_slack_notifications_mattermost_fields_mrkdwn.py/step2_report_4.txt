  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as simple, straightforward formatting utilities that generate markdown-like syntax.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified: no dynamic execution, no external data handling, no network or file operations.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the described benign nature.\n- The functions do not process untrusted input beyond string conversion, which is typical for formatting helpers.\n\n**Confirming the code's presence of issues:**\n- The code appears correct and does not contain any errors, flaws, or vulnerabilities based on the provided descriptions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Logical or reasoning flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; all analyses point to safe, utility functions.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n  - `confidence: 1`\n- These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and the analysis.\n\n**Challenging potential issues:**\n- Since the functions only format input data, they are unlikely to introduce vulnerabilities unless used improperly downstream (e.g., inserting formatted strings into unsafe contexts like HTML without sanitization). However, this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- The code is a set of benign, straightforward formatting functions.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The risk score should be 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence remains high at 1, given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The supply chain risk is minimal; the functions are utility helpers.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThe reports' assessments are accurate and align with the code's nature.",
