  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Behavior:**\n   - All functions are simple string formatters converting input parameters into markdown-like syntax.\n   - There are no external data fetches, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, no file I/O, and no handling of untrusted input beyond basic string conversion.\n   - The functions do not perform any validation, sanitization, or escaping, but that is typical for formatting utilities intended for controlled contexts.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - No use of eval, exec, or system calls.\n   - No external dependencies or code that could be exploited.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The purpose is clearly to generate formatted strings, likely for documentation, chat, or messaging purposes.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is harmless, straightforward, and safe.\n   - The confidence levels are at 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the functions only format strings, risks are minimal.\n   - If these functions are used with untrusted input in an HTML context, there could be injection issues, but within the scope of this code, no such risks are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code does not execute or process untrusted data in a way that would cause vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n6. **Summary and Final Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a benign set of utility functions for text formatting.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or supply chain risks.\n   - The scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is a harmless utility with no security concerns.",
