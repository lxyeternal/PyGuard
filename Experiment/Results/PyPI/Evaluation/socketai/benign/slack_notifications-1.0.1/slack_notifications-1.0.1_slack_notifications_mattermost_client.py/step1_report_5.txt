{
  "purpose": "Implement a client for sending notifications and interacting with a Mattermost server, including message sending, file uploading, and reactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for access token, base URL, and team ID; function parameters for channel, message content, attachments, and files; JSON responses from API calls.",
  "sinks": "API resource calls for sending messages, uploading files, adding/removing reactions, and patching/deleting posts.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or function parameters -> processed into API request data -> API calls to Mattermost server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no unusual code structures or obfuscation detected; external input sources are environment variables and function arguments, standard for such clients.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical API client with methods for messaging, file upload, reactions, and resource management. No hardcoded credentials are found; environment variables are used for secrets, which is standard. API interactions follow expected patterns. No malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behavior is evident. The functions for sending notifications and uploading files properly handle inputs and responses. The code uses standard libraries and no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Mattermost notification client, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses environment variables for sensitive data and performs expected API interactions. No malware or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
