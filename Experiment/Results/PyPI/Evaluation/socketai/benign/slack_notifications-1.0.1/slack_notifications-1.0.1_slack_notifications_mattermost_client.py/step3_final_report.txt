{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for interacting with the Mattermost API, supporting sending notifications, uploading files, managing reactions, and updating or deleting messages.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for tokens, URLs, and team IDs; reads files from disk during uploads; processes JSON responses from API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Uses API calls to send notifications, upload files, add/remove reactions, update or delete messages; no untrusted data is directly executed or injected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials -> API calls send/modify data -> responses are processed for message IDs and file info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity; use of `_random_string` for filenames is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with proper handling of secrets via environment variables, standard REST interactions, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. File handling is typical, and no covert channels or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Mattermost API client with no malicious intent or security flaws. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
