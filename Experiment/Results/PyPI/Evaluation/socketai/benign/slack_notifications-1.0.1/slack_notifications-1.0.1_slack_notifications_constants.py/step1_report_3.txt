  "purpose": "Definition of a color map dictionary associating color names with their hex codes",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not write or transmit data",
  "flows": "No data flows or data transformations occur within this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward dictionary definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary named COLOR_MAP with color names as keys and corresponding hex color codes as values. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The content appears to be a standard color mapping used for UI or graphical purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static dictionary mapping color names to hex codes with no malicious or security concern. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of color referencing.",
