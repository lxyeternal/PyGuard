  "purpose": "Static dictionary mapping color names to hexadecimal color codes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static data defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; static data used internally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate keys 'cyan' and 'aqua' which result in 'aqua' overwriting 'cyan'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary with color name to hex code mappings. The duplicate key 'cyan'/'aqua' is a minor issue in Python, causing 'aqua' to overwrite 'cyan', but it does not pose a security risk. No dynamic code, external input, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static dictionary with a minor logical issue (duplicate key). It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
