  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals and constants for use in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals used as type annotations for various AWS services, regions, and resources.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static literals are used for type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is a straightforward type annotations module. The only potential concern is the inclusion of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), but this is likely a typographical or illustrative mistake and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional imports for Python version compatibility, string literal type definitions for AWS service names, resource names, and regions, and an explicit list of all exported identifiers. The 'if sys.version_info' block ensures compatibility across Python versions. All defined literals are static, hardcoded strings, typical for type definitions. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing. The copyright statement's year (2025) may seem unusual, but it is harmless. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static type annotation definition for AWS service and resource names. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright, which does not impact security.",
