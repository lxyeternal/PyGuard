  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literal names for use in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module and reading Python version info; defining string literal types for various AWS services, regions, and resource names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines constants and type annotations without processing untrusted input or performing I/O.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks, as this is a static type definition module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and solely consists of type aliases and conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version >= 3.12, then defines multiple string literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, and regions. The module appears to be intended solely for type annotations and documentation purposes. No code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present, minimizing security concerns. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS service literals, intended for type safety and documentation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
