  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals to be used in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for string literals representing AWS service names, resource types, and regions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines a series of type aliases as string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, and regions. The purpose is to enhance type checking and documentation. There are no input data sources, network operations, or runtime data handling. All constants are static string literals. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or potentially malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and designed solely for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type definition module for AWS service literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
