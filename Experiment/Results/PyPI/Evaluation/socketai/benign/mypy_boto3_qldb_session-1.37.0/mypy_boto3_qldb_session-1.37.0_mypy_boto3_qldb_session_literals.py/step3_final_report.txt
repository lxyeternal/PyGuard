  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS services, resources, and regions with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type annotations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' appears to be a future or placeholder date, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module providing type annotations for AWS service names, resources, and regions. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely for type safety and documentation, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations for AWS services. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which does not impact security. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
