  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations for AWS services. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which does not impact security. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
