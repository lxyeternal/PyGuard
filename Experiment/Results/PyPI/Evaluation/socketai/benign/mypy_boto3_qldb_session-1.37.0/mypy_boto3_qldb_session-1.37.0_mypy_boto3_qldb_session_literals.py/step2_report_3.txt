  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, straightforward module defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, and regions.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The only anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which appears to be a typographical or illustrative mistake rather than malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and solely for type annotations.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** Malware and security risk scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n- **Is the risk score justified?**  \n  **Yes.** Given the absence of any malicious activity, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Is the malware score accurate?**  \n  **Yes.** No malicious behavior is detected; malware score is 0.\n\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All observations are based on static code analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All reports align in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- The code is a static type annotations module, with no runtime behavior or data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- The only minor point is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which does not affect security.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definition module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the nature of the code as purely static type annotations for AWS service names, resources, and regions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The minor anomaly (future year) is non-malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its intended purpose. No changes to scores or concerns are necessary.",
