  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, and regions.\n- It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typographical or illustrative mistake, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAccurately describes the code as static type annotations with no malicious activity.  \n**Findings:**  \n- No issues present in the code.  \n- The future year (2025) in the copyright is noted but not malicious.  \n- The report's confidence is perfect (1.0).  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Score reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nSame as above, emphasizing the static nature and lack of malicious activity.  \n**Findings:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no dynamic or sensitive data handling.  \n- No anomalies other than the future year, which is not a security concern.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Score reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nHighlights the conditional import and static definitions, with no suspicious patterns.  \n**Findings:**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The code is purely for type annotations.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Score reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nReiterates the static nature, with no external data or dynamic code.  \n**Findings:**  \n- No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.  \n- The only oddity is the copyright year (2025), which is not malicious.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Score reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nNotes the code as benign static definitions, with a slightly lower confidence (0.95).  \n**Findings:**  \n- No malicious activity.  \n- The anomalous future year is not a security concern.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Score reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Minor note:** The only anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports' scores are appropriate.\n- **Additional comments:**  \n  - The code is a standard static type annotations module.  \n  - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.  \n  - The future year in the copyright is not a concern but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
