  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, primarily defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, and regions.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external input handling is present.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- The only unusual element noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is likely a typographical or illustrative mistake, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Claim:** No malicious activity; the code is benign static type definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Analysis:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as above; static definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Analysis:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as above; straightforward type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Claim:** Again, static, benign code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar benign static definitions; notes the future year as an anomaly.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Analysis:** The minor anomaly (future year) does not imply malicious intent; it's likely a comment or typo. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None evident.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Scores for obfuscated and risk:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The only minor point is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright statement, which appears to be an oversight or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The code's purpose is solely static type annotations for AWS service names, resources, and regions, with no dynamic or sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (benign static definitions)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured static type annotations module for AWS services, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The minor anomaly in the copyright year does not impact security.",
