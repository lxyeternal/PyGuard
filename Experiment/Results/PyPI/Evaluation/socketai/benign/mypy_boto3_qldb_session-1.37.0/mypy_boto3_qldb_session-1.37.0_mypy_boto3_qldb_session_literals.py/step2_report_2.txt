  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, type annotation module defining string literals for AWS services, resources, and regions.\n- The code uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external data sources are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is likely a typographical or illustrative mistake, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms the code is benign, purely static, with no malicious intent.  \n   - Notes the future year (2025) as a minor anomaly but not security relevant.  \n   - Malware score: 0.  \n   - Risk score: 0.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Similar conclusion: standard, benign static definitions.  \n   - No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.  \n   - Malware score: 0.  \n   - Risk score: 0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Same as above, straightforward type annotations.  \n   - No signs of malicious activity.  \n   - Malware score: 0.  \n   - Risk score: 0.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Reiterates the benign nature, with no data flow or external processing.  \n   - No anomalies other than the future year comment.  \n   - Malware score: 0.  \n   - Risk score: 0.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still consistent with benign static definitions.  \n   - Notes the copyright year as anomalous but not malicious.  \n   - Malware score: 0.  \n   - Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected. All reports confirm the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as **0**; no malicious activity or signatures are present.\n- **Additional considerations:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or illustrative placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's static, documentation-oriented nature.",
