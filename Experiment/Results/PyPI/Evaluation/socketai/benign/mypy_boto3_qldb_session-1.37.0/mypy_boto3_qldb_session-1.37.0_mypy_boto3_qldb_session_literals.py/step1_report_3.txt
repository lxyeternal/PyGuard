  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literal names for use with boto3-stubs in Python, aiding type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, typing, typing_extensions), variable assignments for Literal types.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly defines type aliases for string literals. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, and regions. The purpose is for type annotations and documentation, not runtime logic or data handling. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The only potential concern might be unnecessary extensive listing, but this is typical for such type alias definitions. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining string literal types for type safety and documentation in boto3 AWS SDK usage. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
