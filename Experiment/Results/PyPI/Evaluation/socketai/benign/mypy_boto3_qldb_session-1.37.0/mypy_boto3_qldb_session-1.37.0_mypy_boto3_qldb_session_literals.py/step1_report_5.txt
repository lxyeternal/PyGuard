  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literals and their categories to improve type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check for conditional import, literal definitions for service names, region names, resource names.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to conditional imports, then to defining multiple Literal type aliases for service names, resource names, and regions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of a copyright notice from 2025, which is anachronistic but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations for AWS service literals, conditionally importing the 'Literal' type depending on Python version, and defining several large tuples of string literals as type aliases. It serves as a static type definition module with no dynamic or untrusted data handling. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The anomalous copyright date is just a comment and not an executable threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static definitions module for AWS service literals, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely provides type annotations for use elsewhere. No security concerns are evident.",
