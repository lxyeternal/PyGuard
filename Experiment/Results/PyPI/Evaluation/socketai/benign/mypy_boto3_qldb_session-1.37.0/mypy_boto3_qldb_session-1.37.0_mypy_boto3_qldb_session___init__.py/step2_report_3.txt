  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code snippets and the assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module that imports a class from a local module, assigns an alias, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The code includes a documentation string with usage examples and a link.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is benign and likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on Code Content:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- It is a straightforward interface module, typical for SDKs or client wrappers.\n- The import from a local `.client` module is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### Error, Flaw, or Mistake in the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly note the absence of security issues, malware, or anomalies.\n- The mention of the future copyright year is benign and not a flaw.\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0 or very low, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n\n- No discrepancies are evident. The assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n**0** — No malicious activity or code.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n**0** — No obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n**0** — No security risk; the code is a simple interface module.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- The code is standard SDK boilerplate code, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for an SDK interface.**\n- **All reports are accurate in their assessments.**\n- **No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nBased on the analysis, I agree with the provided reports' assessments. The overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**. The code is benign, and no further action is necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\nIf further review of related modules or runtime behavior is required, that could be considered, but based solely on this static code snippet, it is entirely safe.",
