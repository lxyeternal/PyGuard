{
  "purpose": "To provide the main interface for the qldb-session service, including documentation and class aliasing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.client import QLDBSessionClient); usage examples within the docstring.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, external connections, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large comment block with documentation and usage example, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a module with a documentation string, imports a class from a local module, assigns an alias, and specifies exports. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The import is from a local relative module, which is standard practice, and there are no network operations or sensitive data handling. The comments provide usage instructions but do not influence security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with documentation and class aliasing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and standard for an SDK interface.",
