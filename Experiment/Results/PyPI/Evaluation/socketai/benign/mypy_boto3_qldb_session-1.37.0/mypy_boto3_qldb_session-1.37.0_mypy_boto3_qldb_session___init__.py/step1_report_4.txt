  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the qldb-session service, mainly re-exporting the QLDBSessionClient class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing QLDBSessionClient from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process input or data flows; it only exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains a license notice, documentation link, and straightforward re-exporting of a class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports QLDBSessionClient from a relative module, assigns it to a variable named Client, and exposes both via __all__. The comment section includes documentation and copyright info. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. It is a typical module setup for a Python SDK or library interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that re-exports a class for client interaction with AWS QLDB sessions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for SDK packaging.",
