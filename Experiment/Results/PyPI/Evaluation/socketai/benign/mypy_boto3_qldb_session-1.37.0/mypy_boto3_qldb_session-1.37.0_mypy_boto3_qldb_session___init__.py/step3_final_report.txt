  "purpose": "Provides main interface, documentation, class aliasing, and re-exporting for qldb-session service.",
  "sources": "Import from local .client module, usage example in documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import and aliasing flow; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), benign placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with documentation, import, aliasing, and export statements. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. The only unusual element is the future copyright year, which is benign. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
