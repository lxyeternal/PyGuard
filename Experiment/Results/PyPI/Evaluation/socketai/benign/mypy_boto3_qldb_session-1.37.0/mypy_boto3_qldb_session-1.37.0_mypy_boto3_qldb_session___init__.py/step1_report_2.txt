{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the qldb-session service, including documentation and export of the client class.",
  "sources": "Imports the QLDBSessionClient class from a local module, and defines a client alias.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code simply exports classes and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and sets export variables. It includes a documentation string with usage examples and a link. There are no external data inputs, no sensitive data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The only unusual element is the future copyright year, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious module for exporting a client class with documentation. No security issues, malware, or anomalies are detected.",
