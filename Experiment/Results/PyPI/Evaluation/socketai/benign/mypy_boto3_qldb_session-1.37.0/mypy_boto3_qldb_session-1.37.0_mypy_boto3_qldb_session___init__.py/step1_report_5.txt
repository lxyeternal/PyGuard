{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for qldb-session service, providing access to the QLDBSessionClient.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.client import QLDBSessionClient).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Importing QLDBSessionClient and assigning it to Client; no data flow involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in 2025, which is in the future but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface or wrapper around the QLDBSessionClient class imported from a local module. It includes a docstring with documentation and usage example, which is standard. No external network calls, no data handling, and no suspicious code features are present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which could be a typo or placeholder but is not malicious. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or sensitive data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly facilitates access to a client class for QLDB sessions.",
