  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a simple module with documentation, class aliasing, and import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The report notes the future copyright year (2025), which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks. The high confidence (1) is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, straightforward module with documentation.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No, aside from the future copyright year.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard interface module, importing and aliasing.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Typical re-exporting module.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, a simple interface module.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No, aside from the future copyright date.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. **My estimate: 0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the code snippets show obfuscation or complex encoding. **My estimate: 0.0**.\n- **Risk score:** The code is purely an interface with documentation and class aliasing, with no data handling, external connections, or dynamic code execution. **My estimate: 0.0**.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The only unusual element is the future copyright year (2025), which is benign and likely a placeholder.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and risk.",
