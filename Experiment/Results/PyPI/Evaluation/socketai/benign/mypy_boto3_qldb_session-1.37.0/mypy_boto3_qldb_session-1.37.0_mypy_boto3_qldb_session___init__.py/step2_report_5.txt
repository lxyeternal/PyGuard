  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores?** None needed; the code is benign.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report avoids assumptions; it correctly identifies the code as safe.\n- **Consistency?** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code remains a simple import and aliasing module.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No; the only unusual element is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification?** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report does not make unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Consistency?** Scores align with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical SDK interface.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. No dynamic code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0.\n- **Justification?** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report remains cautious and accurate.\n- **Consistency?** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard module re-export pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The only oddity is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0.\n- **Justification?** No malicious activity.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report does not assume malicious intent.\n- **Consistency?** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical interface module.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores?** Malware and risk scores are 0.\n- **Justification?** The code is benign.\n- **Potential assumptions?** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Consistency?** Scores match the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
