  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a simple module with documentation, import, aliasing, and export. No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is benign and likely a placeholder.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity. The confidence is 1, which is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, with a future copyright year, but no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, which aligns with the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a simple interface module with no dynamic or external operations.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical re-exporting module with documentation, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern—simple interface with no malicious features.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. No signs of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.  \n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, justified given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard SDK interface module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's benign nature.",
