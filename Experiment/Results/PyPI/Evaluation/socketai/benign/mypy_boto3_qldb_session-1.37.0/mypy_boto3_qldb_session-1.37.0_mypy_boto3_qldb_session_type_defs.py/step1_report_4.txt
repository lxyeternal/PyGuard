  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the qldb-session service, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules and defines type dictionaries and unions, especially based on Python version info.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling or data processing pipelines.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Use of version-dependent imports and type definitions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, data structure definitions using TypedDict, Union types, and conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution mechanisms are present. The code strictly defines data types for use in other parts of the application or SDK, with no embedded or hidden code, nor external communication or side effects. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of type definitions for the qldb-session SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It contains no runtime code or external data handling that could be malicious. The overall security risk is very low.",
