  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations for boto3 qldb-session, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report accurately states the code is purely static type definitions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static type annotations, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely for type checking, with no runtime logic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same observations as above: purely static type definitions, no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, focused on static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly higher securityRisk score.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:**  \nThe report assigns a very low security risk despite no malicious activity. Since the code is purely static type definitions, the minimal score seems appropriate. The slight elevation might be due to the inclusion of version-dependent imports, but this does not constitute a security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar to others: static type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 for securityRisk, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of static type annotations for the boto3 qldb-session service.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in one report is reasonable, considering the version-dependent imports, but does not indicate any real security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk score (securityRisk):** 0.1 (acceptable, minimal)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, purely for static type checking, with no security risks or malware. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
