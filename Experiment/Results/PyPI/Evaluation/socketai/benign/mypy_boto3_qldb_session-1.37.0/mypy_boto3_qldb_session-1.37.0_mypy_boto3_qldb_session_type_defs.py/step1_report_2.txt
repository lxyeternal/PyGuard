{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the qldb-session service, used to facilitate type checking and documentation in Python code interacting with AWS QLDB.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, imports from system and third-party modules, and defines data structure types; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious actions; all data structures are for type annotations and do not execute code or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code defines type aliases and data structures used throughout other modules; there are no runtime flows, input/output handling, or external data processing flows present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code is purely type definition for documentation and type checking, with no dynamic or reflective code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements conditioned on Python version, type aliasing, and class definitions using TypedDict for structured data. No runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious constructs are observed. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of a copyright statement and documentation link, which do not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions intended for type checking and documentation purposes. It contains no executable code, external data handling, or behaviors that could be malicious. The absence of runtime logic, data processing, or external data sources suggests no security risks or malware presence.",
