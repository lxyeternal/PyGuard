{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the qldb-session service, facilitating type safety and clarity in Python code interacting with Amazon QLDB sessions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, builtins, botocore.response, and internal class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no external data outputs or network calls are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Data structures are defined for request and response types; no runtime data flows are present in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily consists of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type definitions for use with a boto3 client. It includes version-dependent imports for compatibility, and type hints for request/response structures, including nested dictionaries and unions. There are no functions executing logic, external data handling, or runtime operations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior. The inclusion of docstrings and license info appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured type definition code for a boto3 service, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is designed solely for static type annotations and data structure clarity. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
