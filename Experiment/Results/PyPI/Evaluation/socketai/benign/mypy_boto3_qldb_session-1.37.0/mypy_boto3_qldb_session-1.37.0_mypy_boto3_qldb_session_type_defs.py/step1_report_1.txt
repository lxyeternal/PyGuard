  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the qldb-session service in boto3 stubs",
  "sources": "Module imports, sys.version_info checks, type definition declarations",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling; static type definitions do not process external data directly",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static type definitions serve as type hints only",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions and imports to facilitate static type checking for the boto3 qldb-session service. It uses version checks to ensure compatibility with different Python versions and imports relevant typing constructs. The code defines various TypedDicts and type aliases to specify data structures used in the service. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, and no external inputs handled dynamically. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practice for type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type annotations and data structure definitions with no malicious intent. It serves purely to aid static type checking and documentation. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
