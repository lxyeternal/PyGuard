{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the qldb-session service used in Python code for AWS QLDB interactions, mainly for type hinting and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard modules (__future__, sys, typing, collections.abc, typing_extensions) and imports from external libraries (botocore.response). No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present. No network or file I/O operations are included in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing paths; the code only defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and static type annotations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type hinting module with structured data definitions for a service interface, including conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It employs standard typing practices, and no executable or malicious behavior is included. It uses standard libraries and external type extension modules appropriately. The absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive operations indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining data types and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard type definition module used for type hinting in a larger project. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain risks are detected.",
