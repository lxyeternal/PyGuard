  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the boto3 qldb-session service, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or runtime input; only static type definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or external data flow; static type annotations do not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version; no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDicts, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no functions, runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation. The code serves as a type stub for static analysis and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static type annotations for the AWS QLDB session SDK. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
