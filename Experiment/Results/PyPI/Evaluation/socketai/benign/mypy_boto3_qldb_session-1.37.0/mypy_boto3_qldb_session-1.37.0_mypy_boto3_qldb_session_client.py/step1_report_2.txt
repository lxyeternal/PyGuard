  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the QLDB session service client, facilitating interaction with AWS QLDB via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, property methods, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; functions do not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code defines types and class structures without data processing or control flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors detected; the code is standard for a boto3 client wrapper with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for a boto3 QLDB session client, including exception handling, method signatures, and property accessors. All imports are standard, and no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The methods are documentation placeholders without executable logic that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and client class wrapper for the AWS QLDB session service, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
