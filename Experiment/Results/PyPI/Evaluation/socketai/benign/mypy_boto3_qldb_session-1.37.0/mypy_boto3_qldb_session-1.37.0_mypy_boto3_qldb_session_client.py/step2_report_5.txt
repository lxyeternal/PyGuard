  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a type stub/interface for the boto3 QLDB session client, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It contains standard imports, type annotations, and method signatures aligned with boto3 documentation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the fact that the code is primarily a type annotation interface with no active logic.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a straightforward client wrapper with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and standard patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — negligible, consistent with the description.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The methods are typical for boto3 clients, and no dynamic code or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the nature of the code being a stub/interface.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports, a well-structured, standard SDK client wrapper with no suspicious patterns or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard type annotations and class definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- All reports describe code that is a standard, well-structured SDK interface/stub for AWS QLDB sessions.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The code is primarily for type annotations and method signatures aligned with boto3 documentation.\n- No suspicious data flows, code injections, or dynamic behaviors are detected.\n- The low risk scores are justified, and malware scores are correctly zero.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal, consistent with the code's purpose as a type stub/interface.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and free of security issues.**",
