  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the QLDB session client for boto3, facilitating SDK interactions with Amazon QLDB.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the send_command method, which accepts **kwargs with a specific type definition, and generate_presigned_url method that generates URLs with parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from method calls flow through to boto3 client methods, with some parameters used to generate URLs or send commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious URL generation. The code primarily defines types, classes, and methods conforming to boto3 standards.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type annotation and class wrapper for boto3's QLDB session client. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines exception types, and provides method signatures with typing hints. No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic detected. The send_command method relies on external type definitions; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type stub and client wrapper for the boto3 QLDB session service. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It serves as a typing aid or interface for interacting with AWS services.",
