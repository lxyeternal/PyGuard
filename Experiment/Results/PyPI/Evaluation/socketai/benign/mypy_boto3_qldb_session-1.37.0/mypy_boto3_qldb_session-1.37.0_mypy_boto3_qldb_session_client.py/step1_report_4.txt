{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with the Amazon QLDB session service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and relative import of type_defs; class attributes and methods; property and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods like generate_presigned_url and send_command could potentially handle untrusted data if misused, but in this context they are typical boto3 client wrappers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., Params, ClientMethod, kwargs) flow into methods that generate URLs or send commands, which are standard for AWS SDKs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage aligns with standard SDK client wrapper patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typed client class for QLDB sessions, with type annotations, exception mappings, and standard client method definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic present. The code is a straightforward interface wrapper with clear, documented method signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard AWS SDK client interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and follows typical patterns for such clients.",
