  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the boto3 QLDB session service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, sys version info checks, class and method definitions, including method parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Parameters such as Params in generate_presigned_url, kwargs in send_command, and operation_name in can_paginate, which could be misused if untrusted data is passed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters (Params, kwargs, operation_name) to underlying SDK calls; no external data sources or network interactions are present within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; code is a straightforward SDK stub with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for boto3's QLDB session client, including class definitions, properties, and method signatures with appropriate type annotations. It contains no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. The parameters are typical for SDK methods, and the code relies on external libraries for actual functionality. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified as a precaution, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It is a standard type stub for AWS SDK, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.",
