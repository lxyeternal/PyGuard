  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the qldb-session service client, used for interacting with Amazon QLDB via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class method signatures; property definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or operations involving untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (e.g., generate_presigned_url, send_command) take input data; but no flows indicate malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code consists of standard type annotations and class/method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for a boto3 client class and associated exceptions. It imports necessary modules, conditionally imports based on Python version, and declares a class with methods matching boto3 client patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The structure is consistent with typical SDK interface definitions. No external code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python SDK interface for QLDB session client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
