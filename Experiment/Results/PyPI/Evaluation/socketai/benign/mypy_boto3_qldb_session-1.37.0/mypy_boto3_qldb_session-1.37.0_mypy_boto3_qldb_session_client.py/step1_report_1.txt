  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the QLDB Session client to interface with AWS services using boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class attribute definitions; method definitions with parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Methods that return data (e.g., generate_presigned_url, send_command), which could potentially handle untrusted input or expose data if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (e.g., Params, kwargs) to outputs like URL strings or command results, but no direct untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden backdoors. Use of type annotations and property methods appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client interface class for AWS QLDB sessions, with type annotations and exception handling structures. It imports necessary modules, sets conditional imports for compatibility, and specifies method signatures aligned with boto3 documentation. No malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The methods serve typical API interaction purposes, with clear documentation links. There are no indications of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured interface for AWS QLDB session client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily provides type annotations and method signatures based on boto3 documentation, which is common for SDK stub files.",
