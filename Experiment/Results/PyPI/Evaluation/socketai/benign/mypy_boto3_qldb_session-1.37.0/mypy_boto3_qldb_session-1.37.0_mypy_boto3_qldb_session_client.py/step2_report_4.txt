  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a type stub/interface for the QLDB session client, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors. The high confidence (0.9) and malware score (0) align with a benign SDK interface.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is standard, with proper type annotations and documentation.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is a straightforward type annotation and client class wrapper, with no suspicious code or obfuscation. The confidence is even higher (1), and malware score remains 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns; the code is a typical SDK stub.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, a standard SDK wrapper with type annotations, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious behaviors. The confidence is 0.9, malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; the code appears safe and legitimate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard, well-structured, no malicious activity, and a high confidence (1).  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard SDK interface, no malicious or obfuscated code, high confidence, malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), aligning with the fact that this is a client SDK interface, not executable logic that could be exploited.  \n- **Potential concerns:** The only potential \"risk\" could be misuse of the client methods if an attacker controls the input parameters, but this is inherent to any SDK interface and not specific to this code. No evidence of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, a slightly higher but still low risk score (e.g., 0.1) is reasonable, mainly due to the potential for misuse if misconfigured, but no actual security flaw exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the content. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk of SDK misuse, but not a security flaw)\n\n**Final note:** This is a safe, legitimate SDK stub for AWS QLDB session client.",
