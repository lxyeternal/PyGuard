  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or data flows are present.\n- The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future year \"2025\" in the version string, which may be a placeholder or oversight but is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code snippet is just a static assignment with a comment.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n- **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws in Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- The mention of the future year \"2025\" as potentially unusual is accurate but not harmful.\n- No flawed reasoning detected.\n\n**3. Score Justification:**\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk is 0, as there's no dynamic behavior or external data handling.\n- The confidence score of 1.0 is justified, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**4. Potentially Higher Risk Scores?**\n- None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a higher score.\n- The code is a typical version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**5. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are accurate.\n- The mention of the future year \"2025\" does not imply any vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores:**\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, I agree with the given scores:  \n  - Malware: **0.0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0.0**  \n  - Security Risk: **0.0**\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only minor point is the future year \"2025\" in the version string, which could be flagged as a placeholder or oversight, but it does not impact security.\n- No further action needed; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- I concur with the assessments.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.",
