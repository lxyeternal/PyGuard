  "purpose": "Define the source of truth for the package version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable with a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code is static and does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded version string with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. The only notable aspect is the future year (2025), which might indicate a placeholder or oversight but is not suspicious or malicious. There are no data flows, external inputs, or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for version declaration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
