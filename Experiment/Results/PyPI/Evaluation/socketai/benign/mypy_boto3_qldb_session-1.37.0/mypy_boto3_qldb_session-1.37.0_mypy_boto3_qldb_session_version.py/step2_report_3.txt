  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.  \n   There are no dynamic operations, input handling, external data flows, or code execution involved.  \n   The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - **Malicious activity or malware**: None of the reports detect any malicious behavior. The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Obfuscation**: The code is straightforward, with an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risks**: Given the static assignment and lack of external interactions, the security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n3. **Analysis of the \"Future Year\" (2025)**:  \n   - The only notable anomaly is the use of the year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2024).  \n   - This might suggest a placeholder, a future plan, or an oversight, but it does not introduce any security concern or malicious intent.  \n   - No evidence suggests this is malicious or suspicious.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which is reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n   - The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \n   - No discrepancies are evident.  \n   - The only point of discussion could be whether the \"future year\" warrants a slightly higher security or risk score, but since it is not inherently malicious, keeping the scores at 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 — No security risks present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The only unusual aspect is the future year, which does not impact security.\n\n**My recommended scores are consistent with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0.0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0\n\nNo changes necessary.",
