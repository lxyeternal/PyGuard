  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No external input or data; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely static code.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future year '2025' in version string; no malicious implications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment. No dynamic code, input, or external data handling is present. The only unusual aspect is the future year '2025', which appears to be a placeholder or oversight but does not introduce security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with a confidence of 1. The code aligns with standard practices and shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The minor anomaly of the future year does not impact security or functionality. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
