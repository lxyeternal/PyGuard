  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, or data flows. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - No significant errors are apparent.  \n   - The only minor point is the mention of the future year \"2025\" in the version string (Report 3). While unusual, this is not an error or security concern but could be a placeholder or oversight.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n   - The confidence score is 1.0 in all cases, which is reasonable since the analysis is straightforward.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.  \n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code is a straightforward, standard version declaration.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.  \n- The only minor point is the future year in the version string, which does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, standard, and carries no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
