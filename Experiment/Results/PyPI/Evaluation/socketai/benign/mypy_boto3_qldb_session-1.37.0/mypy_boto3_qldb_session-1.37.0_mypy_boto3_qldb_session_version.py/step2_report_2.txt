  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling is present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - The code is a standard practice in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - The only notable point is the use of a future year (2025) in the version string, which might be a placeholder or oversight, but this is not a security concern.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The only questionable aspect is the future year, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature of the snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the existing assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.",
