{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint for a package that provides information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() for output; sys.argv for input.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) triggers conditional logic, which leads to printing package info or version via sys.stdout.write().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; no dynamic execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides package metadata based on command-line input. It does not read untrusted data from external sources, does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. The functions are straightforward, with no indication of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code is well-structured, simple, and focused on printing static information. There are no anomalies or signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this code.",
