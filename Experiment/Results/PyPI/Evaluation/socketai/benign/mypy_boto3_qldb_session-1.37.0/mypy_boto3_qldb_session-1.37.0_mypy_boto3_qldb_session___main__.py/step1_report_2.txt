  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package info and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (write output), sys.argv (read command-line args).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check in main() leads to calling print_version() or print_info(), which write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple CLI output functions. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version info or package info. There are no external data sources, network connections, or sensitive data handling. The functions only output static strings. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script used for informational output. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
