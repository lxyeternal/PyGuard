  "purpose": "CLI script to display package information and version details",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; no obfuscated or suspicious language features",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes based on command-line input. No external data sources, no network activity, and no code injections are present. The functions only output static text to stdout. The flow is straightforward: if '--version' is present, print version; otherwise, print package info. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying package info and version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
