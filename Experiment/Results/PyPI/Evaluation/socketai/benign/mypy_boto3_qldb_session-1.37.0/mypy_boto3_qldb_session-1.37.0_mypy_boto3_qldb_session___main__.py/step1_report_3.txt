  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) influences whether print_version() or print_info() is called, which then outputs static information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses only standard library functions for output and argument checking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple CLI functions for displaying package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to determine behavior. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed beyond checking for '--version'. The output is static and controlled. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed, no obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code appears benign and consistent with its intended purpose.",
