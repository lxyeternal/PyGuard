  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), no external data sources or untrusted input processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to `sys.stdout`, no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leading to output; otherwise, outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that prints static package info or version based on arguments. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The functions are simple, and the logic is clear. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with no anomalies or malicious activity detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as an informational CLI utility. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
