{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging for the 'mypy-boto3-qldb-session' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and uses static data within the setup() function for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; all data used is hardcoded or read from files.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of static, benign package configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup file, importing necessary modules, reading a markdown file for description, and calling setup() with static parameters. No dynamic execution, environment variables, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code adheres to typical Python packaging practices, and all data appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, conventional setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
