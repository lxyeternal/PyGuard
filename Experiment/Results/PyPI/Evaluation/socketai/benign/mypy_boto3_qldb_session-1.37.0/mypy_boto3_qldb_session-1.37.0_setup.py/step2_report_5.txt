  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No suspicious code, external command execution, or dynamic behavior is reported.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The code reads a local README file, defines static metadata, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with no untrusted input or external data processing.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: a typical setup.py for packaging.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- No dynamic or runtime code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- Dependencies are specified correctly, with conditional dependencies based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is a standard, safe setup script.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The only minor note: the URL for the source repository points to `\"https://github.com/youtype/mypy_boto3_builder\"` which appears different from the package name (`mypy_boto3_qldb_session`). This is likely just a project URL, not an issue, but could be double-checked for correctness.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- None needed; the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is safe based on static analysis. Given the code is purely static configuration, this is justified.\n- No hidden malicious code or obfuscation is suggested or evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The script is a straightforward, static package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python setup script with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's content.",
