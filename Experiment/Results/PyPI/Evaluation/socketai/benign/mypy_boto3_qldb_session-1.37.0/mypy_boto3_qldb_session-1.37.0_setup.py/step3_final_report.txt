{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-qldb-session, used to package and distribute the Python library with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> calls setup() with static data; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports Path and setuptools, reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with static metadata including package info, URLs, classifiers, dependencies, and package data. It does not execute any untrusted input, run external commands, or contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals point to a benign, standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard Python package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
