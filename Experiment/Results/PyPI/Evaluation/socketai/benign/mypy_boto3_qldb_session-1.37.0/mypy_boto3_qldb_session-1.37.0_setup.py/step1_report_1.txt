{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-qldb-session package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Path to README.md for long description, package data for mypy type stubs, package configuration parameters, dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no code executes untrusted input or data flows to insecure or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines static configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscation or unusual language features. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools for packaging. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No untrusted input handling or execution of external commands is present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The install_requires line uses environment-based conditional dependency specification, which is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and safe configuration for packaging the library.",
