  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, expect-like SSH interaction utility built on Paramiko. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code performs expected functions with no signs of malicious activity. The securityRisk score is low but not zero, possibly reflecting the inherent risks in SSH automation tools if misused.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign, standard nature of the code. No malicious behaviors, no external network activity beyond SSH.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Well-justified. The absence of malware or obfuscation aligns with the code's apparent purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard expect-like SSH utility with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion; legitimate SSH interaction code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which is consistent with the code's nature. It doesn't perform any malicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** Given the code's purpose (SSH automation), the main concern is misuse or misconfiguration. The scores of 0.2 are cautious but acceptable, considering that any automation tool can be risky if misused.\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- Obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- Security risk scores could be lowered to 0 in all cases, given the benign nature of the code, unless there's context about its deployment environment.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with the analysis)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (unless considering potential misuse, but as per code review, the code itself is benign)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, expect-like SSH interaction utility built on Paramiko. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious routines, or suspicious network activity. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the security risk could be further minimized to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
