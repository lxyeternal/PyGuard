  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SSH interaction library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score can be minimized to 0, as the code itself is benign. Overall, it poses minimal security concern when used as intended."
