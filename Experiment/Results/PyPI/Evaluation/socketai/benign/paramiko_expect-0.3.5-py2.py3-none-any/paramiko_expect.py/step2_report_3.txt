  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of an SSH interaction library based on Paramiko.\n- It provides expect-like pattern matching, command sending, tailing, and terminal control.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on well-known libraries and standard patterns for SSH automation.\n- No external network activity beyond SSH sessions is present.\n- The functions and logic are consistent with legitimate SSH automation tools.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; describes standard SSH interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for SSH automation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, considering the nature of the code)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is a legitimate SSH expect-like utility.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0 (minimal risk)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is a standard SSH automation utility.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, given the code's benign purpose)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is a legitimate SSH interaction library.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is a standard SSH automation utility.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate. Some reports have assigned 0, which is also acceptable.\n\n**However, considering the code's purpose:**\n\n- It provides powerful automation capabilities that could be misused if deployed maliciously.\n- But in the code itself, no malicious features are present.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential misuse if misapplied, but not inherent in the code)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard SSH automation library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores in the reports are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential for misuse but not the code's inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.2**       |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and designed for legitimate SSH automation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's characteristics.",
