  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's behavior.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as an expect-like SSH interaction utility built on Paramiko.\n- No report indicates any obfuscated code, hidden routines, or suspicious behaviors.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), aligning with benign, expected functionality.\n- The code handles standard SSH operations: reading/writing data, pattern matching, terminal control, and output display.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external network connections beyond SSH are mentioned.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Code presence of issues:**\n- The code appears standard; no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hidden behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and practices for SSH automation.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code is present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The reports do not identify any logical or security flaws.\n- The code seems well-structured and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports give a malware score of 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero (0.2), which is cautious but acceptable.\n\n**Potential overestimations:**\n- Since no suspicious activity is detected, a malware score higher than 0 is unwarranted.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for risk and malware scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated routines.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk (0.2):** Slightly above zero, possibly reflecting general caution for network automation scripts, but not indicating actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal risk, standard SSH automation.\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and align with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, expect-like SSH interaction utility.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications needed; the assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall scores should remain as reported: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.",
