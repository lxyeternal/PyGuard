  "purpose": "Unit testing script for the 'roman' module, validating conversion functions and argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), standard output (sys.stdout), and imports the 'roman' module.",
  "sinks": "Writes to standard output (sys.stdout). Uses sys.argv for input parameters. Calls 'roman' functions which may process data.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs → roman.parse_args() and main() functions → output to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical unit testing setup that exercises functions in the 'roman' module, including argument parsing, conversion, and error handling. It manipulates sys.argv to simulate command-line inputs and captures sys.stdout output for verification. There are no indications of external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code. The use of standard libraries and the absence of suspicious patterns suggest benign behavior. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with normal testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script for a Roman numeral conversion library. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
