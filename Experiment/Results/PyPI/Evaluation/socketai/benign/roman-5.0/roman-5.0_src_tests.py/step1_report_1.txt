  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for the roman module, validating conversion functions and argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), standard output (sys.stdout), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Writes to standard output (sys.stdout) during test execution; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs influence program behavior, but only within controlled test scenarios; output flows to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.argv and sys.stdout in tests is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of unit tests for a Roman numeral conversion library. It modifies sys.argv to simulate command-line inputs and captures stdout for output verification. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The imports are standard, and no external or suspicious library behavior is present. The code is typical of test scripts and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the roman module, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely within the testing context, manipulating command-line args and output streams without any malicious side effects.",
