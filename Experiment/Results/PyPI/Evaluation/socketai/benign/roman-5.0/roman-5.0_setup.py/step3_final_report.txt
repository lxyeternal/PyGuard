{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'roman', defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects; defines a console script entry point.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to build description; no data flow from untrusted sources; entry point points to 'roman:main' function in the package.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context managers for reading files, which could lead to resource leaks but not security issues; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, static setup configuration for a Python package. It reads files for descriptions, defines package metadata, classifiers, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present. The only minor concern is the lack of context managers when opening files, but this does not impact security. The entry point references 'roman:main', but without the implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred from the setup script itself. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
