{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'roman' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description; importing 'setuptools' for setup process.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations; file reads are from static files at setup time.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools to define package metadata, description, classifiers, and entry points. It reads static files for long description content, which is a common practice. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network connections, and no suspicious code segments. The code appears to be a typical, legitimate setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for package configuration purposes.",
