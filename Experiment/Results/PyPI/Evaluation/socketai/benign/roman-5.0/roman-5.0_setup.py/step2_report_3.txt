  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a straightforward setup script, reading static files, no dynamic or untrusted data processing, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the setup is standard, with no suspicious code or data flows.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is typical for Python packaging.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the setup process, noting the 'roman:main' entry point, but finds no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The entry point points to a function likely in the 'roman' module, which is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Mentions the reading of files and the setup process, notes that no untrusted input or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The only minor point is that open() is used without context managers, but this is not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes the reading of files and standard setup process, mentions that open() isn't using 'with', but this isn't malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.",
