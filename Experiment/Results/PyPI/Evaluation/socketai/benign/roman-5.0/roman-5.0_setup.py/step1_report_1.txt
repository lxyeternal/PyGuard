{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'roman' Python package, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long description; gathers metadata from setup() arguments; reads files during execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or output operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads files to construct description strings; passes static metadata into setup(); no dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; straightforward use of setuptools with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads two documentation files for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not process user input, environment variables, or network data. The code is standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign and standard distribution script.",
