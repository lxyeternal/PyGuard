{
  "purpose": "The script converts integers to Roman numerals and vice versa, providing command-line functionality for such conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via command-line argument 'number' which is processed in parse_args() and main() functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the conversion result via print() statements; no data is written to files or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input from command line (args.number) flows through parse_args() to main(), where it is converted and printed. When --reverse flag is used, it flows from args.number into fromRoman() and then output; otherwise, into toRoman().",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code performs straightforward conversion with input validation, regex checking for Roman numeral validity, and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard input validation and regex-based validation for Roman numerals. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The functions perform simple conversions; the regex pattern properly validates Roman numerals, and error handling is appropriate. The command-line interface does not expose any risky behaviors or sensitive data. The code is well-structured, readable, and focused on its purpose without any obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Roman numeral conversion. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are present. It functions as intended for safe use.",
