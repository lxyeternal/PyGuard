{
  "purpose": "Convert between Roman numerals and integers, providing command-line interface for input parsing and conversion.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, specifically 'number' argument; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that process the input number or Roman numeral, and output via print statements.",
  "flows": "User provides input -> input is parsed -> conversion functions process data -> results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regular expression for validation appears standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious system modification.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs input validation, Roman numeral conversion, and command-line argument parsing. The regex pattern validates Roman numeral correctness, and exceptions are properly defined for input errors. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or hidden actions. It uses standard Python libraries and practices. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility for numeral conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard numeral conversion script with proper input validation and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as a command-line tool for converting between Roman numerals and integers.",
