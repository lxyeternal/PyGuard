{
  "purpose": "The script converts between Roman numerals and Arabic numerals, either from input arguments or command-line input.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via command-line arguments (`args.number`) and user input processed through argparse.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the conversion result to standard output using `print()`. No data sinks for untrusted data beyond output.",
  "flows": "Input (from command line) -> parsing/validation -> conversion functions -> output via print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code uses standard regex and exception handling for validation. No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for exceptions, mappings for Roman numerals, and functions to convert to and from Roman numerals. It uses argparse for input handling and regex to validate Roman numerals. The flow involves parsing input, validating, converting, and printing results. No malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard numeral conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local input/output without external dependencies or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
