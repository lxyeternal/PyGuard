{
  "purpose": "Convert between Roman and Arabic numerals, providing command-line interface for conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments ('args.number').",
  "targets": "Output is printed to standard output (stdout).",
  "flows": "Input from command-line -> Conversion functions -> Output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. No network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes user input via command-line arguments, validating and converting between Roman and Arabic numerals. It uses regex to verify Roman numeral correctness, handles special cases (e.g., 'N' for zero), and raises specific exceptions for invalid input types or values. The code adheres to standard Python practices for input parsing, validation, and output. No external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code does not perform any insecure operations, such as executing untrusted code, modifying system files, or transmitting data over the network.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for Roman numeral conversions with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
