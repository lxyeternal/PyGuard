{
  "purpose": "Convert between Roman and Arabic numerals, providing command-line interface for input and output.",
  "sources": "Reads input via command-line argument 'number'. Uses regex to validate Roman numeral input.",
  "sinks": "Prints output to standard output; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument flows into conversion functions, which process the data and output results via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. The regex pattern correctly validates Roman numerals, and conversion functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines conversion functions between Roman numerals and integers, with input validation and error handling. It uses argparse for CLI input, processes data with standard functions, and outputs results via print(). No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present. The code structure is standard, and all dependencies are core Python modules. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard conversion between Roman and Arabic numerals with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility script for command-line use.",
