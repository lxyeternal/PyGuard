  "purpose": "Convert integers to Roman numerals and vice versa, providing command-line interface for conversion.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments parsed in parse_args()",
  "sinks": "Output printed to standard output via print()",
  "flows": "Input received from command-line, processed through validation and conversion functions, output displayed via print()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; regex validation for Roman numerals is standard; no external data sources or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for Roman numeral conversion. It employs standard libraries, proper input validation, exception handling, and clear logic. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The regex accurately validates Roman numerals, and the conversion functions handle edge cases correctly. The command-line interface is typical and does not introduce risks. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for converting between Roman numerals and integers. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to set the security risk score to zero across all reports, reflecting the code's safety.",
