  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for converting between Roman numerals and integers. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to set the security risk score to zero across all reports, reflecting the code's safety."
