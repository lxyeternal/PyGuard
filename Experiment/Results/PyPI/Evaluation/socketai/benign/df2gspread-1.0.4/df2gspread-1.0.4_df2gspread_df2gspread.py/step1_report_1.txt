{
  "purpose": "The code uploads a pandas DataFrame to a Google Spreadsheet, allowing data manipulation and storage via Google Drive.",
  "sources": "User-provided DataFrame 'df'; function parameters such as 'gfile', 'wks_name', 'credentials', and 'start_cell'; external functions 'get_credentials', 'get_file_id', 'get_worksheet'.",
  "sinks": "Google Sheets API via gspread for updating spreadsheet cells; 'gspread.authorize' for authentication; 'wks.resize', 'wks.add_rows', 'wks.add_cols' for sheet modifications.",
  "flows": "DataFrame 'df' is converted to string, then written to spreadsheet cells; credentials are obtained and used to authorize gspread; spreadsheet and worksheet are identified or created; cell ranges are populated with headers and data.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically resizes sheets based on DataFrame size; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no suspicious network connections or obfuscated code detected; no backdoors or hidden malicious logic; exception handling is broad but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly interacts with Google Sheets via gspread, performing data uploads from pandas DataFrames. It obtains credentials securely through a utility function, authenticates, and manages sheets and cell updates accordingly. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden logic. The resizing and cleaning functions appear standard for spreadsheet management. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate data upload and manipulation functions with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data upload utility for Google Sheets, with no indications of malicious activity. It performs standard operations such as resizing sheets, updating cells, and managing credentials, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
