  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are present, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as uploading pandas DataFrames to Google Sheets, using external functions for credentials and sheet management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious network activity. The code's behavior appears standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, focusing on data upload via gspread, with external functions for credentials.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic. External functions are a potential concern but are outside this code's scope.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is low.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious activity evident. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general function, with sheet cleaning and resizing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity. Credential handling via external functions is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, emphasizing data upload, cleaning, resizing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. External functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, with focus on credentials and data transfer.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious network calls or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard DataFrame uploads to Google Sheets, with resizing and cleaning options.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors in the provided code.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal, primarily related to credential management, which is handled via external functions presumed secure.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (0.2), which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a low but non-zero score (e.g., 0.2) is appropriate, mainly due to external credential handling.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for uploading pandas DataFrames to Google Sheets, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected.",
