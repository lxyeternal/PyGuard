  "purpose": "Utility to upload pandas DataFrames to Google Sheets, managing resizing and cleaning operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrame; interacts with external functions for credentials, file ID, and worksheet retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Uses gspread API calls to update worksheet cells; no untrusted data sinks or network exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame to worksheet cells via range selection and update; external credential functions provide access tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. External functions are assumed safe but are external to this code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data upload operations to Google Sheets using gspread, with resizing and cleaning features. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. External functions for credentials and sheet management are external and presumed secure. No network anomalies or suspicious logic are evident. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate data management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for DataFrame upload to Google Sheets, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks identified. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
