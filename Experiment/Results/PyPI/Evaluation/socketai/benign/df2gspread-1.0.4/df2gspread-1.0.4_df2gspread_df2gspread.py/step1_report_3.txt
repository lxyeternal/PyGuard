{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates uploading a pandas DataFrame to a Google Spreadsheet, optionally cleaning the sheet beforehand, and managing sheet resizing.",
  "sources": "Reading credentials via get_credentials(), input via raw_input (if Python 2), reading DataFrame data, and accessing Google Sheets via gspread methods.",
  "sinks": "gspread methods such as authorize(), open_by_key(), resize(), add_rows(), add_cols(), update_cells(), and get_all_values() which interact with Google Sheets, potentially transmitting data.",
  "flows": "User provides DataFrame and parameters -> get_credentials() retrieves credentials -> gspread.authorize() authenticates -> open_by_key() or get_file_id() retrieves file ID -> get_worksheet() obtains worksheet -> optional cleaning via clean_worksheet() -> data transformation and insertion into Google Sheets via update_cells() methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except with raw_input for Python 2 compatibility; no evidence of malicious code such as hardcoded credentials or network calls outside the gspread API; no obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution; all external interactions seem standard for API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages DataFrame uploads to Google Sheets through the gspread API, including resizing and cleaning sheets. Credential acquisition is abstracted via get_credentials(), which is a typical pattern. The script handles data conversion, range calculations, and sheet modifications using standard gspread methods. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The only external data flow involves user credentials and Google API interactions, which are expected and controlled via the library functions. Overall, the code functions as a data upload utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a standard utility for uploading pandas DataFrames to Google Sheets, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It uses legitimate libraries and API calls for data handling and cloud interaction. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. Security risk appears minimal; typical concerns relate to API access permissions rather than malicious intent.",
