  "purpose": "Define version information and author metadata for the Python module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version_info tuple and metadata comments at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code solely defines static variables and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; only metadata and version concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external data, performs straightforward string joining of hardcoded version parts, and contains only comments with author and date information. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present. It appears to be a simple version declaration section typical of a software project.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains only benign metadata and versioning information with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
