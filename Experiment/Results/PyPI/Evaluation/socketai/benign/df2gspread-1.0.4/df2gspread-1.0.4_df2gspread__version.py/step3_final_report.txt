{
  "purpose": "Define version information as static metadata within the code.",
  "sources": "The tuple 'version_info' and the string join operation to create '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads static variables and constructs a version string; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static snippet defining version metadata via a tuple and string join. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely informational, with no potential for malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence scores are justified at 1, given the clarity and simplicity of the code. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information snippet with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The existing reports accurately assess its safety, and the scoring is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
