{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a Python module or script, with no additional functional code or operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code is limited to variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code contains only metadata comments and simple version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The script contains metadata comments about the author, date, and contact information. It then defines a tuple for version info and constructs a version string by joining the first three elements. There are no dynamic imports, user input, network operations, or executable code beyond variable assignment. The code is straightforward and standard for defining version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely informational, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines version metadata with no suspicious behavior.",
