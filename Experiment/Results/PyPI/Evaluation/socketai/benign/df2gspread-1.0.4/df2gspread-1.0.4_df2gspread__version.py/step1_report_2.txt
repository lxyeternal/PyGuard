  "purpose": "The code appears to set version information for a Python module or script.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to files, network, or other outputs from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines variables and joins strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata comments and straightforward version string construction; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard metadata comments, author info, and a simple tuple for version parts. It joins version components into a version string. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign snippet primarily used for versioning. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation are present.",
