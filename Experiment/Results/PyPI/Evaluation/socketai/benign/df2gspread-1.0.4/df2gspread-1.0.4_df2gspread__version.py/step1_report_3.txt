  "flows": "No data flows; only static variable assignment and string joining.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard metadata comments and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comment headers with author and date metadata, followed by a tuple defining version numbers. It joins the tuple elements into a string to form a version identifier. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, containing only static metadata definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
