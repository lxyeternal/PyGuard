{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project, specifically for the 'df2gspread' module, including dependencies, metadata, and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a file, reads README content, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no execution of untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script primarily loads static configuration data and executes a version file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec' to run contents of '_version.py', which could be risky if the version file contains malicious code. No other suspicious code or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from setuptools and reads version info from a file, executing its content with 'exec', which is a potential risk if the version file is malicious. It defines package dependencies, metadata, and configuration for package distribution. No input/output flows, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The code appears standard for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is typical package configuration code with a potential risk stemming from executing external version file content via 'exec'. However, no malicious intent, malware, or security threats are evident in its static analysis. The overall risk is very low, with only the 'exec' use being a minor concern if the version file is compromised.",
