{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'df2gspread' Python project, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'df2gspread/_version.py', reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; primarily reads files and executes code for version extraction.",
  "flows": "Reads version file -> executes content to define __version__ -> uses this info in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from a version file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with; no validation or sanitization of content. No other suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and dependencies for setup. The only noteworthy risky part is executing code from an external version file with 'exec', which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified. No other malicious behavior or obfuscated code present. No network connections, no handling of sensitive data, and no suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script with a potential security concern regarding the use of 'exec' on an external file for versioning. No evidence of malware or malicious intent detected beyond this, which is a common but slightly risky practice.",
