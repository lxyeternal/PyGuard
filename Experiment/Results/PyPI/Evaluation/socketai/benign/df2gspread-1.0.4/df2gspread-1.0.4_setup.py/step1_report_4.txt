{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to configure and set up a Python package for distribution, specifically for a package named 'df2gspread' that exports tables to Google Spreadsheets.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'df2gspread/_version.py', reads README file for long description, and reads package metadata including dependencies, URLs, and author info.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setuptools.setup()' function to process package metadata and dependencies, which are standard for package distribution. No untrusted data is directly written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README, then passes this data into 'setup()' for packaging; no data flows from untrusted sources into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically executes content of '_version.py' with 'exec()', which could be risky if that file contains malicious code. No other suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading version info, long description, and dependencies. The use of 'exec()' on a version file is a potential risk if the version file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The rest of the code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a potential minor security concern due to 'exec()' usage on a local version file. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
