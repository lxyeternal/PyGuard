  "purpose": "The setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'df2gspread' Python project, specifying dependencies, metadata, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'df2gspread/_version.py' and the README file.",
  "sinks": "Executes code from '_version.py' via exec(), which could run arbitrary code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reads '_version.py' content and executes it with exec(), then proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external version file; no network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard packaging script with a common pattern of dynamic version assignment using exec(). While exec() can pose security risks if the version file is malicious, in controlled environments, this pattern is typical. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the static analysis. The main concern is the exec() pattern, which is a known but low-risk practice when the source is trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The script is safe for use, with a minimal security concern regarding exec() on a local, controlled file. No malware or malicious activity is detected. To enhance security, consider replacing exec() with safer alternatives such as importing the version directly.",
