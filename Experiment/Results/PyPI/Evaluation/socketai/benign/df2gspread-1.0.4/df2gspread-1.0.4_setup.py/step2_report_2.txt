  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, reasoning flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the use of `exec()` to run code from the version file as a potential risk.\n- No reports mention any actual malicious activity, network connections, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores assigned are consistently low (around 0.2), which aligns with the minimal actual threat but acknowledges the `exec()` pattern as a minor security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The use of `exec()` on external files (`_version.py`) is a known pattern for dynamic versioning but can be risky if the version file is compromised. However, in controlled environments, this is a common practice.\n- No other security issues, such as hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data leaks, are present.\n\n### Flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports correctly identify the `exec()` pattern as a potential risk but do not overstate the threat; they correctly conclude that the overall risk is very low.\n- No assumptions are made about malicious intent beyond the `exec()` concern, which is appropriate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Around 0.2, reflecting the minor concern over `exec()` usage, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The use of `exec()` on a local, controlled version file is a known pattern but can be exploited if the file is tampered with. The reports correctly recognize this as a minor security concern but not malware.\n- No evidence of actual malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior justifies higher scores.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the static analysis findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — minor concern over `exec()`, but overall very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and cautious, correctly identifying the main concern (use of `exec()`) without overstating the threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No additional risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the static code analysis.",
