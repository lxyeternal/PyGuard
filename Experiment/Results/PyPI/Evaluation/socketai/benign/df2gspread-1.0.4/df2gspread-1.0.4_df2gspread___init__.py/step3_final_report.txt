  "purpose": "This code serves as a header comment containing metadata such as author, date, email, and modification details, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only comments with metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only comments with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments providing metadata about the script's author, creation date, email, and modification history. There are no functions, data flows, or executable statements. The absence of code eliminates the possibility of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The comments do not include any hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or suspicious patterns. Given the lack of executable content, the code cannot perform any malicious actions or pose security threats. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely metadata comments with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security risk, contains no obfuscation, and cannot be malicious. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
