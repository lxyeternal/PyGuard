  "purpose": "The script manages Google API credentials, including loading, validating, and creating credentials for accessing Google Drive and Sheets APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads credential files from the user's home directory (~/.gdrive_private, ~/.oauth/drive.json), and input parameters such as private_key_file and client_secret_file.",
  "sinks": "Uses credentials to interact with Google APIs, which could potentially access user data if misused. No direct data leaks or malicious system effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Reads credential files -> validates or creates credentials -> stores credentials -> returns credentials for API access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; credentials are loaded from user files. The code attempts to handle both installed app and service account credential formats. Uses deprecated class SignedJwtAssertionCredentials, which could be a concern but not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard credential handling for Google APIs, including loading from files, validating, and creating OAuth2 credentials or service account credentials. It uses well-known libraries and follows common practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The credential files are expected to be securely stored by the user. The only minor concern is the use of deprecated classes, which is not malicious but indicates outdated practice. No hardcoded secrets or covert behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical credential management utility for Google APIs, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles sensitive credentials carefully, relies on user-provided files, and does not perform any malicious actions.",
