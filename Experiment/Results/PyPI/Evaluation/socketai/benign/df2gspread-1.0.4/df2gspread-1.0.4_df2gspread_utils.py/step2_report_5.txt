  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code handles OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive and Sheets APIs.\n- They note that the code reads credentials from local files, creates credential objects, and stores tokens.\n- No report finds evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The use of deprecated classes (SignedJwtAssertionCredentials) is noted but considered a minor issue, not malicious.\n- The code handles sensitive data (private keys, tokens) but does so in a standard manner for such applications.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, with very low security risks (0.1–0.2), and high confidence levels (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a legitimate implementation of OAuth2 credential management, with no malicious actions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  Minor concerns are noted:\n  - Use of deprecated classes (`SignedJwtAssertionCredentials`).\n  - Hardcoded paths for credential files.\n  - Storage of sensitive credentials unencrypted.\n  These are security best practices issues but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious activity—no code exfiltration, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors—the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports report 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minor security concerns (outdated classes, credential storage practices). These are not malicious but could be improved.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The minor issues (use of deprecated classes, credential file handling) are security hygiene concerns, not indicators of malware.\n- The consistent low malware and obfuscated scores across reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (minor security hygiene issues, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No evidence of malicious code or behavior                                    |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | No obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected                              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2          | Minor security concerns (deprecated classes, credential storage practices) |\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for managing Google OAuth2 credentials, with no malicious intent or activity.",
