  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard credential management utility for Google APIs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to outdated practices and credential storage locations, but these are not malicious issues."
