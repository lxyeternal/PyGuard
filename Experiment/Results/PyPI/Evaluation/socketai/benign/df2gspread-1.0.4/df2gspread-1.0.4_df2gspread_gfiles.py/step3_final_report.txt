  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Google Drive files and Google Sheets worksheets, including file ID retrieval, worksheet access/creation, and file deletion.",
  "sources": "Credentials object for authorization, gfile path string, gfile ID, worksheet name, credentials for delete_file, and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Google Drive and Sheets services, which could potentially expose data if credentials are compromised, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "Authorization credentials -> API service build -> file/folder search or creation -> worksheet access or creation -> file deletion via API.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling in `delete_file` and `get_worksheet` functions, which could mask errors but are not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions with Google Drive and Sheets, using well-known libraries and methods. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Exception handling is broad but not malicious; it may mask errors but does not pose a security threat. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The overall design is straightforward and aligns with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, primarily due to broad exception handling which could affect robustness but not security. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0.2.",
