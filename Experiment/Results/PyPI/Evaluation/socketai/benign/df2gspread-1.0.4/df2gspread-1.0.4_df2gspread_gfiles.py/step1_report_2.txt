{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Google Drive and Google Sheets, including retrieving file IDs, accessing worksheets, and deleting files.",
  "sources": "Credentials used for authorization, gfile path input, and worksheet name input.",
  "targets": "Google Drive API and Google Sheets API calls that retrieve or modify data, and the deletion of files.",
  "flows": "Credentials are authorized to build API service objects. File paths are parsed to locate or create files/folders. Worksheet names are used to access or create sheets. Files can be deleted via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of broad exception catching (bare except) which could hide errors; no suspicious or malicious code patterns; API usage appears standard; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes Google APIs to manage files and sheets, with input parameters for credentials, file paths, and worksheet names. It employs standard API calls with proper authorization. The only noteworthy concern is the broad except clause in 'get_worksheet', which might mask errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors are present. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate cloud file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for Google Drive and Sheets interaction. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is error handling practices, but this does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe.",
