  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code appears to be standard Google API utility functions; no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Broad exception handling in `delete_file` could mask errors but is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Broad exception handling in `get_worksheet` (try-except without specific exception) could hide errors, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Similar broad exception handling, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity; standard API usage.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No obfuscation or suspicious code; potential concern if credentials are compromised, but not within this code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of broad exception handling and lack of input validation noted, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code functionality:** All reports correctly identify that the code interacts with Google APIs for file and worksheet management.\n- **Malware potential:** None of the reports find signs of malware or malicious intent. All assign malware scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are at 0.2, reflecting minor concerns mainly about broad exception handling, which is acceptable in this context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured utility functions for Google Drive and Sheets.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering potential error masking but not malicious intent.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the broad exception handling which could mask errors, but it does not elevate the security risk to a higher level.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
