{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs, including retrieving file IDs, creating worksheets, and deleting files.",
  "sources": "User-provided credentials, gfile path, worksheet name, file ID",
  "sinks": "Google Drive API calls (file retrieval, creation, deletion), potentially unsafe if credentials are compromised",
  "flows": "Credentials used to authorize API calls -> API requests to Google Drive/Sheets -> Actions such as get, create, delete files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network addresses; no unusual or malicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Google Drive and Sheets API interactions with proper use of authorization. The functions for file retrieval, creation, worksheet management, and deletion are implemented straightforwardly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The only potential concern could be if malicious actors gained access to credentials or misused the API functions, but the code itself does not contain malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical utility for managing Google Drive and Sheets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external credentials and user input, which are common in such scripts. No malicious activity is detected.",
