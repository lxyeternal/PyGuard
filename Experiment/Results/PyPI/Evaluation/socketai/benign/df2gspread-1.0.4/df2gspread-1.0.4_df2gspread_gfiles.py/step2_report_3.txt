  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard API interaction code for Google Drive and Sheets.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Broad exception handling in `delete_file` could mask errors but isn't malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk from API usage.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard API interactions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Same concern about broad exception handling in `get_worksheet`.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; error handling is a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard API usage.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Same as above regarding broad exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the code is a typical utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, standard API interactions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Same concern about broad exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard API usage.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Noted the broad exception handling and lack of input validation, which are common issues but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; the concerns are about robustness, not security.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is consistent. The code performs API interactions for file management, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports reflects minor security concerns (e.g., broad exception handling), which are acceptable in utility scripts but could be improved.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, well within typical utility scope, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual behavior.",
