  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The broad exception handling is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n- **Code verification:** The code performs typical API interactions for Google Drive and Sheets. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the risk is low due to reliance on external credentials.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API usage, no hardcoded secrets, and noting broad exception handling.\n\n- **Code verification:** Same as above; no malicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same conclusions—standard API interactions, no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, only broad exception handling.\n\n- **Code verification:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing legitimate API usage and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code verification:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same general conclusion—standard utility functions, no malicious code, with a note on broad exception handling and lack of input validation.\n\n- **Code verification:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The broad exception handling is a concern for robustness but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's straightforward, readable style.\n\n- **Risk score:** The scores are consistently low (0.2). Given the code's purpose and no malicious indicators, this seems reasonable. The only minor concern is broad exception handling, which could mask errors, but that doesn't significantly elevate the security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is justified; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable, considering the potential for error masking but no actual security threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to broad exception handling and reliance on external credentials, but overall low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the code's benign nature and minimal security concerns.",
