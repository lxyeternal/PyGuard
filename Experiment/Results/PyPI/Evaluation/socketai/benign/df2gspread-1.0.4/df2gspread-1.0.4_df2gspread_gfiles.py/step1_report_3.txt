{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with Google Drive and Google Sheets, including retrieving file IDs, accessing worksheets, and deleting files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as credentials, file paths, and worksheet names; also API responses from Google Drive and Sheets services.",
  "sinks": "Google API calls that perform file retrieval, creation, deletion, and worksheet access; potential exposure of file IDs or credentials if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Credentials are used to authorize API requests, which then perform operations like searching, creating, or deleting files based on provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; API usage appears standard. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns. No direct data leaks or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Google API client libraries for managing files and sheets. It properly handles authorization and API calls without evident malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions include typical API interactions for file management and worksheet handling, following expected patterns. The error handling in 'delete_file' only logs and raises exceptions. No input sanitization issues or insecure code practices are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Google Drive and Sheets via API. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Its security risks are minimal, primarily related to proper credential handling outside this code context.",
