  "purpose": "Download Google Spreadsheet data and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from Google Sheets via gspread API, obtaining credentials, and worksheet data.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into a DataFrame; no untrusted data flows to external systems or leaks.",
  "flows": "Credentials retrieval -> API authorization -> Worksheet data fetch -> Data processing into DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API authentication, data retrieval, and DataFrame creation with proper handling of parameters. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. The OAuth scope is broad but explicitly documented, representing a configuration concern rather than malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for downloading Google Sheets data into pandas DataFrames. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
