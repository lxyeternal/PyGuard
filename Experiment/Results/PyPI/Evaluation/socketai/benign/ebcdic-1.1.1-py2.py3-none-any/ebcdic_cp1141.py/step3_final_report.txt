{
  "purpose": "Provides encoding and decoding for the 'cp1141' character set using static character mapping tables.",
  "sources": "Static decoding_table array embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static tables are used for encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes through the codecs.charmap_decode to Unicode characters, and from Unicode characters through codecs.charmap_encode to bytes, solely via static tables.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling; code is auto-generated static mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Python codec with static character tables, API classes, and a registration function. It contains no malicious logic, external data processing, or network activity. The tables are hardcoded, and the code relies on standard 'codecs' APIs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The static nature and the absence of runtime data handling indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated character encoding module with static tables. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.",
