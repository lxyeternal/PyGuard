{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec ('cp1141') for use in Python, including encoding and decoding functions, stream support, and the character mapping tables.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own embedded decoding_table and encoding_table for character mappings; no external inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output; the code mainly provides static data structures and codec API implementations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves converting data between encoded bytes and Unicode characters via the character tables; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The tables are static mappings, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or environment variable use.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard codecs interface with predefined character mappings, using static tables for encoding and decoding. There is no dynamic input handling, network access, or file I/O. The tables contain typical character mappings with no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications. The structure adheres to normal Python codec definitions. The only notable aspect is the presence of a large static decoding table; however, it appears to be a standard character set implementation. No malicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a character encoding codec ('cp1141') with static character mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code.",
