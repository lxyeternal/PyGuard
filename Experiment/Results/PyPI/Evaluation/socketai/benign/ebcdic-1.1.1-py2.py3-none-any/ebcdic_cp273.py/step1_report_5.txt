{
  "purpose": "This code defines a character encoding and decoding table for the 'cp273' encoding, providing codec API implementations for encoding and decoding text data using this character set.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the 'decoding_table' string which defines the character mappings. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code that handle untrusted data; the code primarily provides static mappings and standard codec API functions.",
  "flows": "The encoding functions convert text to bytes using the encoding table; the decoding functions convert bytes to text using the decoding table. No external untrusted data flows into these functions in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a generated codec definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated character encoding module for 'cp273', containing a static decoding table and associated API functions for encoding and decoding. The code utilizes standard Python 'codecs' API patterns. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of a static, hardcoded character mapping table is typical for encoding modules. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling routines are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, autogenerated codec implementation defining character mappings for 'cp273'. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and purely functional for encoding and decoding character data.",
