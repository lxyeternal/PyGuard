  "purpose": "Define a character mapping codec for cp273 encoding/decoding in Python.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table string containing character mappings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Decoding_table maps byte values to characters; encoding_table maps characters back to byte values.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard character mapping implementation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions are present. No network, file, or environment interactions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom codec for cp273 encoding/decoding, based solely on static character mapping tables. It imports only standard libraries (codecs, future), implements standard Codec classes, and provides a getregentry function for registering the codec. The decoding_table and encoding_table are static mappings with no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behaviors. No data leakage, injection, or malicious operations are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a character set codec.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard character mapping codec implementation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward, static mapping without external data interactions or dynamic behavior.",
