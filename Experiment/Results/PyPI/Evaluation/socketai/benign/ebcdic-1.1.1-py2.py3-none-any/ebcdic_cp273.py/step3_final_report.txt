  "purpose": "Implement a character encoding/decoding codec for 'cp273' using static character mapping tables.",
  "sources": "Decoding table string, external file 'temp/cp273.txt' (used for code generation)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static tables do not process external input",
  "flows": "Static mapping from byte values to Unicode characters; no dynamic data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, generated static data, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Python codec for 'cp273' with static character tables, classes, and registration functions. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or external data handling. The tables are hardcoded, generated from an external source, typical for such codecs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code adheres to Python's codecs API and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static implementation of a character set codec with no malicious intent or security risks. It is generated from an external source and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with its benign nature.",
