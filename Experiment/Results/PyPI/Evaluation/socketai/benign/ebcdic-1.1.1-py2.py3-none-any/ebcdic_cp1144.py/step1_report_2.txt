{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec 'cp1144' for use in Python, including encode/decode functions and tables.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; static data in the form of encoding/decoding tables.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code converts between Unicode and byte representations via predefined tables, with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a standard codec implementation generated from a text file, with no obfuscation or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard character encoding codec, including encoding and decoding tables, using 'codecs' library APIs. The decoding table is a static string with character mappings, and the encoding table is built from it. There are no input/output operations, network activities, or suspicious logic. All functions and tables are typical for a custom encoding. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are detected. The code appears to be auto-generated for character set support, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated Python codec module for character encoding, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply defines a character mapping table for encoding/decoding purposes.",
