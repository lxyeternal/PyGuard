{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom character encoding/decoding for cp1144, enabling conversion between byte data and Unicode strings using specified mapping tables.",
  "sources": "The primary data source is the 'decoding_table' string which provides the character mappings; no external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely initializes encoding/decoding tables and defines codec classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard codec implementation generated from a character mapping file without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and defines classes for encoding and decoding using character maps. The decoding table is a static string mapping byte values to Unicode characters, and the encoding table is generated from it. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is consistent with standard Python codec modules. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. All data appears to be static mapping tables, likely generated from a character encoding specification. The code is straightforward and intended for character encoding conversions, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a character encoding codec for cp1144, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for character mapping purposes, generated from a source file. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
