  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a character encoding codec with static tables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal risk score reflecting the static, generated nature but not indicating any threat."
