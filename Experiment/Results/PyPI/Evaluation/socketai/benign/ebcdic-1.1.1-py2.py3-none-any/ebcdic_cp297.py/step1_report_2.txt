{
  "purpose": "Define a character encoding codec 'cp297' for Python, enabling encoding and decoding of text using a specified character mapping.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static encoding and decoding tables within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code does not process external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code maps input text through the encoding/decoding tables internally; no external data flows or malicious commands are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code solely implements character mapping tables.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a character encoding 'cp297' by providing static decoding and encoding tables. It implements standard codecs API classes for encoding, decoding, incremental processing, and stream I/O, following the typical pattern for Python codecs modules. The decoding table contains mappings of byte values to Unicode characters, and the encoding table is generated from the decoding table via 'codecs.charmap_build'. There are no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution components. The code does not perform any file operations, network communication, or command execution, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. The entire implementation is static and straightforward, consistent with standard Python codec definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static implementation of a character encoding codec without any malicious intent. It provides a character mapping for 'cp297' and adheres to expected design patterns. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified.",
