{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom character encoding 'cp297' for Python, providing encode and decode functions based on a specified character mapping table.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encoding table, which is a static string of character mappings, and the getregentry() function which returns encoding registration info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit input or output sinks that handle untrusted data, such as network, filesystem, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only provides static data and registration functions for the codec.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the decoding table is a static, hardcoded string with standard character mappings. No obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a standard character encoding codec using Python's codecs module, with a static decoding table and an encoding table built from it. The code is straightforward, defining encode/decode methods, registration functions, and character mappings. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. The purpose appears to be creating a custom character encoding. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a character encoding codec with static data. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The design is standard for such codecs and poses no security risk.",
