{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom character encoding 'cp297' for encoding and decoding text data, mainly used for text processing or data transformation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encoding table and decoding table data embedded within the script; no external data sources or inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, networks, or files; it only provides encoding/decoding functionalities based on predefined tables.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is static from the defined tables to encoding/decoding functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code solely implements a character mapping codec using standard Python 'codecs' API with static tables.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a custom codec class with encode/decode methods using a static character mapping table. The tables are hardcoded, and the implementation leverages Python's standard 'codecs' module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external resource access occurs. The code appears to be a standard, autogenerated character map codec without any malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, autogenerated character encoding module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It purely implements a static character mapping for encoding and decoding. There are no suspicious code patterns, external interactions, or obfuscation indicators.",
