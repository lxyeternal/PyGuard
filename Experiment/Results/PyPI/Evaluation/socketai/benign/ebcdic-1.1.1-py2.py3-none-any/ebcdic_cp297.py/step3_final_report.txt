  "purpose": "Implement a custom character encoding codec for Python based on a static character mapping table.",
  "sources": "The static decoding_table which contains character mappings, generated from 'temp/cp297.txt'.",
  "sinks": "The encode and decode functions that process text and data using the static tables.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into encode/decode functions, which utilize the character mapping tables to produce encoded or decoded output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward static implementation with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static decoding table and constructs an encoding table from it, then implements standard Python codec classes and API registration. It contains no dynamic or external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the static, benign nature of the implementation. The code is generated from a text source and used solely for character mapping, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static character encoding codec with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
