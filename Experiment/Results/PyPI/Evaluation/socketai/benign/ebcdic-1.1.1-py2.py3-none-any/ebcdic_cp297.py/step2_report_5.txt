  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a benign, standard implementation of a character encoding codec with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code. It correctly identifies that the implementation is static, based on a character mapping table, with no external data flows or dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1). This seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is a static, autogenerated character map codec with no external input or malicious logic. It correctly notes the absence of obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review confirms the code is a benign, static implementation of a character mapping codec, with no external data handling or suspicious features.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with previous ones, describing the code as a straightforward, static character encoding implementation, with no malicious features.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report highlights that the code is a standard static character encoding codec, with no malicious or suspicious features, no obfuscation, and no dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description of a static, character mapping codec. No signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or external data fetching.\n\n- **Malware potential:** None detected across all reports. The code is purely data-driven with static tables.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation features or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and generated from a text source.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, static implementation of a character encoding codec with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be an autogenerated, standard character map for Python's codecs system, with no security risks.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.",
