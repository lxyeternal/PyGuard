{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec 'cp297' for encoding and decoding data using specified character mappings.",
  "sources": "Decoding table string containing character mappings; getregentry() function providing codec registration info.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data sinks like network connections or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is mapped via charmap_decode to characters; encoding uses charmap_encode with encoding_table derived from decoding_table.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to be a standard codec implementation. The decoding table and encoding table are consistent, generated from a text source.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a character set codec following Python's codecs API. It loads a decoding table with character mappings, constructs an encoding table, and exposes registration through getregentry(). The process is typical for a custom codec. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no unusual variables are detected. The file appears to be a standard, straightforward codec definition based on a character mapping source file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of a character encoding codec without any malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or a supply chain threat.",
