{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec 'cp285' for use in Python, providing encode/decode functions and tables.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code primarily defines static tables and functions. No external data reading or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output, network, or file writing functions; code is purely defining data tables and codec APIs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable sinks; the code only sets up static encoding/decoding tables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code behaviors, or obfuscated code present. The decoding and encoding tables are standard for character encoding definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom character encoding codec with predefined static tables for encoding and decoding characters. It contains typical methods for encoding and decoding data using the tables, along with standard API functions for integration with Python's codecs module. The decoding table appears to be a comprehensive mapping for the 'cp285' encoding, with no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The tables are static and standard for encoding definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a character encoding codec with static tables, no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no external data handling. It does not pose a security threat or malicious behavior risk.",
