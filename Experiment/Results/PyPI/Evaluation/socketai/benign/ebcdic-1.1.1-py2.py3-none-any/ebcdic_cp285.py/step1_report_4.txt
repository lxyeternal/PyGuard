{
  "purpose": "Define a custom character encoding 'cp285' for encoding and decoding text data according to a specific character mapping.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table variable, which contains the character mapping; getregentry() function, which registers the codec.",
  "sinks": "The encode() and decode() methods that transform data; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The encode() and decode() methods use the decoding_table and encoding_table to convert data; no external or untrusted input handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; standard charset mappings are used. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard custom character encoding, with clear, explicit character tables. It imports the 'codecs' module, defines encoding and decoding functions, and registers the codec via getregentry(). No external data sources or sinks are present. The character tables appear to be static mappings without any hidden or malicious payloads. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The purpose appears to be providing encoding support for a specific charset, consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a character encoding codec with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured character mapping module with no suspicious features.",
