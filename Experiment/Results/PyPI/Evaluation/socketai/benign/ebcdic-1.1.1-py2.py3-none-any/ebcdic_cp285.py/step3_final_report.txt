{
  "purpose": "This code implements a static Python codec for the 'cp285' character set, providing encoding and decoding functionalities based on predefined character mappings.",
  "sources": "The decoding table and the encoding table generated from it; no external data sources or input handling beyond static tables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output beyond standard encoding/decoding functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings through encode/decode functions to output byte sequences or strings, using static character tables with no dynamic or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, static implementation of character mappings with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static character mapping for 'cp285', with classes for encoding/decoding and registration via getregentry(). The decoding table is a fixed string of characters, matching the standard charset. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The implementation adheres to Python's codecs API and is generated from a text file, indicating it is a benign, static charset mapping. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static implementation of a Python character encoding codec for 'cp285'. It contains no malicious or suspicious features, and the assigned security scores are appropriate. It poses no security risk in its current form.",
