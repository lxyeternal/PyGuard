  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python codec implementation for 'cp285' character set.\n- The decoding table appears to be a static, legitimate character mapping.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code is static, generated from a text file, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely encoding/decoding, with no malicious intent indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code appears correct and standard for defining a character encoding. No anomalies, errors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 or very close to zero, consistent with benign static charset mapping.\n\n- **Scores consistency?**  \n  The scores are generally aligned with the findings: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk very low, confidence high.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as static, standard, and free of suspicious behaviors. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of charset mapping.\n\n- **Any suspicious entries?**  \n  No. The tables contain standard character mappings for cp285, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The overall assessment in all reports is consistent and justified.\n- The risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- Malware scores of 0 are correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated=0 is justified; the code is straightforward and generated from a text file.\n- The security risk is minimal, primarily because the code could be misused if embedded maliciously elsewhere, but in this isolated context, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, standard charset implementation)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No dynamic or external code execution.  \n- No network or external dependencies.  \n- Static character mapping tables.  \n- No signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a legitimate, static Python charset implementation with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0, confidence=1.0 for this code.  \n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.",
