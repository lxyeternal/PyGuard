  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec for cp870 based on a specified character mapping table.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table string which contains the character mappings; getregentry() function providing codec registration info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The decoding_table is used to build the encoding_table; the codec classes facilitate encoding and decoding using these tables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is a standard charset mapping implementation. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Python character encoding codec using a predefined character mapping table. It includes the necessary API classes and a registration function. The decoding table appears to be a legitimate character map, with no embedded malicious code, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is typical for a custom codec and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate character encoding codec implementation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply provides character translation functionality based on a static mapping table.",
