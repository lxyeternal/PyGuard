{
  "purpose": "Define a custom character encoding codec for 'cp500' to convert between byte data and Unicode strings.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table provides mappings from byte values to Unicode characters, and getregentry() function provides the codec registration details.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the codec encodes/decodes data but does not process untrusted input directly or perform actions with side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes through decode() to Unicode characters, and from Unicode strings through encode() to bytes, via the character mapping tables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious instructions. The code simply defines a character mapping codec based on a static table.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a character encoding codec for 'cp500', using static lookup tables for decoding and encoding. It includes standard API functions and classes for codecs. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The decoding_table and encoding_table are static, derived from a file, and used purely for character mapping. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or privacy-invasive behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a character encoding codec with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply maps characters for encoding/decoding purposes without side effects or external dependencies. The overall security risk score is very low.",
