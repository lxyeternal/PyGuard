{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Python character encoding 'cp1123' by creating encoding and decoding tables, along with necessary API functions for Python's codecs module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encoding and decoding tables embedded as string constants, particularly the 'decoding_table' string containing character mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily involves encoding and decoding operations with static tables; there are no direct sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading data (source) for encoding/decoding using static tables, converting characters as per the mapping tables, and providing API functions for use by Python's codec system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The encoding table includes Cyrillic characters and standard ASCII symbols. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code paths are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements a character encoding codec with predefined static tables for encoding and decoding. It adheres to standard Python codecs API, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The inclusion of Cyrillic characters and symbols appears to be purposeful for specific encoding needs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks, are evident. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for custom codecs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom character encoding codec with static tables. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to be intended for encoding/decoding data in a specific character set, with no suspicious signals.",
