The only potential concern is the presence of '\\x9f' at 0xFF, which is noted as 'APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND' but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious network or system calls, backdoors, or obfuscated code features are detected.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is a straightforward implementation of a character encoding codec, with standard API functions, static mapping tables, and no dynamic or external dependencies. The decoding_table maps byte values (0x00 to 0xFF) to Unicode characters, including Cyrillic characters, Latin symbols, and control characters. The encode() function is generated via codecs.charmap_build, which creates a reversible mapping. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior. All data is static and self-contained. The code appears to be a legitimate codec implementation for a specific character set.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard implementation of a character encoding codec with static mappings and no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond the normal scope of character encoding definitions. It is safe to use from a security perspective.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
