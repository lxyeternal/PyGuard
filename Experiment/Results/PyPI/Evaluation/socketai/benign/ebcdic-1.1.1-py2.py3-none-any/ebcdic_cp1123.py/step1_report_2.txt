{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Python codec 'cp1123' for encoding and decoding text using a specific character mapping table.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines encoding and decoding tables within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code simply provides encoding/decoding functions based on predefined tables.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a generated character mapping codec with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. No backdoors, code injection, or malicious code patterns are present. No network or system manipulation occurs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a character mapping for encoding and decoding, utilizing a 'decoding_table' and constructing an 'encoding_table'. The tables include standard ASCII, Cyrillic characters, and some special symbols, all hardcoded. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The module provides standard codec API functions to integrate with Python's codecs system. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The purpose is purely to facilitate text encoding/decoding with a specific character set.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, generated character mapping codec with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or transmit untrusted data, nor does it perform any harmful actions. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators.",
