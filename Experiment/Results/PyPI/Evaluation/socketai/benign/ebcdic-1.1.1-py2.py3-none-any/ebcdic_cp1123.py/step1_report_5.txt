No dynamic execution, network activity, or hidden commands are present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is a standard character encoding implementation for 'cp1123', generated from a text file, with no external data input or suspicious behavior. It defines encoding and decoding tables and API functions for the codecs module. The decoding table contains characters mapped to Cyrillic and Latin characters, which appears consistent with character set mapping. The absence of runtime data processing, network operations, or malicious code indicates no security concerns. The inclusion of a potentially suspicious control code '\\x9f' at the end does not suggest malicious intent but could be a placeholder or a control character, typical in encoding tables.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a benign, standard character encoding module with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply provides character mapping tables and API functions for encoding and decoding text data. No malicious or suspicious activities are present.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
