  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static character encoding module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The inclusion of control characters like '\\x9f' is typical for encoding tables and does not pose a threat. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
