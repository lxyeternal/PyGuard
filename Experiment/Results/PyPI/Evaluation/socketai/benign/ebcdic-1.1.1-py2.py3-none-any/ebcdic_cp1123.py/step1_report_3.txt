No external input or data reading sources are present.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"There are no apparent sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points within the code.\",\n  \"flows\": \"The flow involves encoding and decoding functions utilizing the character tables. No external data flows are evident outside the encoding/decoding process.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code is straightforward and generated from a text file, likely automatically, with no suspicious patterns or dynamic code execution. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of the application program command character ('\\x9f'), but this alone is not malicious.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script defines a custom character encoding 'cp1123' with an explicit decoding table and builds an encoding table from it. It provides classes and a getregentry() function conforming to Python's codecs module API. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no data leakage mechanisms. The use of character tables and encoding logic appears standard and static. The presence of characters like '\\x9f' (application program command) is normal in encoding tables and not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be an auto-generated, standard codec implementation without malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a legitimate, auto-generated character encoding codec definition with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It does not contain obfuscation, external malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
