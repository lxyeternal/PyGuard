{
  "purpose": "Define a custom character encoding codec 'cp1142' for encoding and decoding text based on a specific character mapping table.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it primarily defines static data structures (decoding_table and encoding_table) and functions/classes for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any operations that send data over networks, execute system commands, or handle untrusted inputs that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The encoding and decoding functions convert between text and byte data using predefined tables; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code consists of standard codec implementation and static character tables.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a character encoding/decoding class for 'cp1142' using a static decoding table and a built encoding table. It adheres to standard Python codec API patterns, with no external data handling, network activity, or system command execution. The static tables appear to be a character set mapping, generated from a text file, with no embedded secrets or malicious payloads. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware, and the code does not perform any operations that could harm or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a character encoding codec with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a generated mapping for character translation without any malicious or suspicious features.",
