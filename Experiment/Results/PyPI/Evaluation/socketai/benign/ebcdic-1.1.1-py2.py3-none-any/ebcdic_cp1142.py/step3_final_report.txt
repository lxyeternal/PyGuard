{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Python character encoding 'cp1142' with static character mapping tables for encoding and decoding.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table string containing character mappings, generated from 'temp/cp1142.txt'; the encoding_table generated via codecs.charmap_build from the decoding_table.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or output data, nor does it perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Static character mappings are used directly in encoding and decoding functions; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and generated from an external source without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static character encoding codec with predefined tables, using standard Python codecs API classes. The decoding table is a large string with character mappings, generated externally. The encoding table is built from this decoding table. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static implementation of a custom character encoding codec with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
