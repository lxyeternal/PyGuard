{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding codec 'cp1142' for use with Python's codecs module.",
  "sources": "The decoding table is hardcoded within the script; no external data sources or input reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines encoding/decoding functions and tables.",
  "flows": "The encode/decode functions directly use the static tables; no dynamic or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code or misleading variable names. The decoding table appears to be a static mapping of character codes.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a character encoding codec 'cp1142' with static encoding and decoding tables. It uses standard codecs APIs and builds encoding tables from the decoding table. No external input, no network operations, and no execution of untrusted data are present. All data and functions are static, straightforward, and consistent with standard codec definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code does not perform any harmful actions; it merely maps character codes for encoding/decoding purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a custom character encoding codec. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious data flows, or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, static codec definition without security risks.",
