  "purpose": "Define a character encoding codec 'cp1142' for Python to handle specific character mappings based on a custom decoding table.",
  "sources": "The code reads the decoding table string to construct the encoding table using codecs.charmap_build.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted input data or network communication; the code primarily defines static data structures and functions.",
  "flows": "The decoding table is used to generate an encoding table. No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code's main flow is static data initialization and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is a standard implementation of a custom character codec with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a custom character encoding codec named 'cp1142' by defining a decoding table with character mappings. It uses standard Python codecs APIs and constructs an encoding table from the decoding table with 'codecs.charmap_build'. The code includes classes for encoding, decoding, and stream handling, all typical for custom codecs. There are no suspicious data flows, external data sources, or network operations. The code is purely static and appears to be generated from a text file 'temp/cp1142.txt', indicating a legitimate purpose of defining character mappings. No hardcoded credentials, secret tokens, or backdoors are present. The only data is static tables and class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a custom character encoding codec. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to provide character mapping based on predefined tables. Overall, it is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
