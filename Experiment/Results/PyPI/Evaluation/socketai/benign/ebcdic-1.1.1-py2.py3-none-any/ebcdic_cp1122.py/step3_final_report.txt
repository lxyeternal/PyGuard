{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom character encoding 'cp1122' for Python's codecs module, using static character mapping tables.",
  "sources": "Static decoding_table and encoding_table; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely static data used internally for encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Static tables used by codecs to map byte values to Unicode characters and vice versa; no data flow outside the module.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static character mapping with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated static character encoding module with classes for encoding and decoding, registration via getregentry(), and large static tables. No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The implementation follows standard patterns for Python codecs. All signals indicate benign, static, generated code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static character encoding implementation with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves solely for character mapping purposes and does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data.",
