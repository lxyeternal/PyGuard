{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom character encoding codec 'cp1122' for use in Python, providing encode and decode functionality along with support for incremental and stream-based encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "The decoding_table string, which contains mappings of byte values to Unicode characters, is a hardcoded data source. No external inputs or data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "The encode function outputs encoded byte sequences; the decode function outputs Unicode strings. No untrusted data sinks such as network connections or file writes are directly involved here.",
  "flows": "The primary data flow involves converting byte data to Unicode via decode (from decoding_table) and converting Unicode to bytes via encode (using the encoding_table). There are no external input or output flows that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a character mapping codec with no unusual code structures, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the codecs module, defines codec classes for encoding and decoding using a hardcoded character mapping table, and provides a getregentry() function for registering the codec. The decoding table is a static string mapping byte values to Unicode characters, and the encoding table is generated from it via codecs.charmap_build. There are no input/output operations, external data dependencies, or dynamic code execution. The implementation appears standard and consistent with Python’s codec extension patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom character encoding codec with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It solely provides character mapping functionality without external interactions or hidden behaviors.",
