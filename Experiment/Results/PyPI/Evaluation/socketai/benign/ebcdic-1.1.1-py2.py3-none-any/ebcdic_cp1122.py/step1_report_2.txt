{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Python character encoding codec named 'cp1122' based on a character mapping table for encoding and decoding text data.",
  "sources": "The encoding_table generated from decoding_table, which maps byte values to Unicode characters; the getregentry() function providing codec registration info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network, file I/O, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Input text is converted to encoded byte sequences via Codec.encode() which uses encoding_table; byte data is decoded via Codec.decode() using decoding_table.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed. The code appears to be a standard character encoding definition generated from a character map file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Python codecs module for a custom character encoding 'cp1122'. It contains classes for encoding/decoding, incremental encoding/decoding, and stream I/O, all standard and derived from 'codecs.Codec'. The getregentry() function registers the codec. The decoding_table maps byte values (0x00 to 0xFF) to Unicode characters, and the encoding_table is built from this mapping. There are no external inputs, network connections, or file manipulations; the code is static. It appears to be automatically generated from a character map file ('temp/cp1122.txt') with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom character encoding codec for Python, generated from a character map file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical codec registration script with no external dependencies or suspicious patterns.",
