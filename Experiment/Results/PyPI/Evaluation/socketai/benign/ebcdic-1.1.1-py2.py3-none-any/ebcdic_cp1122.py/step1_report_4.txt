{
  "purpose": "Define a custom character encoding codec 'cp1122' for use in Python, providing encode/decode functions and tables.",
  "sources": "The code imports standard libraries (codecs) and defines tables and classes within the module; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data processing or data leaks are evident; no network, file, or environment variable access is present.",
  "flows": "The encode and decode functions use the defined tables; data flows from input through encoding/decoding functions to output, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard charset mapping implementation generated from a text file, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The tables contain normal character mappings; no signs of malicious manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a character encoding 'cp1122' through a standard approach using Python's codecs module. It constructs a decoding table mapping byte values to Unicode characters, and builds an encoding table from it. No external input, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be generated by a script ('gencodec.py') for charset mapping purposes. All functions and classes are standard and used as intended for character encoding/decoding. There are no suspicious functions, data flows, or unusual code constructs. The purpose is purely to support character encoding, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard character encoding implementation, generated from a charset text file, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs character mapping as intended without any suspicious features.",
