  "sinks": "None explicitly; only importing exceptions, no data processing or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import statements importing exception classes from an external module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with no unusual code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports several exception classes from an external module 'squarelet.exceptions' to define custom exceptions for use in python-documentcloud. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a setup or configuration snippet for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for exception classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
