  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the python-documentcloud library by re-exporting exceptions from the squarelet.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from squarelet.exceptions module",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code only imports and re-exports exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; the code solely re-exports existing exceptions without any logic or data manipulation",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from the squarelet.exceptions module and assigns them to local names, primarily for use in the larger project. There is no dynamic execution, data processing, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to serve as a simple aliasing or re-export layer to facilitate exception handling in other parts of the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves only as an aliasing layer for exception classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
