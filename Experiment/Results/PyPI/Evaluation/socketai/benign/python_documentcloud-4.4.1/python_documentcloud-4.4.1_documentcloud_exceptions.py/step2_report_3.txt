  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and if the scoring reflects the actual risk.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a simple set of import statements that re-export exception classes from an external library ('squarelet.exceptions').\n- There are no signs of data processing, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just importing exceptions from an external library and aliasing them. No issues like code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and detect no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0 or 0.0, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or 0.0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the code's benign import statements.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The code is straightforward, performing only import and aliasing of exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
