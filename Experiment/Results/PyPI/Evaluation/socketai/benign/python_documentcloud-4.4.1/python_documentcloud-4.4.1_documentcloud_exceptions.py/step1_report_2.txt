  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the python-documentcloud package by importing them from an external library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'squarelet.exceptions'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leak points; the code only performs imports",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only imports exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from an external library 'squarelet.exceptions' and aliases one of them. It serves as a module to standardize exception handling within the package. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing flows. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for exception import modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended to provide custom exceptions for the package.",
