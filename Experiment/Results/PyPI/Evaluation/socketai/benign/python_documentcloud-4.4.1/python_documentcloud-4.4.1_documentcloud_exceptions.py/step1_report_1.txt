  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the python-documentcloud package by importing exceptions from an external library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing exceptions from 'squarelet.exceptions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Import source from 'squarelet.exceptions' to local exception aliases; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code simply re-exports exceptions from an external library without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from the 'squarelet.exceptions' module and assigns one alias. It does not include any input processing, data handling, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be defining custom exceptions or aliases for use elsewhere in the package. The file is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement setup for exception handling. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected.",
