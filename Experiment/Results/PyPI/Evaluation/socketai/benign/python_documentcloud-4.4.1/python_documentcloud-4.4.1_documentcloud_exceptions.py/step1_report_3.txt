  "purpose": "Define custom exception aliases for the python-documentcloud package by importing exceptions from the squarelet library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from squarelet.exceptions",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; mainly aliasing exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports exception classes from a third-party library and creates aliases for use within the module. There is no dynamic execution, user input processing, or network activity. It acts as a simple re-export or aliasing mechanism without any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import and alias exception classes for internal use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
