{
  "purpose": "This code imports exception classes from an external module ('squarelet.exceptions') and assigns an alias to one of them, serving to define custom exception handling for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'squarelet.exceptions' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from source to sink occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and aliasing with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that bring in exception classes from an external library and assign an alias to one of them. There is no data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to set up exception aliases for use elsewhere. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a standard pattern for exception handling setup, with high confidence that it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple import and aliasing of exception classes without any malicious or suspicious activity. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
