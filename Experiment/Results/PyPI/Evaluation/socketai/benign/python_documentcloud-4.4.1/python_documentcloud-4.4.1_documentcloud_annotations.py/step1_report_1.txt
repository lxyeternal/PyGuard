  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for creating and managing annotations (notes) on documents, including handling location calculations and API interactions.",
  "sources": "User input parameters such as title, page_number, content, access, and coordinate values (x1, y1, x2, y2); data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "API POST request to create a new annotation; response.json() used to instantiate Annotation objects.",
  "flows": "User parameters -> create() method -> data dictionary -> API POST request -> response.json() -> merge_dicts() -> Annotation instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of untrusted data is limited to API request/response. Coordinates validation is straightforward. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles user input parameters, validating coordinate ranges and ensuring all or none of the coordinate values are provided. API interactions use standard POST requests with JSON payloads, and response data is merged to instantiate objects. No suspicious code, hidden data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard annotation management functions without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation for managing document annotations with proper validation and API interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
