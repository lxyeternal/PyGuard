  "purpose": "Define classes for Organization data model and API client for interacting with organization resources",
  "sources": "Import from local module .base, class attribute definitions, __str__ method",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class attributes and __str__ method do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Organization and OrganizationClient, inheriting from base classes, with straightforward attribute assignments and a simple __str__ method. No input reading, no data processing, and no external communication are present. The code appears to be standard model and client class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition for representing organizations and a client to interact with such entities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
