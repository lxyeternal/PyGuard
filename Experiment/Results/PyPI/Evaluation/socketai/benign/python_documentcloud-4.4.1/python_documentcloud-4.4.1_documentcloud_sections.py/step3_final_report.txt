  "purpose": "API client classes for managing document sections, enabling creation and retrieval via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'title' and 'page_number' in create(); response JSON from API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data used to instantiate objects; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> POST request -> API response -> merge response JSON with existing data -> instantiate Section object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. External functions and properties are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward classes for API interactions, constructing JSON payloads from input parameters, sending POST requests, and processing responses. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The data flow is typical for API wrappers, with no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The reports uniformly recognize the code as standard, assigning zero malware scores and low security risks, consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for managing document sections. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-critical issues are present based on this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
