  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP requests, URL validation, ID processing, data grouping, and dictionary merging.",
  "sources": "The get_id() function reads input IDs; is_url() reads URL strings; requests_retry_session() creates HTTP sessions; other functions process data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data leading to security impacts; functions mainly process data internally without executing or storing untrusted data into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (IDs, URLs) flows through validation and processing functions, but no data flows into dangerous sinks like code execution, file manipulation, or network exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code follows standard patterns without obfuscation or unusual constructs. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or similar functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: requests_retry_session() sets up an HTTP session with retries, which is a standard pattern; get_id() processes ID strings to handle different formats; is_url() validates URLs; grouper() chunks iterables; merge_dicts() merges dictionaries. All functions are straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections outside intended use, and no obfuscation. The code appears benign and intended for standard use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for network requests, URL validation, ID processing, data grouping, and dictionary merging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
