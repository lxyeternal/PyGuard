{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for HTTP requests, URL validation, ID parsing, data chunking, and dictionary merging.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings passed to is_url(), IDs passed to get_id(), and iterable inputs to grouper().",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.Session() for HTTP requests, which could be a sink if URL or request data is untrusted, but no direct data leakage or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "flows": "Input URL or ID flows through validation or parsing functions; HTTP requests may utilize a session with retries, but no user data is directly sent or received in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Functions are standard utility implementations with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions: requests_retry_session() for reliable HTTP requests with retries, get_id() for parsing ID formats, is_url() for URL validation, grouper() for batching iterables, and merge_dicts() for combining dictionaries. No external data is hardcoded, no suspicious network activity, and no code indicates malicious intent. Usage of third-party libraries like requests and urllib3 is typical and safe. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and serve common utility purposes without malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any backdoors, malicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets. Overall, it is safe and unlikely to be malicious.",
