{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for HTTP requests with retries, URL validation, ID parsing, data grouping, and dictionary merging.",
  "sources": "Input data includes URLs for validation (`is_url`), IDs for parsing (`get_id`), and iterable data for grouping (`grouper`).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as system commands, file writes, or network transmissions are present. External requests are made via the `requests` library but are safely encapsulated in a session with retries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions (`get_id`, `is_url`, `grouper`, `merge_dicts`) through internal processing with no external data exfiltration or malicious use. The `requests_retry_session` manages HTTP requests but does not perform or initiate any data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. All functions perform standard utility tasks without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions commonly used in web-related applications. The `requests_retry_session` sets up a resilient HTTP session with retries, which is standard practice. The `get_id` function parses IDs with flexible formats, the `is_url` function validates URLs, `grouper` chunks data into fixed sizes, and `merge_dicts` combines multiple dictionaries. All functions follow safe coding practices with no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious data handling, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The code appears intended for legitimate purposes, with no external data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and suitable for integration into larger projects. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security threats are present.",
