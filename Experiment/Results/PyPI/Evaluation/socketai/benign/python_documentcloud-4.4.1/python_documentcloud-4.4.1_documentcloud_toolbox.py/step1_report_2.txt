  "purpose": "Utility functions for making HTTP requests with retries, parsing IDs, validating URLs, grouping iterables, and merging dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Requests for HTTP sessions, URL parsing via urlparse, input parameters for functions such as id_ and url, iterables in grouper and merge_dicts.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests in requests_retry_session, URL validation in is_url, data processing in grouper and merge_dicts.",
  "flows": "Requests created and potentially used in network communication, URL validation for untrusted inputs, data grouped or merged for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. All functions perform standard operations; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that handle HTTP request retries, ID parsing, URL validation, iterable grouping, and dictionary merging. These are common, benign operations with no signs of malicious intent. The requests_retry_session function includes a standard retry logic, and no data leakage, secret handling, or system compromise code is present. The URL validation function is straightforward. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are detected. The overall structure is typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs standard utility functions without any suspicious or harmful operations. The malware score is 0, security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
