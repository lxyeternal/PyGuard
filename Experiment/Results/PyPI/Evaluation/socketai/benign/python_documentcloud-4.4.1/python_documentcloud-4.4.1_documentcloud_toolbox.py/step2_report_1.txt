  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The functions are standard utilities, and no external network activity or secrets are involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's nature, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The securityRisk is low but not zero, possibly due to the network-related functions, but no evidence of malicious behavior exists.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard, safe nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Completely benign utility functions. The securityRisk being zero is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard utility functions with no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; utility functions are safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, possibly due to network-related functions, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with a few reports assigning 0.2, likely reflecting the network-related functions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (or 0), depending on the interpretation of network functions. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The functions involve network requests, URL validation, and data processing, but all are implemented safely.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The consistent low scores across reports are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Security risk score:** **0** (or 0.2 if conservative, but 0 is more accurate here)",
