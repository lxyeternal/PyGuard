  "purpose": "Utility functions for HTTP requests, URL validation, ID parsing, data grouping, and dictionary merging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as URLs, IDs, iterable data, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems or handle untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed within functions; no external data flows or network activity are initiated by these functions themselves.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The network-related functions (requests, URL parsing) are implemented using standard libraries without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with clear, well-documented logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The network request setup uses retries with established libraries, and URL validation relies on standard parsing. ID parsing accommodates different formats, and data grouping and merging are straightforward. The functions do not perform any dangerous operations or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The functions are standard utilities suitable for use in broader applications. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is conservatively set at 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential misuse in larger contexts.",
