  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard utility functions, low security risk (0.2), malware score 0.\n- **Comments:** The functions are benign, with no network activity or secret handling. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** This is a straightforward utility module with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard functions, no suspicious activity, malware score 0, high confidence (1).\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious intent, no obfuscation, typical use of third-party libraries.\n- **Assessment:** Benign utility code, very low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard utility functions, no malicious behavior, malware score 0, confidence 0.95.\n- **Comments:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, safe practices.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—benign utility functions, no malware, malware score 0, confidence 1.\n- **Comments:** No obfuscation or malicious intent, standard safe code.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign assessment, malware score 0, but a security risk score of 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No malicious behavior detected; the low security risk might reflect general caution rather than actual issues.\n- **Assessment:** No malware or obfuscation; the low security risk is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently report 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), consistent with benign utility functions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of well-known, standard utility functions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, or code injection observed.\n- The functions operate on trusted parameters and use safe libraries.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** (confirmed no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** Given the low security risk scores and benign code, an overall risk score of **0.1** seems appropriate—indicating minimal security concern but acknowledging that utility code can be misused if integrated into larger, insecure systems.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The provided reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent. The scores align well with the findings.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and aligns with the reports' assessments.",
