  "purpose": "Importing modules and classes related to annotations, documents, projects, and sections within a local package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only local module imports",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from local modules. There are no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The imports appear to be part of a package's internal structure, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not read external inputs or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward set of import statements for internal modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application structure, used for organizing code components.",
