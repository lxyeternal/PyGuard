{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization or import setup, organizing internal class and function imports for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules; no data flows from external sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, typical for package setup. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is evident. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements for internal modules. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
