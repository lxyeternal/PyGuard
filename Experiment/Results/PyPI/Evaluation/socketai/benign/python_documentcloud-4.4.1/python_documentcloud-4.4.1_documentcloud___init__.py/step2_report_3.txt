  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The code appears to be a typical package/module setup, likely an `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: it is just import statements.\n- There is no evidence of data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, with confidence at 1.\n- Given the nature of the code, these scores seem appropriate:\n  - Malware: 0 (benign imports)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (clear import statements)\n  - Security risk: 0 (no vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, assigning any risk higher than 0 is unwarranted.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a typical, benign set of import statements for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
