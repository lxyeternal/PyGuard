  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its data flows, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary**: The code manages documents, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is a client SDK for document management, performing typical operations like uploads, retrievals, and searches. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The malware score of 0 aligns with this.  \n- **Score justification**: The low malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, it describes standard API client behavior with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment**: The analysis correctly notes the use of retry sessions, standard network requests, and file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Score justification**: Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary**: Again, the code is a typical client SDK with no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment**: The review points out standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The logic is straightforward.  \n- **Score justification**: Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary**: The code is a standard API client with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment**: The analysis emphasizes the absence of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Use of retry sessions and standard network handling is normal.  \n- **Score justification**: Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary**: Similar to others, the code is a typical SDK for document management with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Score justification**: Malware score of 0 fits the evidence.  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Synthesis**:  \n- **Malware scores** are all 0 across reports, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated scores** are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n- **Risk scores** are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting standard client SDK behavior without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**My own assessment** after reviewing all reports and the code:  \n- The code is a well-structured, standard API client SDK for document management.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.  \n- The data flows involve typical network requests, file handling, and URL manipulations, all within expected patterns.  \n- The use of retry sessions and error handling indicates robustness, not malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommended scores**:  \n- **Malware**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n- **Risk**: **0.1–0.2** (very low, standard SDK behavior)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and the low risk scores are justified.",
