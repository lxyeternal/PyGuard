  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described data flows, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured API client for document management.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The network interactions, file handling, and data processing are typical for such SDKs.\n- The use of utility functions like `requests_retry_session()` and dynamic attribute generation (`__getattr__`) are common patterns, not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears clean; no issues are confirmed as malicious or flawed.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the code's purpose and potential data flows.\n- They acknowledge the dynamic attribute generation, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but in this context, it is standard.\n- No reasoning errors or flawed conclusions are evident.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), aligning with the findings.\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores:\n- The code is a typical SDK with no malicious intent, so a **malware score of 0** is justified.\n- The **risk score** remains low, around 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard network and file operations.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious behavior, instead focusing on standard SDK functionality.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*Justified: No malicious activity, payloads, or backdoors detected.*\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*Justified: The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard patterns.*\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n*Justified: Slight potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but overall low risk.*\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented client SDK for document management. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is evident. The provided reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis indicates a very low security concern, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
