  "purpose": "A client SDK for managing documents via the DocumentCloud API, including upload, retrieval, search, and processing functions.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to API endpoints, file reads for uploads, URL inputs for remote files, environment variables for configuration (implied), dynamic attribute access for resource URLs.",
  "sinks": "API responses (JSON, content), file content (for downloads), network calls to external URLs, potential data leaks if misused (though none evident).",
  "flows": "Input sources (user files, URLs) → API calls (upload, search, get) → responses (JSON, file content) → output or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of `requests_retry_session()` is standard, not malicious. Dynamic attribute handling is typical for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client SDK for document management. It performs typical operations such as uploading files or URLs, batch processing, and resource retrieval. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden payloads are present. Network interactions use retry sessions, which are common for robustness. Data flows involve standard file I/O and HTTP requests. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are observed. The dynamic attribute generation in `__getattr__` is a common pattern in SDKs, not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-implemented SDK for document management with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated components. Security risks are minimal, and the malware score is 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard network and file operations without vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
