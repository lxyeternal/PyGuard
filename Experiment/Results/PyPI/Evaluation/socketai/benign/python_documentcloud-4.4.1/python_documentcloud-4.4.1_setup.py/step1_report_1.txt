{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'python-documentcloud' including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long_description; static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data handling beyond package metadata declaration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic data flows or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution detected. All data appears to be static or file-based read.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets up package metadata and dependencies using static values and reading a README file. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no code execution, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors. All dependencies are declared explicitly, and the setup function follows standard patterns. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It functions solely to configure package installation parameters.",
