{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'python-documentcloud' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or external data manipulations detected.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into 'long_description'. No flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; dependencies are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for a long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated segments. All dependencies are common and well-known. No external network connections, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
