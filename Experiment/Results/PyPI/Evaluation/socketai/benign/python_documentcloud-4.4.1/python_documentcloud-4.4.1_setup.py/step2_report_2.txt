  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Dependencies are common and appropriate for package setup.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, which is typical and safe.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original, standard setup script.\n- **Presence of issues:** None are detected—no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None evident; the code is purely configuration.\n- **Data flows:** Static data, no untrusted inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious code.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct, no security risks.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The dependencies are standard, and the code does not execute any untrusted code or perform network operations.\n- The reading of README.md is safe, as it's a local file.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Note:** Since all reports agree and the analysis is consistent, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is benign and standard.**\n- **Scores are appropriate.**\n- **No further action needed.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The setup script is safe, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
