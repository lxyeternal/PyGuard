  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'python-documentcloud', defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static strings for package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with static data and no dynamic or untrusted inputs. Dependencies are common packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The code reads a local README.md file, which is safe. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues. The provided reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
