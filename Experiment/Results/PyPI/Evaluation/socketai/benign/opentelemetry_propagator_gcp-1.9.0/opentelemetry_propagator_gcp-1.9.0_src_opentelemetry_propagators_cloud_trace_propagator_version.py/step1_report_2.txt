  "flows": "No data flows; this is purely metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, functions, or dynamic features; only comments and version info",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version declaration. There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or code logic. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The presence of license comments is standard and benign. The version string is typical for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This file contains only licensing comments and a version string, with no executable or malicious code. It is safe and unlikely to be malicious.",
