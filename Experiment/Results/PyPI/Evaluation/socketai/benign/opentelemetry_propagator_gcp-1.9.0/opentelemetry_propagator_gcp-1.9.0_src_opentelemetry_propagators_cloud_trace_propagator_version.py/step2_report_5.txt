  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment.\n- No functions, data input/output, or executable logic are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code in question is just metadata: license comments and a version string.\n- No actual code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- Therefore, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors to confirm.\n\n**Errors or flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and metadata-only.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The reasoning for these scores is sound given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code contains only license comments and a version string, there is no security risk.\n- The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation is 0, as there is no obfuscated code.\n- Overall security risk is 0, as expected.\n\n**Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- No such claims are made; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all the reports and the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely metadata, licensing comments, and a version string.\n- No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\nThis code is standard open-source package metadata and poses no security concern.",
