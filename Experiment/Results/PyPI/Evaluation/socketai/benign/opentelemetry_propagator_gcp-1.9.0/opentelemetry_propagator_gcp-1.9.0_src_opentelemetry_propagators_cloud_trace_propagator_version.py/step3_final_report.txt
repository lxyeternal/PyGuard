  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, including licensing information and version declaration, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata without data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version assignment, with no functions, data input/output, or executable logic. It is standard metadata for an open-source package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence in benignity is high (1), with no indicators of malware or obfuscation (scores 0). The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature. The code does not contain any anomalies or suspicious elements. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
