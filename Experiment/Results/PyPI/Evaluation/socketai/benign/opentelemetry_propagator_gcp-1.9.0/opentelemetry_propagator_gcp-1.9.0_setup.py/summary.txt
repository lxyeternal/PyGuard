  "conclusion": "The script employs a standard but potentially unsafe pattern of executing external code to retrieve version info. While no malicious activity is detected, the use of exec() introduces a security risk if the version file is compromised. The scores assigned are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk at around 0.4. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer alternatives such as importing the version as a module or reading static data is recommended."
