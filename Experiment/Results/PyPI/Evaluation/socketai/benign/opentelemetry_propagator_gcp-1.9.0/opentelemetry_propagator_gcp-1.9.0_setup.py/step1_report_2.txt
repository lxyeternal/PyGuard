  "flows": "Read version.py file -> execute its contents -> assign __version__ to setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from a file, which could potentially contain malicious code if the file were compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version.py file and executes its contents with exec(), which is a security concern if the file is tampered with or malicious. The rest of the code is standard setup script using setuptools, with no other suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets. The exec() function is a potential attack surface, but in a controlled package environment, it is common to extract variables from a version file. No other malicious behavior or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with the only notable concern being the use of exec() to execute code from version.py. If the version.py file is secure and trusted, the risk is minimal. However, exec() can be dangerous if the file is compromised. Overall, no malicious intent detected, but the exec() usage warrants caution.",
