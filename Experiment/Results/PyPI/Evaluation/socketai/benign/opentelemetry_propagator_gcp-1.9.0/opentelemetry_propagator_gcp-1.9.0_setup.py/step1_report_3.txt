  "flows": "open() reading version.py -> exec() executing the code within version.py",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from version.py, which could be malicious if the file content is tampered with. The rest of the code is standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools, then constructs a path to version.py within the source directory. It opens this file and executes its contents via exec() into the PACKAGE_INFO dictionary. This pattern is risky because exec() can run arbitrary code if version.py is malicious or tampered with. The rest of the code performs standard setup activities. No other suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the use of exec() to execute code from version.py, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. Aside from this, the code is typical for setup scripts. The risk is moderate due to the exec() usage.",
