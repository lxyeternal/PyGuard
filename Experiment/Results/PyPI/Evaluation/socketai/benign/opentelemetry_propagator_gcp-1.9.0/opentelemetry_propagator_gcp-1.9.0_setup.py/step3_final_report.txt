  "analysis": "The code reads a version.py file and executes its content with exec(), which is a common but risky pattern in setup scripts. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The primary concern is that if 'version.py' is tampered with, executing it could lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score is appropriately low (0), as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), reflecting the inherent risk of executing external code without validation, especially if the environment's integrity isn't guaranteed. The scores are consistent with the known pattern and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script employs a standard but potentially unsafe pattern of executing external code to retrieve version info. While no malicious activity is detected, the use of exec() introduces a security risk if the version file is compromised. The scores assigned are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk at around 0.4. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer alternatives such as importing the version as a module or reading static data is recommended.",
