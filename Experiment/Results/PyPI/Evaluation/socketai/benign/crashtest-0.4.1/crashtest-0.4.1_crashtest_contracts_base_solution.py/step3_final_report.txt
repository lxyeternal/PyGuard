  "purpose": "A simple class definition for managing solution metadata with no external data handling or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for title and description, internal _links list",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no data leaks or external communication",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to internal attributes, then accessed via properties",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Solution, initializing internal attributes for title, description, and links. It provides read-only properties to access these attributes. There are no external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, simple, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. All scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriately zero, with high confidence. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
