  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a subclass with a constructor, properties for accessing private attributes, and no external data processing or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The structure is simple and standard for class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
