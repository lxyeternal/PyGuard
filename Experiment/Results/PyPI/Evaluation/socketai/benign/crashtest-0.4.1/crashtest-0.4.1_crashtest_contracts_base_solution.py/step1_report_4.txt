{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for solutions with attributes for title, description, and links.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the constructor parameters 'title' and 'description'.",
  "targets": "The class provides read-only access to attributes, no direct data sinks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns values to private attributes; property methods return these attributes without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a contract class, then defines a subclass 'BaseSolution' with an initializer that sets title, description, and links. It provides property getters for these attributes. There are no external data inputs beyond constructor arguments, no I/O, no network activity, no code execution or data leaks. The code appears to be a simple, standard class setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition for a solution object, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and does not pose security concerns.",
