  "purpose": "Defines a base class for solutions with attributes for title, description, and links.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'title' and 'description' in the constructor, and the '_links' list that can be externally accessed via a property.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; no external data flow or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a subclass with an initializer setting internal attributes, and provides read-only properties. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks are utilized. The code appears to be a simple, benign class structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition for managing solution data with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
