  "purpose": "Defines a BaseSolution class inheriting from Solution, used for managing solution details such as title, description, and links.",
  "sources": "Input sources are parameters passed to the __init__ method (title and description).",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks identified; no data is being written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes and then through property methods; no external or untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with basic attribute initialization and read-only property methods. There are no external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations present. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any file operations, network communications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing solution data with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
