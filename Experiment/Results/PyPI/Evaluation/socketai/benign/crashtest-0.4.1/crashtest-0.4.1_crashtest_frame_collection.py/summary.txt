  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores aligning appropriately. The slight elevation of security risk in one report (0.1) is justifiable but can be adjusted to zero for consistency."
