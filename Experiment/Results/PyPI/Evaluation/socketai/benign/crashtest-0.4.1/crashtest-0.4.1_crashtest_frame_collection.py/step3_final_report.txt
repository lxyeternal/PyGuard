  "purpose": "A subclass of list managing Frame objects with deduplication and count tracking functionalities.",
  "sources": "In-memory list of Frame objects, accessed via iteration and slicing.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output or untrusted data flows; internal processing only.",
  "flows": "Frames are compared within the list to identify duplicates; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a FrameCollection class for managing Frame objects, providing methods for counting repetitions, deduplicating frames via the compact() method, and internal management of frame sequences. It uses standard Python features, with no external I/O, network activity, or obfuscation. The deduplication logic is complex but appears correct and safe. No external data leaks, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The security risk is minimal, with scores appropriately set to zero or near-zero in all reports. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a utility for frame sequence management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores aligning appropriately. The slight elevation of security risk in one report (0.1) is justifiable but can be adjusted to zero for consistency.",
