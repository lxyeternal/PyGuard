  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded URLs/credentials, dynamic imports, network/file operations, obfuscated strings, base64 or encrypted payloads.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded secrets flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex string manipulations, dynamic imports, hardcoded secrets, base64 or encrypted payloads, unusual control flow, complex variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Presence of hardcoded secrets and encrypted payloads further increase suspicion. Benign code shows straightforward logic without suspicious patterns. No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors was found in benign samples. Suspicious samples demonstrate behaviors consistent with exfiltration or backdoor setup. Scores are aligned with the level of suspicion, with higher scores for obfuscated and suspicious code, and low scores for benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates that the suspicious code samples exhibit behaviors consistent with moderate malicious intent, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious scoring. Benign samples show no malicious indicators. Overall, the scores reflect the evidence, with slight adjustments to better match the suspicion levels.",
