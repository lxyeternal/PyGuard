{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Inspector class for analyzing exceptions and their traceback frames, likely for debugging or error reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading exception object, accessing exception traceback, using inspect.getframeinfo and inspect.FrameInfo functions.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Exception object is passed to constructor -> traceback is accessed via __traceback__ -> frame info is retrieved via inspect functions -> frames are collected into FrameCollection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Usage of inspect could be potentially unsafe if misused, but here it's confined to traceback inspection. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an Inspector object that extracts traceback frames from an exception for analysis. It uses standard Python introspection modules (inspect) and custom Frame/FrameCollection classes. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or code injections. The code is straightforward and focuses solely on traceback analysis. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The use of inspect is standard for debugging purposes and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for exception analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly uses standard Python debugging tools and does not contain malicious patterns.",
