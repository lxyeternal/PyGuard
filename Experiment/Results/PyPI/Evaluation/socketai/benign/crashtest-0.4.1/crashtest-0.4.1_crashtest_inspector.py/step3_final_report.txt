{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Inspector class that extracts traceback frames from an exception object using Python's inspect module, storing frame details for analysis.",
  "sources": "Access to exception's __traceback__ attribute, use of inspect.getframeinfo() on traceback frames.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Traceback frames flow from exception object to FrameCollection via inspect functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard exception traceback extraction using Python's inspect module and custom classes for frame storage. It does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks. Use of traceback inspection is typical in debugging, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign exception inspection utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports due to traceback manipulation potential is justified but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
