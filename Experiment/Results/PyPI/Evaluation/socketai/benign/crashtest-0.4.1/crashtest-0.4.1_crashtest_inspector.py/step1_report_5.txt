{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Inspector class that analyzes exception objects, extracting traceback frames and exception details.",
  "sources": "Reads exception object properties (__traceback__, __context__, __class__.__name__, str(exception)) and inspect module functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input into vulnerable outputs; primarily reads data for introspection.",
  "flows": "Extracts traceback frames from exception (__traceback__) and processes them through inspect.getframeinfo to populate internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on exception introspection, retrieving traceback frames and exception metadata. It uses standard Python introspection and exception attributes. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure is typical for debugging or error analysis modules. It relies on well-known Python features and third-party modules (crashtest), which appear standard and non-malicious. No signs of backdoors, malicious data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception introspection utility with no malicious intent. It provides structured exception data for analysis or debugging purposes without executing any suspicious actions.",
