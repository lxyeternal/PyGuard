{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Inspector class for analyzing exceptions and their traceback frames, primarily for debugging or crash analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Exception object passed to __init__, specifically exception.__traceback__ for traceback frames",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no external network, file, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "Exception object → traceback frames → FrameCollection and Frame instances, with no external or sensitive data transfer",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of inspect and custom classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class to analyze exception details and traceback frames using standard Python inspect module. It safely accesses traceback information and constructs Frame objects, which appear to be for debugging purposes. No suspicious data handling, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on collecting traceback frames from an exception.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard debugging utility for extracting exception details and traceback frames. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It is a benign utility module.",
