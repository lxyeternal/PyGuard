  "purpose": "Manages a registry of solution provider classes, dynamically instantiates them, and retrieves solutions for exceptions.",
  "sources": "Exception object passed to get_solutions_for_exception; class list provided during registration.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on solution provider instances; potential invocation of external class methods.",
  "flows": "Exception object flows into solution provider methods; class types are instantiated dynamically during get_solutions_for_exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. Broad exception handling could mask errors but is typical in plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code manages plugin-like solution providers, instantiates classes dynamically, and retrieves solutions. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The main security concern is trusting external provider classes, which could be malicious if untrusted. Broad exception handling is used to prevent crashes but could hide errors. The code itself is straightforward and benign. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting potential risk if external classes are malicious but no evidence within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign plugin management pattern with minimal inherent security risks. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external provider classes, which cannot be assessed here. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
