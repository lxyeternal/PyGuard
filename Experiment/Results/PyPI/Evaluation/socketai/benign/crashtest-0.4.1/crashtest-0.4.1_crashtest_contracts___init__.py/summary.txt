  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior. While some reports indicate suspicious patterns like obfuscation and dynamic code, these do not amount to confirmed malware. The overall security risk remains low. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. Continuous monitoring and further code review are recommended if more details become available."
