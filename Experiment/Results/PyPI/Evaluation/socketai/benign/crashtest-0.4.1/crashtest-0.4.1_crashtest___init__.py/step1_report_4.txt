  "purpose": "Define the module's version and enable future annotations for type hints",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading observed)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks or external communications)",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import for annotations is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations and sets a version string. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code appears to be a typical module header with no malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment contains only standard module metadata and future import statements, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
