{
  "purpose": "This code fragment appears to set a future import and define a version string, likely part of a larger module or package.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement, which imports annotations from __future__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this small snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a __future__ import and a version string declaration. No external inputs, data processing, or sensitive operations are present. The import statement is a common Python feature to enable future language features. The version string suggests this is part of a package, but no malicious or security-sensitive code is included.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this fragment alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger codebase.",
