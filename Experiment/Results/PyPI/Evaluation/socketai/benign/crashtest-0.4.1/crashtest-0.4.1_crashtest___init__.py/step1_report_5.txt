{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module with a version string, likely part of a larger Python package or script.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only an import statement from __future__, which enables annotations, and a version string assignment. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. This is typical boilerplate code used in Python packages to specify compatibility and versioning, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as a simple module header with versioning and compatibility imports. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
