{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the version of a Python package or module, likely for documentation or package management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's special __future__ import and assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points, as the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply imports a feature and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. The __future__ import is standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__, which is used for forward reference support in type hints, and defines a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The simplicity indicates a typical version declaration common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected.",
