  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of a `__future__` import and a `__version__` string assignment.\n   - There are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Issue Presence & Logical Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and typical for Python modules.\n   - The reports appropriately note the lack of data flow, sinks, or sources that could be exploited.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, correctly reflecting the benign nature.\n   - **Confidence**: All are at 1, justified by the straightforward, standard code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as part of a package's metadata.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Final Estimation**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the thorough reasoning, there's no need to adjust scores.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is benign, standard boilerplate, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this snippet.",
