{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module header, importing future features for compatibility and defining a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could leak or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a future import and a version string assignment, typical for Python modules. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, standard boilerplate code. The absence of data flows, external inputs, or malicious patterns confirms its harmless nature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard module header with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring accurately reflects this.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
