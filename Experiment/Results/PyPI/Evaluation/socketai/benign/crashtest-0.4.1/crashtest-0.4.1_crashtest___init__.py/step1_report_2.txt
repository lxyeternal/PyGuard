{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the future import for annotations and defines a version string, likely as part of a package's metadata.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the static version string, which is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a minimal fragment without data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; it is a typical package initialization segment.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a future import for annotations, which is a standard feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, and a version string assignment. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions. It does not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. As a minimal snippet, it shows no signs of malware, security issues, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as part of package metadata or initialization with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
