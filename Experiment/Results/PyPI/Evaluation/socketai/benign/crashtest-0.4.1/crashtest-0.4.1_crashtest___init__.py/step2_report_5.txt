  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code snippet:\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__version__ = \"0.4.1\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code only imports a feature from `__future__` and defines a version string.\n- No external inputs, data processing, or output occurs.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python package initialization.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the purpose as setting a future import and defining a version.\n- **Logic:** No issues; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; correctly notes the purpose and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Correctly assigns malware and risk as 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states this is a version declaration with a future import.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no malware or security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; standard module header.\n- **Scores:** Correctly 0 for malware/security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Correct; minimal boilerplate code.\n- **Scores:** Properly 0 for malware/security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that this code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are consistent and reasonable.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the code's content; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**, given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Since the code is a standard module header, there's no need to escalate the risk or malware scores.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's content.",
