  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up and distributing a Python package named 'crashtest'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, package list, and package data for installation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; mainly static configuration data.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses static data to configure the package installation; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It defines package information and calls setup() with static arguments. No external data sources, no dynamic code, and no suspicious instructions are present. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign setup configuration for the 'crashtest' package. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
