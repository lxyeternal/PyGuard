  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'crashtest' Python package, facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, package list, and package data from hardcoded variables and parameters within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "None present; the script only defines package setup parameters and calls the setup() function.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata, package info) flows directly into setup(), which performs package installation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic execution or external data sources are used. The author information is static but benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package-related variables, including package names, data, and metadata. It then calls setup() with these parameters. The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script. No indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code does not contain dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. It strictly handles package configuration and distribution setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It simply defines package metadata and invokes the setup process.",
