  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata and installation parameters for the 'crashtest' Python library.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package list definitions, and setup keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup function executes package installation.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard setup script without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools to specify package metadata, packages, data, and dependencies. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code execution beyond package setup, and no suspicious code structures. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present. The code follows typical setup.py conventions and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for the 'crashtest' package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
