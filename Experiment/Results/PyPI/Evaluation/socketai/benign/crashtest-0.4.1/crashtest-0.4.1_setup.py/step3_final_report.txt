  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'crashtest' library, defining metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, package list, package data, and setup() call with predefined arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows directly into setup() without dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with all data hardcoded and no dynamic or malicious elements. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data fetching are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The reports uniformly agree on its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which are consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
