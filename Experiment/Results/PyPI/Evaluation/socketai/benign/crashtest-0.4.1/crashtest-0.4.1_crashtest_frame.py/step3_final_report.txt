  "purpose": "A utility class for inspecting Python stack frames, caching file contents, and providing frame metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading filename attribute from inspect.FrameInfo, opening files with open() using filename.",
  "sinks": "File read operations that could expose contents of arbitrary files if filenames are untrusted.",
  "flows": "From filename attribute in FrameInfo to open() call, then caching and returning file content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Frame class that wraps inspect.FrameInfo objects, caching file contents to optimize repeated reads. It reads files from disk based on frame info filenames, with exception handling to avoid crashes if files are inaccessible. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is the potential exposure of sensitive data if filenames are manipulated or untrusted, but this is a typical behavior for debugging or profiling tools, not malicious code. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard debugging utility that reads and caches file contents based on frame information. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minor security risk associated with reading arbitrary files is inherent to such tools and does not indicate malicious intent.",
