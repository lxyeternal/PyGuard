{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Frame' for inspecting and caching information about Python call frames, including file content retrieval and frame metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads filename, frame info, and code context from inspect.FrameInfo objects, and reads file contents from disk.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk based on filename; does not write or execute untrusted data; no external network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Uses filename and frame info as sources; file reading occurs if content is not cached; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns, and no backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses type annotations, caching for file content, and safe file handling with exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The class provides standard inspection functionality without external or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for inspecting stack frames with safe file handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
