{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Frame class used to represent and cache information about Python stack frames, including reading file content and providing properties related to frame details.",
  "sources": "The code reads filename, frame, and code context from inspect.FrameInfo objects, and reads file contents from the filesystem using open() with utf-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to an internal class-level cache (_content_cache) and reads file content based on filenames, but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inspecting frame info (source) to reading file content (sink), with caching to optimize repeated access. No external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of open() is standard, and there are no dynamic code executions or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Frame class that caches file content to reduce disk I/O when inspecting frame details. It reads filename and code context from inspect.FrameInfo objects, caching file content internally. There are no inputs from untrusted sources like network or environment variables, nor any outputs or side effects indicating malicious intent. The only notable operation is reading file content based on filename, which is a standard debugging or introspection utility, with error handling for file access issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for inspecting and caching frame information during debugging or profiling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
