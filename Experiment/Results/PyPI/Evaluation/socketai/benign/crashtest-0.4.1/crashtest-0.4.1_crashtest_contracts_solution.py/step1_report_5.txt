{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract Solution class with properties that are meant to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class properties are placeholders for subclasses to implement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code contains only abstract property definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses the 'raise NotImplementedError()' pattern in property methods, which is standard for abstract base classes; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class with property methods that are intended to be overridden. The use of 'from __future__ import annotations' is for postponed evaluation of annotations, which is common in modern Python. No data inputs, external calls, or suspicious code is present. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical design patterns for abstract classes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class definition for a solution framework with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
