{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract Solution class with properties for title, description, and documentation links, intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code reads only from class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation; code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and implements a common pattern for abstract classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hinting, then defines a class Solution with three properties that raise NotImplementedError. This indicates an abstract base class designed for extension. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The code serves as a structural template for subclasses, with no embedded malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class template with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior and appears safe for use in larger codebases.",
