  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Solution' with properties to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sources": "Class definition and property methods raising NotImplementedError",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Class properties intended for subclass implementation; no data flow or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward abstract class pattern with no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract class with three properties that raise NotImplementedError, used as an interface. It imports __future__.annotations for forward references. There are no external data reads, no data leaks, no dynamic execution, and no malicious or obfuscated code. The pattern is common for defining interfaces or base classes in Python. The code does not perform any actions beyond defining properties, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this benign, structural pattern, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class pattern with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
