{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract Solution class with properties for title, description, and documentation links",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading; the code does not read external input",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leak information",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural with no execution logic",
  "anomalies": "Presence of abstract property methods raising NotImplementedError, which is typical for abstract base classes; no suspicious or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Solution' with three property methods that are placeholders raising NotImplementedError. There are no data reads, no network interactions, and no executable code beyond class and method definitions. The structure suggests it is intended as an interface or abstract class for subclasses to implement. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns; it appears to be a standard, benign abstraction.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign abstract class defining an interface for solution metadata. It shows no signs of malware or security issues.",
