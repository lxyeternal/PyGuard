  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: an abstract class `Solution` with three properties that raise `NotImplementedError`.\n- The code is straightforward, using `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references.\n- No external data, input/output, or malicious code is present.\n- The code pattern is typical for defining interfaces or base classes in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the described pattern: an abstract class with unimplemented properties. No discrepancies.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard abstract class pattern with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n- **Are the scores given reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n  \n  These are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Security Risk:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The `raise NotImplementedError()` pattern is standard for abstract classes.\n- No external calls, data processing, or data leaks are involved.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Malware score should remain **0**.\n- Security risk score should remain **0**.\n- Obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n### Risk Score Justification:\n- Since the code is purely structural, defining an interface, and contains no malicious or suspicious features, the overall **risk score** should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**All reports are accurate in their assessment.** They correctly identify the code as benign and standard, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a straightforward abstract class pattern.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are present.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as they are: all zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
