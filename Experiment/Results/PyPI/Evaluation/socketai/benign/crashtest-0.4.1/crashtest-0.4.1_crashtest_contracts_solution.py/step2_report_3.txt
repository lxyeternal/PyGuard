  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines an abstract class `Solution` with three properties: `solution_title`, `solution_description`, and `documentation_links`.\n- Each property raises `NotImplementedError`, indicating they are meant to be overridden.\n- The code imports `__future__.annotations` for forward reference support.\n- There are no external data reads, data sinks, or executable logic beyond class and method definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is a standard abstract class pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors; the code is syntactically correct and follows common design patterns.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning and logic in the reports\n- **Logical soundness:** The reports correctly identify that this is an abstract class intended for subclassing, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Suspicious elements:** No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\n- **Are these scores reasonable?** Yes, they are consistent with the analysis. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware scores\n- All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, no external calls, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports correctly state that there are no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n- The pattern of raising `NotImplementedError` in abstract properties is standard and not suspicious.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n### Malware score: **0**\n- No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n### Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n### Risk score: **0**\n- No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n## Overall recommendation:\n- The code is a benign abstract class pattern, common in object-oriented design.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious, and straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
