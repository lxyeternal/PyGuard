{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class 'Solution' with property methods that raise NotImplementedError, intended as a base class for subclasses to implement specific solutions with title, description, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a class structure with method placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no unusual or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for forward reference support, defines a class with three property methods that raise NotImplementedError. This pattern is common for abstract base classes. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious abstract class intended for extension. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior based on the provided snippet.",
