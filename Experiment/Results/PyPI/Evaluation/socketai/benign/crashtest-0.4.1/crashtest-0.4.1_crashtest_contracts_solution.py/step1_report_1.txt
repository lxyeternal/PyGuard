  "purpose": "Define an abstract class 'Solution' with properties for title, description, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations involving untrusted data or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines an abstract class structure.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of abstract class with unimplemented properties is typical in design patterns; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, defines a class 'Solution' with three properties that raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be overridden. No data reading, data sinks, or external calls are present. The code appears to be a standard abstract base class setup for future subclass implementations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malicious code. The design pattern is common for defining interfaces or base classes.",
