  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static, straightforward Sphinx configuration file.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, user input handling, network calls, or data processing.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code consists solely of variable assignments, comments, and import statements for standard modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a valid Sphinx configuration file. No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques are present.\n- **Security risks:** No security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external threats are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Completely benign, static configuration. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Same as above, no dynamic or external code. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Standard configuration, no malicious indicators. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Purely static, safe configuration. |\n\nAll reports are consistent in their assessment. The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior or code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques used)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent.\n- The code is a standard, static configuration file with no suspicious patterns.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose. No further action needed.",
