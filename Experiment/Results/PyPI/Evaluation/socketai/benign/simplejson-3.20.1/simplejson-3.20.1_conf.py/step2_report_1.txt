  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling from untrusted sources are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The import statements are standard and used appropriately for configuration purposes.\n- Commented-out code and placeholders are typical in such configuration files and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, reflecting no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate in their assessment.\n- No logical flaws, misjudgments, or unreasonable scoring are evident.\n- The static nature of the code and its purpose as a configuration file strongly suggest no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The analysis is consistent and justified.\n- There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\nGiven all the evidence, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis and the nature of the code as a standard documentation configuration file.",
