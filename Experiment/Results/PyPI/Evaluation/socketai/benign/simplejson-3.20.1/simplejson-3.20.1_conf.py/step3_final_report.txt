{
  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, setting up project details, paths, and output options without executing any dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static variable assignments, comments, and import statements (sys, os), which are standard and do not process untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations; the code does not handle external inputs or perform network or file operations beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors; the code is straightforward and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Sphinx configuration file containing variable assignments, comments, and import statements. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or data handling from untrusted sources. The absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. All relevant signals point to a safe, standard configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
