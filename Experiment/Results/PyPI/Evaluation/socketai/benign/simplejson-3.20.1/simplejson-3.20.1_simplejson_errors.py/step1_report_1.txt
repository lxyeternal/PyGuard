  "purpose": "Define error classes and utility functions for JSON decoding error handling in simplejson",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'doc' (JSON document) and 'pos' (error position), 'end' (error end position), and message 'msg' parameters",
  "sinks": "The code formats error messages and raises exceptions, but does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or command execution",
  "flows": "Input 'doc' and positional data flow into message formatting functions, leading to the creation of error message strings used in exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code performs straightforward error reporting and class definition",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for error reporting in JSON parsing, including calculating line and column numbers from character positions and formatting error messages. The JSONDecodeError class extends ValueError, storing parsing error details and providing a custom initializer and reduction method. No external inputs are executed or transformed into code; the data handling is limited to string formatting and exception construction. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The functions depend solely on safe string and positional operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for JSON error handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not process or execute untrusted data beyond formatting error messages. Overall, it appears safe and straightforward.",
