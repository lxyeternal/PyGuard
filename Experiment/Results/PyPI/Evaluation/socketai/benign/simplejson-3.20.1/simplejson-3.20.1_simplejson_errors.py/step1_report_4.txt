{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes and helper functions for JSON decoding errors, including formatting error messages with line and column info.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'doc' parameter in functions 'linecol' and 'errmsg'. It processes positional data within the JSON document.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting functions generate strings; no data flows to external systems. The JSONDecodeError class stores error details but does not perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON document and error positions) flow through 'linecol' and 'errmsg' functions to produce formatted error messages stored in exception instances.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward error handling for JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for calculating line and column positions within a JSON document based on character index. These functions are used in 'errmsg' to generate human-readable error messages. The JSONDecodeError class extends ValueError, capturing error details such as message, document, positions, and line/column info. It is used for reporting JSON parsing errors. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code relies on standard Python string processing and exception handling, with no external calls or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for error handling in a JSON parsing library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is purely functional, focusing on error message formatting and exception data encapsulation.",
