{
  "purpose": "Defines error handling classes and functions for JSON decoding errors, including custom exception class JSONDecodeError.",
  "sources": "Reads include the input parameters of functions linecol() and errmsg(), as well as the class attributes in JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the exception message formatting in errmsg() and __init__() when raising errors.",
  "flows": "Input data (doc, pos, end) flow into linecol() and errmsg() functions, which generate messages used in exceptions raised in JSONDecodeError.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation present. The code uses standard exception and message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for calculating line and column numbers from a document string, and formats error messages for JSON decoding errors. The JSONDecodeError class encapsulates these details, providing structured error information. There are no suspicious data flows, no external data sources, and no security-sensitive operations such as network I/O, file manipulation, or environment variable usage. The exception handling is standard, and all operations are related to error message creation and class attribute management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom error handling for JSON decoding, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a well-structured error class and helper functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
