  "purpose": "Define error handling classes and functions for JSON decoding errors in simplejson.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'doc' string parameter and position parameters ('pos', 'end') in functions.",
  "sinks": "Formatted error message strings constructed in 'errmsg' function and class properties such as 'msg', 'doc', 'pos', 'end'.",
  "flows": "Input 'doc' and position parameters flow into 'linecol' and 'errmsg' functions; error message string flows from 'errmsg' to exception initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for calculating line/column positions in a document and a custom exception class for JSON decoding errors. It uses string operations and class inheritance without executing any untrusted code or external inputs maliciously. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, and the class is a typical custom error class with no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard utility for error reporting in a JSON parsing library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
