  "purpose": "Define error classes and utility functions for JSON decoding error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON document string, position indices for errors, and optional end position.",
  "sinks": "Formatting error message strings that include document snippets and position info.",
  "flows": "Input document and position data flow into line/column calculations, then into formatted error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard string operations and exception handling without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward error handling for JSON parsing errors, with functions to compute line and column numbers from character positions and to format error messages. The JSONDecodeError class encapsulates error details, including message, document, positions, and line/column info. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations. The string formatting includes document snippets, which is typical for error messages but should be sanitized if displayed directly to users. Overall, the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of JSON error reporting. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
