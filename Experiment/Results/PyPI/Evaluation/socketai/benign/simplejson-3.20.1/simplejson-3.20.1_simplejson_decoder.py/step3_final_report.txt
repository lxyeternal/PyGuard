  "purpose": "Standard JSON decoder supporting hooks, special float values, and configurable parsing options.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON strings, unescapes string content, processes input data into Python objects.",
  "sinks": "Processes untrusted JSON input; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from raw string through parsing functions into Python data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; use of optional speedups is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured JSON decoder with support for hooks and special float constants. No embedded malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. External hooks could be misused if maliciously supplied, but this is a common feature and not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard JSON parser with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The minimal security risk stems from external hook usage, which is inherent to such decoders but not indicative of malicious intent.",
