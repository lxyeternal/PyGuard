{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility shims for Python 2 and 3, ensuring the code runs seamlessly across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, function definitions, type assignments",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code performs standard compatibility tasks without hidden or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code detects the Python version and defines compatibility functions and types accordingly. It handles imports, string and byte conversions, and type definitions in a typical manner for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious logic are present. The reload_module assignment is version-dependent, which is standard practice. All logic appears benign and intended for environment compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
