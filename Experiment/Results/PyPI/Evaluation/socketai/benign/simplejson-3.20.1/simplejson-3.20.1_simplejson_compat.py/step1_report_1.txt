  "purpose": "Provide Python 3 compatibility shims for code compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, functions, variables assigned based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no data leakage, network, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to different definitions of functions and types, but no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard compatibility patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically assigns functions and type aliases based on Python version, which is common for compatibility. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as code injection or data exfiltration, are present. It correctly distinguishes between Python 2 and 3, avoiding deprecated or insecure practices. The use of standard modules and version checks appear legitimate. No anomalous behaviors or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python 2/3 compatibility shim with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines helper functions and type aliases for cross-version support.",
