{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility shims for Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.version_info, imports from cStringIO, StringIO, importlib, imp, io, and usage of built-in functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or system impact.",
  "flows": "Code reads Python version info to set compatibility variables; defines functions and imports based on version; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses version checks and imports standard modules accordingly. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3, utilizing version checks to import modules and define types and functions accordingly. It employs standard library modules like sys, importlib, imp, io, and conditional definitions for bytes and string types. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The structure is clear, and the logic aligns with common compatibility practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a compatibility shim without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and relies solely on standard, safe library usage to adapt code between Python versions.",
