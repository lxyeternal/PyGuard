{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility shims for Python 2 and 3 compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads sys.version_info to determine environment and then defines or imports functions and types accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard compatibility code with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the Python version and conditionally defines functions and imports modules for compatibility. It defines functions like b(s) and unichr, and sets type aliases such as text_type and binary_type. The logic is straightforward and common in cross-version Python code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python compatibility shim with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It solely adapts environment-specific functions and types for cross-version compatibility.",
