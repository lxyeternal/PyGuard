{
  "purpose": "Provides Python 2/3 compatibility support by defining functions, types, and importing modules conditionally based on the Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, imported modules (cStringIO, StringIO, io, importlib, imp), environment variables (implicitly via sys), code execution (conditional definitions)",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Version check leads to different function/type definitions and module imports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard compatibility shim with straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and defines compatibility functions/types accordingly. It uses standard modules and practices without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with common compatibility strategies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately score the code as non-malicious with zero security risk. No further action or concern is warranted.",
