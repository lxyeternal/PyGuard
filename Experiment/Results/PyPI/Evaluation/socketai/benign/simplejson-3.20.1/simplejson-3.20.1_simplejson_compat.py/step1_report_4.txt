{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility shims for Python 2 and Python 3 differences.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, import statements, functions, and variables defining compatibility behaviors.",
  "sinks": "None present that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is primarily defining compatibility variables and functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated or version-specific constructs, but nothing unusual or malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the Python version and sets up various compatibility variables and functions accordingly. It defines 'b' for byte conversion, 'StringIO' imports, and type definitions for text and binary data. Uses standard version checks and imports. No external data handling, no execution of dynamic code, no data leaks or malicious actions. The code's purpose is solely to maintain cross-version compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python compatibility shim with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply manages differences between Python 2 and 3 for a larger project. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
