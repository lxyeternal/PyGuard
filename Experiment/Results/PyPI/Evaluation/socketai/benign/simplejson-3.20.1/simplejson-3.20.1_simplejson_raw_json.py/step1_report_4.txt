  "purpose": "Wrap an encoded JSON document for direct embedding in output",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'encoded_json'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "encoded_json is assigned to an instance variable; no further data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class RawJSON with an initializer that stores the provided encoded_json. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data leaks. The class appears to serve as a container for JSON data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward container class with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It serves its purpose of encapsulating JSON data without performing any dangerous operations.",
