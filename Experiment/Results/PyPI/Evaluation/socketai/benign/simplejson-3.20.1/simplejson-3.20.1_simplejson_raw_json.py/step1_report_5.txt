  "purpose": "The class RawJSON is designed to wrap an encoded JSON document for embedding purposes.",
  "sources": "The encoded_json parameter in the __init__ method, which receives input data during object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input data (encoded_json) is stored in an instance variable without further processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any unusual actions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that stores an input parameter. There are no functions that execute code, perform network operations, or manipulate data in a suspicious manner. The class appears to be a straightforward wrapper for JSON data, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a data container without any malicious or security-sensitive operations. It does not exhibit malware behavior or security risks.",
