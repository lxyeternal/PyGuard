{
  "purpose": "A simple container class to store an encoded JSON document for embedding or later use.",
  "sources": "The constructor parameter 'encoded_json' which is stored directly into an instance variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the class does not process or transmit data, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'encoded_json' flows directly into the instance variable without modification or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal class 'RawJSON' with an __init__ method that stores the provided 'encoded_json' parameter. There are no external calls, data processing, or network interactions. The class functions solely as a data container. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data wrapper with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
