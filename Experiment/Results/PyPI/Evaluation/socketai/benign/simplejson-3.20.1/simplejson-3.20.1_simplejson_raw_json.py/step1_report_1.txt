  "purpose": "Wraps an encoded JSON document for direct embedding in output",
  "sources": "The constructor receives 'encoded_json' as input",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transmitted in this snippet",
  "flows": "Input 'encoded_json' is stored as an instance variable; no further data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class 'RawJSON' with an initializer that stores the provided 'encoded_json'.
