{
  "purpose": "Wraps an encoded JSON document for direct embedding in output",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'encoded_json' in the constructor",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not output or process data beyond storing it",
  "flows": "Input 'encoded_json' is stored as an instance attribute; no further data flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple wrapper for an encoded JSON object, storing it without any processing or external interactions. There are no sources of untrusted data beyond the input parameter, which is stored directly. No sinks, external calls, or dynamic execution are present. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data wrapper with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
