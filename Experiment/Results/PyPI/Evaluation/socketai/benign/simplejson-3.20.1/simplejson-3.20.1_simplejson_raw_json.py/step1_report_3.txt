  "purpose": "Wrap an encoded JSON document for direct embedding in output",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'encoded_json' assigned to instance variable",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "Data from 'encoded_json' flows into the object attribute without transformation or external influence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed; code is straightforward and simple",
  "analysis": "The class defines a wrapper for encoded JSON data with an initializer that stores the data. There are no data processing, network operations, or system modifications present. The code solely assigns a parameter to an instance attribute without further logic or external calls, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign wrapper class with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. No suspicious activity is detected.",
