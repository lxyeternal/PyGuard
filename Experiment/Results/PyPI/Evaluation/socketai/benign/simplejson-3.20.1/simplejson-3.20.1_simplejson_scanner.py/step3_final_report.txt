  "purpose": "JSON token scanner with optional C extension fallback for efficient parsing.",
  "sources": "Input string data fed into the _scan_once or scan_once functions, including the initial string and index positions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include raising JSONDecodeError on invalid input; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is read character-by-character; specific characters trigger parsing routines (e.g., parse_string, parse_object, parse_array), with no external data or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard regex for number parsing; fallback mechanism for C extension is typical; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard JSON tokenizer with fallback to a C extension for performance. It carefully handles input characters, matching JSON tokens such as strings, numbers, null, true, false, and special constants like NaN and Infinity. Error handling is performed via JSONDecodeError. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The regex used is standard for number parsing, and the fallback mechanism is a common optimization. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or suspicious data leaks. It processes untrusted input safely, with proper error handling. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, clean, and aligns with typical JSON parsing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard JSON scanner with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its functionality and safety profile.",
