{
  "purpose": "The script compresses CSS files by reading input files, optionally inserting line breaks, and outputting the compressed CSS either to a file or stdout.",
  "sources": "Reading input filenames from command-line arguments; reading CSS content from specified files.",
  "sinks": "Writing compressed output to a specified output file or printing to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> file reading -> CSS compression -> output writing or print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code straightforwardly reads files and compresses CSS content without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse for command-line argument parsing and reads specified CSS files. It then compresses the content using the csscompressor library, optionally inserting line breaks. Output is either written to a specified file or printed. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is evident. Usage of external libraries is benign, and no anomalous code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate CSS compression task with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles file input/output and does not contain suspicious or harmful code segments.",
