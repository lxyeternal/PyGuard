{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to compress CSS files using the csscompressor library, with options for line-breaking and output redirection.",
  "sources": "The code reads input file paths from command line arguments and reads their contents from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code writes compressed CSS output either to a specified output file or to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input file paths (sources) are read and their contents stored in memory; then, the combined data is processed by csscompressor.compress (sink), and the result is written to a file or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code straightforwardly handles file input/output and uses a third-party library for CSS compression.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for argument parsing and a third-party CSS compressor. It defines functions to parse command-line arguments, read input files, and output the compressed CSS. No user input is executed as code, nor are there evident injection vectors or network operations. The code simply reads files, processes data, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The only potential concern could be reading untrusted files, but this is typical for a command-line utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CSS compression utility with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It performs file I/O and uses a legitimate library for compression. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
