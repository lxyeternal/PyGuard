{
  "purpose": "The script compresses CSS files by reading input files, compressing their content, and outputting the result either to a file or stdout.",
  "sources": "Input files specified via command-line arguments (positional 'input' files).",
  "sinks": "Writing compressed output to a specified output file or printing to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> concatenates content -> compresses with csscompressor -> writes output to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or code that manipulates environment variables or system resources maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to specify input CSS files, optional line break settings, and output destination. It reads each input file in text mode, concatenates their contents, and passes the combined content to 'csscompressor.compress()' with optional line length limits. The output is then written to a file or printed. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data are present. The script relies on the 'csscompressor' library, which appears standard for CSS compression tasks. Overall, the code performs a straightforward file processing task without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CSS compressor utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles files securely and uses standard libraries appropriately. No malware or security threats are identified.",
