{
  "purpose": "The script compresses CSS files by reading input files, optionally inserting line breaks, and outputting the compressed CSS either to a file or stdout.",
  "sources": "File inputs specified via command-line arguments (args.input), environment variables are not directly used, but the files are read directly from disk.",
  "sinks": "The output is written either to a specified file or printed to stdout. The compress function processes the data read from input files.",
  "flows": "Input files are read (source), passed into csscompressor.compress() (processing), and output to file or stdout (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The script performs standard file reading, command-line parsing, and CSS compression.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file input, CSS compression using a well-known library, and output operations. It does not contain any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. The license comment and straightforward logic indicate no hidden or malicious intent. The CSS compressor library used is open-source and commonly employed for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CSS compression utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads input files, compresses CSS, and outputs the result. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
