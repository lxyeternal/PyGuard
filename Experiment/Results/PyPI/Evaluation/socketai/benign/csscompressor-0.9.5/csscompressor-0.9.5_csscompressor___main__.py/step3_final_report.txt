  "purpose": "A command-line utility that reads CSS files, optionally inserts line breaks, compresses the CSS using csscompressor, and outputs the result.",
  "sources": "File reads from specified input files",
  "sinks": "Writing compressed CSS to output file or stdout",
  "flows": "Reading files -> concatenating content -> compressing via csscompressor.compress() -> outputting to file or stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CSS compressor utility. It reads input files, concatenates their contents, compresses using a well-known library, and outputs the result. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear and standard. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns. The risk is minimal, primarily due to file handling, which is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It functions as a standard CSS compression utility. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Minor adjustment could be made to the security risk score to 0, but 0.1 remains reasonable.",
