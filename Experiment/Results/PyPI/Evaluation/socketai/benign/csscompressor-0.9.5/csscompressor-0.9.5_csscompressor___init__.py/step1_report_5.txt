{
  "purpose": "CSS minification and compression, including syntax normalization and color shortening, for optimizing CSS files.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS stylesheet strings, pattern matching for URLs, color values, comments, strings, and CSS rules.",
  "sinks": "Manipulates CSS strings, replaces tokens, preserves parts of CSS, and outputs compressed CSS; no external data sinks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input CSS → Preserves tokens, comments, strings → Modifies CSS with regex replacements → Restores preserved tokens → Outputs compressed CSS.",
  "anomalies": "Uses complex regex-based token preservation and replacements; no obvious malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external data exfiltration observed. No obfuscated code detected; logic is consistent with CSS minification.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively uses regex to parse and modify CSS for minification purposes. It preserves comments and strings to avoid corruption, performs color and spacing optimizations, and handles CSS-specific syntax nuances. No external network operations, system modifications, or suspicious data handling is present. The code is complex but consistent with CSS minification tools and does not exhibit malicious patterns or sabotage indications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CSS minification library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Its complexity is consistent with CSS processing and does not include suspicious network or system operations.",
