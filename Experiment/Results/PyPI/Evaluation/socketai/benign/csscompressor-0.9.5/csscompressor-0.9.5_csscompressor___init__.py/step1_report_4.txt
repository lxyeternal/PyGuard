  "purpose": "The code is designed to minify and compress CSS stylesheets by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and simplifying color representations, while preserving certain comments and tokens as specified.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS stylesheet string input; reads comments, string literals, and specific CSS patterns via regex matches.",
  "sinks": "Replaces tokens with original content during the restoration phase; manipulates CSS content for compression; transforms color formats; outputs minified CSS string.",
  "flows": "CSS input -> preservation of calls and strings -> regex-based replacements and modifications -> preservation tokens -> final output with tokens replaced back to original content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Code primarily performs CSS minification. Use of regex for pattern matching is extensive but appears to serve compression purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively uses regular expressions to identify and manipulate CSS patterns for minification. It preserves certain comments and string tokens during processing to avoid corruption. It converts rgb() colors to hex, shortens hex colors, compresses color keywords, removes whitespace, and simplifies CSS rules. No code indicates external network access, data exfiltration, or backdoor behaviors. Functions are internally focused on string manipulation for CSS compression. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate CSS minifier with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a CSS compressor/minifier designed for performance optimization and file size reduction. It does not contain any indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All operations are confined to string processing for CSS content. No malicious signals or anomalies were identified.",
