  "purpose": "CSS minifier that compresses CSS code by removing whitespace, comments, shortening colors, and optimizing CSS constructs while preserving strings and comments as needed.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS code strings, including comments, strings, color definitions, and CSS rules via regex pattern matching and string operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network calls; processes CSS text internally without external dependencies.",
  "flows": "Token preservation of strings/comments -> regex-based pattern replacements (colors, whitespace, comments) -> token restoration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; uses standard regex techniques for CSS optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard CSS minifier, employing regex to preserve tokens and then perform transformations such as color shortening, whitespace removal, and comment handling. No external calls, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are evident. The regex complexity is typical for such tools and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CSS minifier with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by the regex-based processing, which is standard for CSS optimization tools. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
