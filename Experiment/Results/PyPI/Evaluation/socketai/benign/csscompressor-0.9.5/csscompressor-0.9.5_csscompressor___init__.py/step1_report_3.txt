{
  "purpose": "This code is a CSS minifier and compressor designed to optimize CSS stylesheets by removing unnecessary characters, whitespace, comments, and simplifying color and property values.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS code input as strings; extracts CSS components such as URLs, comments, strings, and functions using regular expressions; processes CSS content for compression.",
  "sinks": "Modifies CSS code in-place, including replacing color formats, removing comments, compressing rules, and reconstructing CSS with altered tokens; uses string operations and regex substitutions to produce minimized CSS.",
  "flows": "CSS input -> regex-based token preservation -> comment and string processing -> CSS content transformations (color shortening, whitespace reduction, rule shortening) -> preservation restoration -> output CSS",
  "anomalies": "Uses token preservation to protect certain CSS parts; no hardcoded credentials, no network communication, and no execution of untrusted input; code appears solely focused on CSS text manipulation. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple regular expressions for parsing and transforming CSS, focusing on compression and optimization. It preserves certain tokens (like URLs and comments) to prevent corruption of CSS syntax during transformations. The functions perform standard CSS minification tasks such as color shortening, comment removal, whitespace normalization, and rule compression. The code does not include any network operations, system calls, or external command executions. It operates solely on string data, with no evident malicious logic or backdoors. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors are detected. Its sole purpose appears to be CSS optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a CSS minification utility with no malicious intent. It performs standard compression tasks using regex and string operations, with token preservation mechanisms to avoid corrupting CSS syntax. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain threats are evident.",
