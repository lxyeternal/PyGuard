  "purpose": "The code is a CSS minifier designed to compress and optimize CSS stylesheets by removing unnecessary characters, whitespace, comments, and shortening color values.",
  "sources": "Input CSS string provided to the 'compress' or 'compress_partitioned' functions.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the CSS string, replacing parts of it (e.g., URLs, comments, strings) and reassembling it, but does not write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input CSS string → _compress() processes and transforms CSS (preserving tokens, removing comments, minifying) → _apply_preserved() restores preserved tokens → output CSS string.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of regex-based token preservation to handle strings and comments; no suspicious or obfuscated code; code comments and structure indicate purpose as a CSS compressor.",
  "analysis": "The code is a sophisticated CSS minifier that carefully preserves string and comment content during minification using tokenization, then restores them afterward. It includes multiple regex patterns for CSS constructs and colors, with functions for shortening colors, removing whitespace, comments, and redundant syntax. No network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The code aims solely at CSS compression without any malicious side effects or hidden functionalities. It does not access environment variables, system files, or external systems, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a CSS minification utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions solely to compress CSS code efficiently, preserving necessary content. The code is well-structured, and all processing appears safe and legitimate.",
