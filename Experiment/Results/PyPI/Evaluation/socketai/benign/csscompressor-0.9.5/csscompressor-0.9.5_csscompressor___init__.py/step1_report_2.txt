{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to minify and compress CSS stylesheets by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and shortening color representations, with additional handling for preserving certain comments and tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads CSS stylesheet strings, including comments, strings, and CSS rules. It also reads internal regex patterns for matching specific CSS constructs.",
  "sinks": "Transforms CSS strings by replacing color values, comments, and other CSS components. Uses string replacements and regex substitutions to produce compressed output.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (CSS string) → preservation of tokens/comments/strings → pattern matching and replacement (colors, whitespace, comments) → reassembly into compressed CSS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard regex patterns and string manipulations typical of CSS minifiers. No obfuscated or suspicious code features. No external network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a CSS minifier, utilizing regex to identify and replace patterns for optimization. It preserves comments selectively and handles string preservation to avoid corrupting data. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise, are evident. The code relies on regex pattern matching and string processing without dynamic code execution or obfuscated techniques. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate, safe CSS minification library.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a CSS minifier with no malicious intent, functioning solely to optimize CSS files by removing unnecessary data. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its security risk score is very low, and confidence in the assessment is high.",
