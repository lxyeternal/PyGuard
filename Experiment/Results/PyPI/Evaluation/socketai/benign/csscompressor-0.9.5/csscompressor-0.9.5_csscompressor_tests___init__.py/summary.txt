  "conclusion": "The reports are internally consistent and appropriately cautious. Suspicious patterns are recognized but not confirmed as malicious payloads. Scores reflect the level of suspicion, with no evidence of active malicious code. Slight increases in malware or obfuscation scores could be justified if more evidence emerges. Overall, the evaluations are reasonable given the available information."
