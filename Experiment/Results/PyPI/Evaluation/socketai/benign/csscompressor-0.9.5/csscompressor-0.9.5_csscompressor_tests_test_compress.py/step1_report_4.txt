  "purpose": "Unit tests for the csscompressor library, specifically testing the CSS compression functionality.",
  "sources": "Input CSS strings within test methods, especially the variables 'input'.",
  "sinks": "The 'compress' function call, which processes the input CSS string and returns compressed output.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings (sources) are passed to 'compress' (sink), which processes and returns compressed CSS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test suite for the csscompressor library, focusing on CSS compression features. It imports standard testing modules and the library functions. The tests check for proper compression, handling of errors, and nested CSS calculations. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity. The functions merely test the CSS compressor behavior with various inputs and expected outputs. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard unit testing code for the csscompressor library with no malicious behavior detected. It simply verifies CSS compression functionality. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
