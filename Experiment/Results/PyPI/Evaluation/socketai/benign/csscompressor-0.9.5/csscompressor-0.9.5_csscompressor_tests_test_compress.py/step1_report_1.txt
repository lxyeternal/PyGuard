  "purpose": "Unit tests for the csscompressor library, specifically testing the CSS compression functionality and handling of edge cases.",
  "sources": "Input CSS strings provided directly within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data; all data is hardcoded in the test cases.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; tests process static strings and do not involve external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears to be standard unit testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing modules and the csscompressor library, then defines a class with multiple unit tests verifying CSS compression and error handling. All input data are static strings, and there are no network operations, file I/O, or other potential security concerns. The code's structure and content are consistent with typical test code. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for a CSS compressor library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is standard test code meant for verifying functionality. No security concerns or malware signals are present.",
