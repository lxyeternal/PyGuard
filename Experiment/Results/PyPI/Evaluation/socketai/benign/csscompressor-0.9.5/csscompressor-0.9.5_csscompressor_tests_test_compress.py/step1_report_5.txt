{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the csscompressor library, specifically testing the 'compress' function with various CSS inputs.",
  "sources": "Input CSS strings provided directly within test methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'compress' function potentially processes untrusted CSS input; no direct sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings → compress function → output string (possibly compressed CSS).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard test cases for CSS compression with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and the 'compress' function from the 'csscompressor' package, then defines multiple test cases for CSS compression. Each test case provides CSS input, calls 'compress', and asserts expected output or behavior. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no manipulation of environment variables are present. The code is straightforward, intended for testing purposes, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a CSS compressor library with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
