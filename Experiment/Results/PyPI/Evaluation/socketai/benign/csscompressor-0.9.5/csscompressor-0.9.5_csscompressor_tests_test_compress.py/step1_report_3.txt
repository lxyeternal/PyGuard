  "purpose": "Unit tests for the csscompressor library, verifying CSS compression functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries, test input strings, and assertions within test methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and function calls to 'compress' that process CSS input strings.",
  "flows": "Test inputs are passed to 'compress'; outputs are compared against expected results or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; standard unit test structure. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of unit tests for a CSS compressor library, including input validation and edge cases. It uses standard unittest framework constructs. No evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The tests are straightforward and serve to verify CSS compression features. The import statements and test assertions are typical for testing purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for the csscompressor library with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is focused solely on verifying CSS compression functionality.",
