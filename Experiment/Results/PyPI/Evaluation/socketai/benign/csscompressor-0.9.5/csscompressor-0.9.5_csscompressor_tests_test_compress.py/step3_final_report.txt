  "purpose": "Unit tests for the csscompressor library to verify CSS compression functionality, error handling, and nested calculations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded CSS strings within test methods; no external data sources or dynamic inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; tests operate on static input data without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static, well-structured unit tests for the csscompressor library. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain any obfuscated or malicious code. The tests verify compression correctness and error handling with controlled inputs. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and accurate.",
