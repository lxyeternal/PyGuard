  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description, importing 'setuptools', conditional import of 'argparse'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file feeds data into 'extra['long_description']', conditional import affects dependencies list, 'setup' function uses collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a README file and handling optional dependencies. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. It uses common patterns for package setup without any obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
