{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution settings for the 'csscompressor' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description, importing 'argparse' module, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code primarily reads static files and sets package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> setting package info -> defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections detected. The code uses standard packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file to include a long description, conditionally adds 'argparse' as a dependency if not available, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to follow standard Python packaging conventions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
