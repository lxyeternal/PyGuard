{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test class for verifying the functionality of the 'csscompressor' library's 'compress' function, likely used for CSS minification.",
  "sources": "The code reads static input data from the '_test' method parameters. It does not read external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the '_test' method inputs through the 'compress' function, then compares the result to expected output. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to be a unit test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known CSS compression library and defines a unit test class with a method that tests the compressor. The method compares the compressor's output against expected output and prints detailed information if they differ. No external data sources, network connections, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for a CSS compressor library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
