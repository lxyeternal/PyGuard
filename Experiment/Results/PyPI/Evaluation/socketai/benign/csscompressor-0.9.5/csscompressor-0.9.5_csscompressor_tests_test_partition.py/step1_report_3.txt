{
  "purpose": "The code contains test cases for the 'csscompressor' library's 'compress_partitioned' function, verifying its behavior with various CSS inputs and partitioning rules.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSS input strings directly defined within test functions; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects; the code only processes in-memory strings and asserts expected output.",
  "flows": "The source CSS strings are passed to 'compress_partitioned', which processes and returns compressed CSS outputs; no untrusted data flows into critical system components or external resources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present; the code strictly performs unit testing for CSS compression logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CSS compression library and defines multiple test cases to verify its functionality. It uses in-memory CSS strings to test different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions, such as malformed media queries and complex rule sets. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or secret exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be standard test code for a CSS compressor, with no suspicious code patterns, network operations, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing the 'compress_partitioned' function of the 'csscompressor' library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It is standard test code intended for verifying CSS compression logic.",
