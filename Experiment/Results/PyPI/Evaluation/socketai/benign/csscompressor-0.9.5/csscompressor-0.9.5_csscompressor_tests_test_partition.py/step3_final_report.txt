{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'compress_partitioned' function from the 'csscompressor' library, verifying CSS partitioning and compression logic with various static CSS inputs.",
  "sources": "Static CSS strings within test cases, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on function outputs and exception handling; no untrusted data flow or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings processed directly by 'compress_partitioned', with results compared to expected outputs or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "None; tests are straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing suite for CSS compression, involving static data and assertions. No external interactions, malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests cover normal and malformed CSS inputs, primarily to verify correct behavior and error handling. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, non-malicious test suite with no security risks or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
