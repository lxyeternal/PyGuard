{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for the csscompressor library, specifically testing the 'compress_partitioned' function's behavior with various CSS inputs and partitioning parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables defined within test methods as input data for CSS compression.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, files, or network; it only processes input strings and asserts expected output.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed directly to 'compress_partitioned' function; no external data or untrusted sources are involved, and no data leaks or external effects are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward unit test code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing modules and the 'compress_partitioned' function from csscompressor. It defines a 'Tests' class with multiple test methods, each testing different CSS input scenarios. The inputs are static CSS strings; some tests expect specific output strings, while others check for exceptions. There are no dynamic code execution, external data sources, or side effects. The code is consistent with standard unit testing practices and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for CSS compression functionality, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs in-memory tests without interacting with external systems or handling untrusted input beyond the test inputs themselves.",
