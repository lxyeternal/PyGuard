{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests for a CSS compressor, testing specific issues related to CSS minification.",
  "sources": "The code reads static CSS input strings defined within the test methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or output data; it only compares input and output strings within a controlled testing environment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined input strings to the output verification via the testing functions; no untrusted data input or network operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections. The code strictly performs CSS minification tests with static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base test class and defines a test class with multiple test methods, each testing specific CSS minification issues from a known repository. It uses static CSS inputs and compares the minified output. No external data sources, network communication, or malicious logic is present. The code structure and content are straightforward and typical for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a CSS compressor, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code is safe and purely focused on testing CSS minification functionality.",
