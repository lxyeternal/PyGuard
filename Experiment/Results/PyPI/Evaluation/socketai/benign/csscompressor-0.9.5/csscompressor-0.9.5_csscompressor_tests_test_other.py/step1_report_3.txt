  "purpose": "Unit tests for CSS compression and formatting, specifically testing issues related to CSS minification and compatibility.",
  "sources": "Test input strings containing CSS code; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code performs string manipulations for testing purposes only.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings are processed and compared to expected output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward testing code with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a test base class and defines a test suite with multiple test cases that verify CSS minification. All code constructs are standard for unit testing. There are no network operations, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears solely for testing CSS compression issues, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for CSS minification, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
