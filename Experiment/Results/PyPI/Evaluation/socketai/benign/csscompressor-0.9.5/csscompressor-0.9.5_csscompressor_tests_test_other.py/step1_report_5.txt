{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for CSS compressor functionality, specifically testing CSS minification and bug fixes.",
  "sources": "Input CSS strings in test methods, no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings are processed and transformed into minified output within the test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; code is straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base test class and defines several test methods to verify CSS minification. Each method contains CSS input strings and expected output strings, and calls a test helper. No data is read from external sources, nor is any untrusted data processed or transmitted. The code does not perform any system operations, network activities, or contain code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. It strictly performs unit testing for a CSS compressor utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for CSS minification functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, simple, and does not interact with external systems beyond testing inputs and outputs.",
