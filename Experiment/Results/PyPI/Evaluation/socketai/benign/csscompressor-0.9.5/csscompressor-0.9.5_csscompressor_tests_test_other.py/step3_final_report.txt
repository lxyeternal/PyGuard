{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for a CSS compressor, verifying that specific CSS inputs are correctly minified to expected outputs.",
  "sources": "Static CSS strings within test methods, no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code only compares static input to expected output within the test framework.",
  "flows": "Input CSS strings are processed by the compressor (implied in the test), and the output is compared to expected minified strings; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with static CSS data and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that check CSS minification. It uses static, hardcoded CSS snippets and verifies their minified form. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not perform any malicious actions, contain obfuscated code, or handle untrusted input. The purpose is solely to test CSS compression correctness. All signals indicate benign, safe code. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite for CSS minification with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
