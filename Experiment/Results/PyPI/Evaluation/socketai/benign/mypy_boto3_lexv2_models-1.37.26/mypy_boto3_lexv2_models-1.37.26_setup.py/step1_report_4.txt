  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-lexv2-models library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; gathers package metadata from static code; specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network, file, or external command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file -> uses setuptools.setup() with static parameters -> no flow of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for file handling, reads a static README.md file for description, and calls setup() with predefined static parameters. All data used is hardcoded or derived from static files. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed at runtime. No suspicious network activity, command execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
