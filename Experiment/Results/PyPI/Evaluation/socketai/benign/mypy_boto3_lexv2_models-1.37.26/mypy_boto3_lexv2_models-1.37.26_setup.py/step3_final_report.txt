  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging of the mypy-boto3-lexv2-models Python library, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls to setup() with static parameters; no data sinks or external data flows; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration without untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code reads a local README file and calls setup() with static metadata, which is safe. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
