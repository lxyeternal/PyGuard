{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-lexv2-models package, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "Reads local file (README.md) to include as long_description in setup configuration; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no external connections.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static package metadata. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup. No user input, no network activity, and no execution of external or untrusted code. The presence of comments and structure is typical. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads a file and invokes setup() with static parameters.",
