  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-lexv2-models Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, standard setup parameters for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or sent to external sources.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content, processes package setup configuration. No external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The code performs standard setup tasks without dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib for file handling and setuptools for package setup. It reads a README.md file for the long description, then calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters such as package name, version, URLs, author info, classifiers, and dependencies. The dependencies are minimal and conditional, with no user input or external data handling. The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly performs package configuration and metadata definition.",
