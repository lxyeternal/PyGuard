{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for lexv2-models service client waiters, providing structured waiting mechanisms for various LexV2 model states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module. Class methods that accept **kwargs unpacked with specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No insecure sinks detected; the code defines class structures and method signatures without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Class wait methods accept **kwargs with specified types, but do not process untrusted input directly. The flow is mainly class inheritance and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. The code is straightforward class and method definitions with no data manipulation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type-annotated subclasses of Waiter with overridden wait methods that accept specific keyword arguments. The wait methods are documented with links to AWS and boto3-stubs documentation but do not contain executable logic beyond method signatures. No data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns are present. All code aligns with standard SDK extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type-annotated waiter class definitions for AWS LexV2 models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a type-safe interface layer for AWS SDK waiters, without executing untrusted or malicious code.",
