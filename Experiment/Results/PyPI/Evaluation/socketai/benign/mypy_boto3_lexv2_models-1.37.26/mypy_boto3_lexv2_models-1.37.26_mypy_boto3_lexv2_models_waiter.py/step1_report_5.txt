{
  "purpose": "Define waiters for various AWS LexV2 models using boto3, with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and custom type definitions; class methods that accept kwargs for waiting on AWS resources.",
  "sinks": "Kwargs unpacked from type definitions passed to wait() methods, which are used internally by boto3 to poll AWS services.",
  "flows": "Method calls to self.wait() passing unpacked kwargs from type definitions, which likely translate to API call parameters for polling AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard AWS waiters implementation with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines waiter subclasses for AWS LexV2 resources, providing type-safe wait methods with detailed documentation links. Imports are standard, and the wait methods accept kwargs typed from imported definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious network activities are present. The structure aligns with typical boto3-stubs patterns for enhancing type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, type-annotated implementation of AWS waiters for LexV2 models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates waiting on AWS resource states with type safety. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
