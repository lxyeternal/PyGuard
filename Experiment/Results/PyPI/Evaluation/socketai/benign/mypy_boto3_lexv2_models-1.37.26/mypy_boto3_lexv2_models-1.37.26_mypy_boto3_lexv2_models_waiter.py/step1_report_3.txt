{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for asynchronous resource state polling in the boto3 lexv2-models service client, providing type annotations for better static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods do not perform untrusted data handling; they invoke base class methods with annotated parameters.",
  "flows": "The wait() methods pass unpacked kwargs to the base Waiter.wait() method, based on the provided type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly defines type-annotated wrapper classes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for waiters inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, with methods that accept specific typed kwargs. The type annotations are derived from imported type_defs, intended to facilitate type checking and static analysis. No external inputs, data leaks, network activity, or code execution are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. All code appears to be standard, well-structured, and solely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines typed subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter for the lexv2-models service, enabling better static type checking and documentation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
