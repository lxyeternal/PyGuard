  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as defining type annotations and waiter classes for lexv2-models, with imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific types but do not process untrusted data directly. The flow is standard class inheritance and method signatures.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no data leaks, no external calls beyond class definitions. The code is purely for static typing and documentation.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for type safety.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, no signs of malicious activity. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—defining typed waiter classes with imports and method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, which are passed to the parent Waiter.wait().  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard SDK extension. The **kwargs are expected to be passed to the underlying AWS SDK's wait() method, which is safe if used correctly.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard pattern, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues, purely type annotations and class structures.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiter subclasses with type annotations for better static analysis.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to above, with wait() accepting typed kwargs.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external code execution, no obfuscation. The code is for static typing and SDK wrapping.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity, safe for inclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines waiter classes for AWS LexV2 with type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept kwargs unpacked from type definitions, passed to the base class.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, no external calls.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK wrapper classes.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns, purely for static typing and documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—defining waiters with type annotations and documentation links.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses kwargs unpacked from type definitions, passed to the parent wait() method.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK extension code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports describe code that defines subclasses of `botocore.waiter.Waiter` with properly annotated `wait()` methods. These methods accept kwargs typed via imported type definitions, mainly for static analysis and documentation purposes.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external command execution.\n\n- **Security Risks:** None detected. The code is purely structural, intended for SDK type safety and documentation.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard, well-structured, and serves as a type-safe wrapper for AWS SDK waiters. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
