  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and waiter class definitions, importing from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wait methods accept **kwargs with specific types, passed to parent Waiter.wait().  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward class inheritance and method signatures.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, serving as a type-safe interface layer.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of **kwargs is standard for SDK wrapper classes.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining waiter classes with type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wait methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, passed to Waiter.wait().  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK wrapper classes.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Accepting **kwargs in SDK wrappers is typical; no signs of malicious intent.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiter subclasses with type annotations, importing from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wait methods unpack kwargs with types, passing to base class.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation. The code is purely class definitions with type annotations.  \n- **Conclusion:** Serves as type-annotated wrappers, safe and standard.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is sound. The code is purely for static typing and documentation.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining waiter classes with type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wait methods accept kwargs, unpacked into requests.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The pattern is consistent with SDK type hints.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines waiter subclasses with documentation links and type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses kwargs unpacked into wait() calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code injection, or external calls.  \n- **Conclusion:** Straightforward, safe SDK pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical, well-structured SDK wrapper with type annotations. No malicious or security concerns.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports describe classes that extend `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with `wait()` methods accepting typed `**kwargs`.  \n- **Security & Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is purely for static typing, documentation, and SDK convenience.  \n- **Scores Justification:** The malware scores are correctly at 0, as there's no malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are 0, given the code clarity. Risk scores are 0, since no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**, as the code is benign and purely for type annotations and SDK support.\n\n**Additional note:** The code is standard for SDK type definitions and does not pose any security threat. The detailed documentation links and straightforward class structures further support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate in their evaluation; no changes needed.",
