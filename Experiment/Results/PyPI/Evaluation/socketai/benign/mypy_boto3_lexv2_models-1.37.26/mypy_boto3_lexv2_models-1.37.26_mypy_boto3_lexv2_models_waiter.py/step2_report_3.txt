  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines type annotations and waiter classes for LexV2 models, importing from sys, botocore, and local type_defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific types but do not process untrusted data beyond passing it to the parent class. The flow is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for SDK extension and type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence that the code is benign and purely for type annotations and class definitions.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; defining waiter classes with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept **kwargs, which are passed to the base class. No unsafe operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is standard SDK wrapper classes.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear that this is a safe, type-safe wrapper for AWS waiters.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter with typed wait() methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The methods accept typed kwargs and pass them to the parent. No data manipulation or external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard SDK extension code.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, defining waiter subclasses with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wait methods accept **kwargs with specific types, passed to the base class.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security risks detected.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; defining waiters with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept kwargs typed from imported definitions, passed to boto3's wait() internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard pattern for SDK waiters.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports describe class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None. The code is purely structural, serving as type-safe wrappers for AWS SDK waiters.\n- **Data leaks or external threats:** None. No external data processing or network activity occurs within these class definitions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Note:** Given the context, the code is a typical SDK extension for type safety, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and align with the actual analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for enhancing static analysis and documentation of AWS LexV2 waiter classes.",
