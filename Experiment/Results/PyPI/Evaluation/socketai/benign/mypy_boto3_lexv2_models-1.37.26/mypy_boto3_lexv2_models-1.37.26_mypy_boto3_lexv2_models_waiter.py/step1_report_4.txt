  "purpose": "Define waiter classes for various AWS LexV2 models, enabling wait operations with type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters using **kwargs with type annotations, potentially untrusted input from caller functions.",
  "flows": "Caller invokes wait() method, passing in untrusted data via **kwargs, which are unpacked into request types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No code injection or data leakage present. Use of type annotations and documentation links appears standard for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions inheriting from Waiter, with wait() methods accepting dynamically unpacked parameters typed with imported type definitions. It imports standard modules and conditionally imports Unpack from typing or typing_extensions. No external data sources, network calls, or potentially malicious code are present. The purpose aligns with SDK documentation for AWS waiters. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are observed. The code is consistent with a typical SDK type-annotated wrapper implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured set of waiter class definitions for AWS LexV2 models, primarily used for polling AWS resources until certain states are reached. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intended for use as part of a client SDK with proper type annotations.",
