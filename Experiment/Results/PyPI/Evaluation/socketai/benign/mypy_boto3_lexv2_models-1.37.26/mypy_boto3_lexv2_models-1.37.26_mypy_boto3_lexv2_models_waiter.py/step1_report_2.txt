  "purpose": "Define waiter classes for lexv2-models service client with type annotations for waiting on specific resource states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class methods using **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, which are passed to the parent Waiter.wait() method.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from **kwargs in wait() methods to the parent class Waiter.wait(), potentially affecting resource state checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. The code is standard for defining type-annotated waiters. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait() method accepting keyword arguments typed according to specific request wait types. The wait() methods are designed to be called with untrusted data (**kwargs). These methods do not perform any unsafe operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. No external network, file, or system modifications are present. The structure and imports are standard, and there are no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as type-safe wrapper classes for waiters in the boto3 lexv2-models service. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, safe, and purposefully designed for SDK typings.",
