{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and waiter classes for AWS LexV2 models, serving as static type-safe SDK wrappers.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; no external data processing or input reading.",
  "sinks": "wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific types, passed directly to parent class methods without processing.",
  "flows": "kwargs flow from method parameters to the base Waiter.wait() call; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard class inheritance and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of subclass definitions of botocore.waiter.Waiter with typed wait() methods accepting kwargs for static analysis. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely structural, aimed at providing type annotations for SDK waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static type annotation layer for AWS SDK waiters. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent.",
