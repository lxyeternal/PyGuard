  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code defines type annotations and waiter classes for LexV2 models, with imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs. No external or untrusted data processing.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific types but do not process untrusted data directly; they merely pass them to the parent class. No external calls or data leaks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard class inheritance and method signatures for SDK typings.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, serving as a type-safe interface layer. Confidence is high (0.9), and malware/obfuscation scores are zero.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the wait() methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, but do not perform unsafe operations. The code is standard for defining SDK wrappers with type annotations.\n\n- The analysis notes no external network, file, or malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on the purpose of providing type annotations for resource polling, with no unsafe data handling or external interactions. The wait() methods unpack kwargs based on imported types but do not process untrusted data maliciously.\n\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Highlights the purpose as SDK type annotations, with no external or unsafe code. The wait() methods accept kwargs typed with imported definitions, standard for SDK type safety.\n\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, describing waiter subclasses with type annotations, documentation links, and standard import patterns. No external or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports describe the same pattern: class definitions for waiters with type annotations, no actual execution or data processing beyond method signatures.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code in any report.\n\n- **Security risk:** The code is purely structural, meant for static typing and documentation, with no external calls, data leaks, or unsafe operations.\n\n- **Score consistency:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is benign SDK wrapper definitions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard, type-annotated set of SDK waiter class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
