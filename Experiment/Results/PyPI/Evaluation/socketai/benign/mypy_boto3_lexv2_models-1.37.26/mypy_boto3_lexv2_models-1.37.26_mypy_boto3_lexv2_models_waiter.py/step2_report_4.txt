  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the code for potential security issues, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and waiter class definitions for LexV2 models. The code is straightforward, importing necessary modules and defining subclasses of Waiter with wait methods accepting **kwargs with specific types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait methods accept **kwargs, which are passed to the parent Waiter.wait(). No data processing or external commands are executed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is standard for SDK extension.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, serving as a type-safe interface layer. No malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is safe. The **malware** score should remain at **0**. The **obfuscated** score is **0**. The **risk** score, reflecting potential misuse, should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining waiter classes with type annotations. The wait methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs but do not process it unsafely.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The kwargs are passed to the base class method, which is standard behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is typical for SDK wrappers.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard, and purposefully designed for static typing.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware. The **malware** score remains **0**. The **risk** score should stay at **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines typed subclasses for waiters, with wait methods accepting specific typed kwargs. No external or unsafe operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to previous reports, passing kwargs to base class methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for type annotations and static analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score: **0**. Obfuscated: **0**. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, with class definitions and typed wait methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait methods accept kwargs with specific types, passed to the parent wait().\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK wrapper code.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware: **0**. Obfuscated: **0**. Risk: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar class definitions, with detailed documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The wait methods unpack kwargs for internal API calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe, and purpose-built for AWS SDK static typing.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware: **0**. Obfuscated: **0**. Risk: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe class definitions for AWS SDK waiters, with type annotations and no executable or unsafe code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected; the code is purely for static typing and documentation purposes.\n- **Scores:** The reported malware scores are all **0**, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports, as there is no potential for security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves as a static type annotation layer for AWS LexV2 waiters. No changes to scores are necessary.",
