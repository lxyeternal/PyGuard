  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for the lexv2-models service, including request/response structures, settings, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Type definitions for data structures, request/response schemas, and configuration objects within the lexv2-models service.",
  "sinks": "No execution sinks or untrusted data processing functions are present; primarily data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing logic; only static type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive information. No unusual or obfuscated code patterns. No dynamic code execution or network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains Python type annotations, class definitions using TypedDict, Union types, and conditional imports based on Python version. All elements are static data structure definitions intended for type safety and clarity. There are no executable or runtime behaviors, no string evals, no code injections, and no external resource accesses or network operations. The inclusion of licensing and documentation comments does not introduce any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a service API, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely declarative and used for type safety, with no execution or data leakage vectors.",
