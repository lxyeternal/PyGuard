  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of static type annotations using Python's `TypedDict`, `Union`, `Literal`, and conditional imports based on Python version. There are no executable functions, dynamic code, or data processing logic. The type definitions serve as data schemas for request/response validation in an SDK or API client.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly state \"Empty response\" with no additional details. They describe the purpose as defining data structures and note the absence of dynamic or executable code, which is accurate. They correctly conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent with the static nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: Reporters assign `0`. Given the static, declarative nature of the code, this is appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Also `0`, which is correct since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Risk Score**: `0` is justified because the code does not perform any operations, handle untrusted data at runtime, or include any suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that this is purely type annotation code with no executable or network behavior.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code uses standard Python typing practices and conditional imports, which are safe and common in SDKs.  \n   - No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are embedded.  \n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Summary & Final Estimation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API schema, with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nBased on the provided code and the reports, I agree with the assessments. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The static type annotations are standard and safe.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note**: The reports' \"Empty response\" entries are consistent with the fact that this is purely type annotation code, which inherently contains no executable or malicious content.",
