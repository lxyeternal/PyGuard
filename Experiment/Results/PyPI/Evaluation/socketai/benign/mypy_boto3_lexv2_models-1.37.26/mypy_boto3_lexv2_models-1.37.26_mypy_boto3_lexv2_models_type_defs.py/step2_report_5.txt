  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Issue Presence in Code:**  \n   - The reports indicate \"Empty response\" errors, which suggest no actual content or code was included in those reports.  \n   - The provided code is a large set of static type annotations, class definitions, and data models for the lexv2-models service.  \n   - No dynamic code, executable logic, or external interactions are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**  \n   - The reports do not identify any logical flaws or suspicious patterns.  \n   - They correctly interpret the code as purely static type annotations, with no executable or malicious content.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** Given the static nature of the code—only type definitions and data models—there's no indication of malicious behavior. The malware score should be **0**.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, using standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports, and no obfuscation techniques. The obfuscated score should be **0**.  \n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code contains no executable logic, no dynamic code, no secrets, and no network activity, the overall security risk is minimal. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as purely declarative type annotations.  \n   - No suspicious patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious imports, are present.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - The scores suggested by the reports are all \"0\" for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a comprehensive, static set of type annotations and data models for an SDK or API client. It contains no executable logic, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores should reflect that.\n\n**Confidence level:** 1 (high certainty)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, well-structured static type definition file with no security concerns.",
