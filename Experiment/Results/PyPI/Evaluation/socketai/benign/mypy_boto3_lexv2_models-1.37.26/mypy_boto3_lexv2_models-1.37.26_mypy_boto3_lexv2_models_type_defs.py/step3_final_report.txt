{
  "purpose": "Static type definitions for lexv2-models service, defining data schemas for requests and responses using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and data schemas; no runtime data handling or executable code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; purely declarative type definitions with no runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution; only static schema declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear type annotations and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions, data models, and conditional imports for compatibility. No functions, dynamic code, or network interactions are present. The reports indicate 'Empty response' and do not identify any issues. Given the static, declarative nature, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of static type annotations serving as data schemas for an SDK or API. It contains no executable logic, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation. The assessments and scores are correct and should remain as is.",
