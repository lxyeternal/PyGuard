  "review": "Let's analyze the provided supply chain security reports carefully, focusing on potential issues, anomalies, and the consistency of the scoring.\n\n**Summary of findings from the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static collection of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`.\n- The code imports `sys` to conditionally import `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- The code contains only constant string definitions for various identifiers, statuses, and categories used in AWS LexV2 models and other AWS services.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or runtime behaviors are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The only unusual aspect noted is a future copyright date (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n**Security and malware assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely static type alias definitions for type safety and documentation.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or data processing.\n- No network calls, credential handling, or code execution.\n- No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- No signs of malicious intent, such as embedded backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nGiven the above, the current scores seem accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — The code is a static type definition module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The future date (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n- The code's purpose is solely to provide type safety, with no runtime impact or external dependencies.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**If I were to assign my own estimates based on this analysis:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the reports' findings.",
