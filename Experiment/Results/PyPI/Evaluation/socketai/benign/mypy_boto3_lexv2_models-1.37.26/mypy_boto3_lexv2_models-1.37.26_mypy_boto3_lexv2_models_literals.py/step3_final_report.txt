{
  "purpose": "Define static type aliases for AWS LexV2 models and other AWS services using Python's Literal for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for identifiers, statuses, categories, and service names; conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions do not process untrusted data or perform runtime actions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or runtime execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but likely a placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module providing type aliases via Literal, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, justified by the static, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This supply chain component is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
