  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a static set of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`.\n   - No dynamic code, external calls, or data processing are present.\n   - The code imports `sys` to conditionally import `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - The only minor note is the mention of a future copyright date (2025) in report 4, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the conclusion that the code is safe.\n   - The reports' confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5; all are 0.\n   - Given the static, non-executable nature of the code, this is correct.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward static analysis.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the assessments are accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is purely a static type definition module for Python, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores and assessments are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a safe, static type hinting module with no security concerns.",
