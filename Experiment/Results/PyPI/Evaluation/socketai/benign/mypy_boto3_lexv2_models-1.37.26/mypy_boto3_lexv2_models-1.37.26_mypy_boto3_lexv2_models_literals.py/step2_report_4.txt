  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a static collection of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal` for type safety.\n- They highlight the use of conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- The code contains no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, no network activity, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright date set to 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.\n- All reports confidently state that the code is benign, serving solely for type annotations and static type checking.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Data Flow:**  \n   - No input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - Purely static definitions, constants, and type aliases.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators:**  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No network or file I/O.\n   - No obfuscation or code injection.\n\n3. **Potential Concerns:**  \n   - The future date (2025) in the copyright is unusual but likely a placeholder.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**  \n   - Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as code is straightforward and readable.\n   - Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n   - Risk score: 0.5 or higher is not warranted; the code poses no security threat.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a static, well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS LexV2 service, intended for type safety and clarity.\n- No malicious behavior, no external dependencies or network activity, no obfuscation.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.0        |\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- No changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis supply chain dependency is a benign, static type hinting module with no security concerns. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
