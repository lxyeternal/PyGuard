{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for type annotations used in the lexv2-models service and related AWS services.",
  "sources": "Constant string values assigned to type variables, imported modules for version checking.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data input present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines type literals and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is purely for type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then defines numerous string literal types for various AWS Lex and general AWS service identifiers. No external input, network calls, or dynamic execution occurs. The structure is static, used solely for type safety and documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for improved type checking in Python, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static type hinting module, and its content is safe.",
