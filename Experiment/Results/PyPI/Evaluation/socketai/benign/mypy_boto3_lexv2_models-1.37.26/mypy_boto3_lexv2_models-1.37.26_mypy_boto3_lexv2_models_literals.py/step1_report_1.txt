{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various identifiers, statuses, and categories used in the lexv2-models service for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for type annotations, imported sys module for version check.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing; purely type definition assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to determine Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines numerous string literal type aliases used for type safety in the service. The code consists entirely of static type annotations and constant definitions. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. All content appears to be standard for type hinting purposes, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of type alias definitions using Python's Literal for type safety and code clarity. There is no malicious behavior, no external network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. It serves as a static type hinting module for the lexv2-models service.",
