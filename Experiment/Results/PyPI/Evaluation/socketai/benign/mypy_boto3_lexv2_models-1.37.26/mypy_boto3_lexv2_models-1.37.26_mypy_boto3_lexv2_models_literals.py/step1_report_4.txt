  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the lexv2-models service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from the 'typing' module or 'typing_extensions' for Python versions earlier than 3.12.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright notice with an unusual future date (2025), which may be a typo or placeholder. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a comprehensive set of type literals for various service-related identifiers. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, file handling, or data processing. The purpose is purely to define constants for type safety, with no suspicious or malicious logic. The inclusion of a future date in the copyright is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations for use in type checking. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The only minor concern is the future copyright date, likely a placeholder or typo.",
