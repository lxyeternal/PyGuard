  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various identifiers, statuses, and categories used in the boto3 lexv2-models service for type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing beyond static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code consists solely of type alias definitions and a version check.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with a docstring describing purpose and usage, then conditionally imports Literal for compatibility. It then defines numerous type aliases as Literal strings, representing various enums or constants used within the AWS LexV2 service. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or potential malicious constructs are present. All content is static type annotations, and no code execution or data processing occurs beyond static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type alias definitions for AWS LexV2 service, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for type hinting and does not contain executable logic or external data interactions.",
