  "purpose": "Define type aliases for string literals used in the lexv2-models service to ensure type safety and better code documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for various types, imported modules for conditional type import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data sources; only static string literal definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward type alias declarations and conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal types for various string constants, primarily for API parameters and identifiers. It includes a conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. The structure is static, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or user input processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears solely to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of string literal type aliases for improved type safety and documentation. There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
