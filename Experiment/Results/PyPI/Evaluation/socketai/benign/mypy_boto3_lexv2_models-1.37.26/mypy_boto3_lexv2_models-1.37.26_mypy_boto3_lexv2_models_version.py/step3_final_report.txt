  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = '1.37.26'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external data or inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, accompanied by a comment. It contains no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for package versioning and poses no threat. All previous reports correctly identified this as benign with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
