  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a comment. There are no inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n   - The code serves solely as metadata for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of any security risks, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence` = 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string declaration with no external interactions, the risk should remain at 0.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code poses no security concern.",
