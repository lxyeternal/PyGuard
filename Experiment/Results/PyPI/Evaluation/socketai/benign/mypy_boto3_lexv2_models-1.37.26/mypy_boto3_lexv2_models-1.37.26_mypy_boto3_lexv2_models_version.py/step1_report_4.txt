  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable with a static string value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external dependencies, and no malicious or suspicious constructs. The version number appears valid, and the code is minimal and standard for Python package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to define a version string for the package. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
