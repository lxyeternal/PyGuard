  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a comment. There are no inputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behaviors, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in these summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden payloads.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a standard version declaration.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of the code's actual behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n   - The uniformity supports the conclusion that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (no security issues)\n- **Overall Risk:** Minimal, as expected for such a simple, static assignment.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward version string declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and confirms that the code is benign.",
