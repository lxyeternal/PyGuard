  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to the console.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing (source: sys.argv) leads to printing version or info (sink: sys.stdout), with no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The script performs simple informational output.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and handles a command-line argument to display version info. The logic is straightforward, with no external data sources, network calls, or risky operations. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
