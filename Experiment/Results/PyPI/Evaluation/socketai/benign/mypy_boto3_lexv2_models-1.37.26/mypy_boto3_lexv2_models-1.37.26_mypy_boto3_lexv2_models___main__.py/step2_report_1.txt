  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It imports only the `sys` module.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` simply write static strings to stdout.\n   - The main function checks for the `--version` argument and responds accordingly.\n\n2. **Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n   - No evidence of data leaks, external communications, or code injection.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the script as a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n   - They agree on the absence of anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound and aligns with the code content.\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is non-malicious.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any external actions, so no hidden malicious intent.\n   - The static strings are harmless.\n   - The code is well-structured and clear.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate** after thorough review aligns with the reports: **no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
