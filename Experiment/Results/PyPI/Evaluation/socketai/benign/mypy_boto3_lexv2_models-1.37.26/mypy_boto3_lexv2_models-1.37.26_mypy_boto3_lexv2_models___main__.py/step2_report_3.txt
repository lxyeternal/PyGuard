  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It checks for \"--version\" in sys.argv; if present, it prints the version, else it prints package info.\n- Uses only standard sys module, no external dependencies or dynamic code execution.\n- No credentials, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and benign. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n### Step 2: Review report logic, reasoning, and summary\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, emphasizing the straightforward, static output, and lack of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, external data, or code that could be malicious are observed.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the scores\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0.0, justified given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified by the straightforward, static nature of the code.\n\n### Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores\n- No reason to assign higher scores; the code is non-malicious, static, and transparent.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risk\n\n---\n\n## Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
