  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes package info and version details to stdout.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply provides CLI commands for printing static package information and version. It reads input from sys.argv and writes static data to stdout. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely as a CLI utility for displaying package info and version. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
