  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output display",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no external data fetching or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise displays package details. It uses standard sys and prints static strings. No data is read from untrusted sources beyond command-line args, and no output involves external data or network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The script appears to serve a simple informational purpose without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It only outputs static package information based on user input.",
