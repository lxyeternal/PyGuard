  "purpose": "CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> print_info() or print_version() -> sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints package details. It imports only the sys module, performs no external data fetching, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The functions simply write static strings to stdout. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is transparent and benign. All reports correctly identify the script as a benign, static utility with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
