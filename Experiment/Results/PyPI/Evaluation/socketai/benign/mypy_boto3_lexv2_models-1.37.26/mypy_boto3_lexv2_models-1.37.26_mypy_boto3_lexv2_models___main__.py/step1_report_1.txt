{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Input source is sys.argv (command-line arguments).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' flows from sys.argv to the conditional check, leading to print_version output; otherwise, print_info is called, both writing to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that responds to '--version' argument by printing the package version, otherwise outputs package info. It uses standard sys modules for input detection and output. No external data sources, no network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no code execution beyond basic output. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for providing package information via CLI. No malware or security risks are present.",
