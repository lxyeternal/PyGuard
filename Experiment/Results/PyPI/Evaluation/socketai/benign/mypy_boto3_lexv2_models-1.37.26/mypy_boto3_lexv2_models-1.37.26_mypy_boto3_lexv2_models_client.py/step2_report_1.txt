  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. It recognizes the code as standard SDK interface code with extensive type annotations, documentation links, and no signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, considering the SDK nature)\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a well-structured SDK stub for type checking, with no malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment and scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a generated-style client class with standard patterns, no malicious constructs, or obfuscation. It emphasizes the type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical SDK stub, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, it describes the code as a type-safe, generated SDK client with standard patterns, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes the use of string literals for waiters and method signatures aligned with AWS SDK patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious logic detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for untrusted input via **kwargs, especially in methods like `generate_presigned_url` and other API call signatures. It notes that while untrusted data could be misused (e.g., in URL generation), no actual malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The concern about untrusted input is valid but does not indicate malicious intent; it's a typical SDK pattern where **kwargs** are used for flexibility. No evidence of malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk score is appropriately low, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward SDK stub with type annotations.\n- **Risk:** Very low, as the code is standard SDK scaffolding, primarily static and type-annotated.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable SDK code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, inherent to SDKs accepting untrusted input but no malicious intent)\n\n**Note:** The presence of extensive type annotations, documentation links, and the nature of the code as an SDK stub strongly indicates a benign supply chain component.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being legitimate, benign SDK interface code. No signs of sabotage, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The low risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
