  "purpose": "Type annotations and SDK interface definitions for the Lexv2 Models client, providing method signatures, documentation links, and type safety for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, class properties, and type annotations within the LexModelsV2Client class, especially in methods accepting **kwargs and overloads for waiters.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data inputs via **kwargs in methods like generate_presigned_url and API call signatures, which could be misused if improperly handled, but no actual data processing or execution occurs.",
  "flows": "External inputs (via **kwargs) into API methods, which are then used to construct requests; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs and method overloads are standard SDK patterns; no suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK stub for AWS LexV2, with extensive type annotations, documentation links, and method signatures. No executable logic, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The use of **kwargs and overloads is typical for SDKs, allowing flexible request parameters. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the static, interface-only nature of the code. No signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected. The code's purpose is to facilitate type-safe API calls, not to execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS LexV2 with no malicious, obfuscated, or sabotage elements. The low risk scores are justified, and the code poses no supply chain security threat. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
