  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the lexv2-models AWS service, providing method signatures, documentation links, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, method definitions with type annotations, and property definitions within the LexModelsV2Client class.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types that involve untrusted data or external inputs, especially in generate_presigned_url and methods accepting **kwargs.",
  "flows": "Potential untrusted inputs in method parameters (via **kwargs) could lead to misuse in URL generation or API calls, but no direct flow to external malicious endpoints is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code predominantly consists of method signatures, documentation, and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type annotation and class structure for a boto3 client, including method signatures, overloads for waiters, and exception type definitions. No runtime code execution, data handling, or external script invocation is present. The code appears purely declarative and aligns with standard SDK stub patterns. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured set of type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS lexv2-models service, with no malicious behavior detected. It serves as a static typing aid and does not contain executable or harmful code.",
