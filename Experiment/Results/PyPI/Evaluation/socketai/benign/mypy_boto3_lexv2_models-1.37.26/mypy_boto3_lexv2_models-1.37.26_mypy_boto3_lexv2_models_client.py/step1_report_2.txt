{
  "purpose": "Type annotations, client class definitions, and method interfaces for the boto3 LexModelsV2 service client, facilitating type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class and method definitions; property and overload decorators.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types; property definitions; overloads for waiters; method implementations that may accept untrusted input via kwargs.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing kwargs unpacked from input, which could include untrusted data; no explicit execution of code from input; no dynamic execution, eval, or system calls observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. The presence of detailed method signatures and extensive type hinting suggests standard SDK-like code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of class definitions, method signatures, and property annotations for a boto3 client. It includes type hints, overloads for waiters, and documentation links. No malicious payload, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code functions as a type-safe interface wrapper around the AWS SDK, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate SDK interface code intended for type checking and IDE support for the AWS LexV2 client. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The presence of extensive type annotations and documentation links indicates standard, benign SDK scaffolding.",
