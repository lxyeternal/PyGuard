  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 LexModelsV2 service, providing structured access to API methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class and method definitions within LexModelsV2Client.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types, particularly the use of **kwargs with type unpacking for API calls; property accessors.",
  "flows": "Method calls with **kwargs unpacked from specific request type definitions; use of 'generate_presigned_url' with Params and HttpMethod; get_waiter method overloads returning specific waiter classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Use of type unpacking is standard for API client stubs. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity. The presence of a copyright statement is benign. All functions are typical for a service client library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated-style client class for AWS Lex V2 models, including type annotations for input/output and method definitions aligned with the AWS SDK. The imports and class structure follow standard patterns for API clients, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The use of overloading for waiters is typical and well-structured. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated SDK stub with appropriate type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate AWS SDK client stub for LexV2 models, with no malicious or suspicious content detected. It is designed for structured API interaction and does not contain any harmful behaviors.",
