  "purpose": "To provide an interface module for the lexv2-models service, including client and waiter classes for AWS Lex V2.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .waiter), code comments, and docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines imports, constants, and documentation.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to defining and exporting classes and variables; no data from external sources is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and consists mainly of imports and documentation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from internal modules and re-exports them. The docstring includes usage instructions for clients. No external input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The structure is standard for a Python package interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an API interface layer for AWS Lex V2 models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package interface module with safe and benign content.",
