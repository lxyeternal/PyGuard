{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface and documentation for interacting with the AWS Lex V2 models service, including client creation and waiters.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .waiter), code documentation string, and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data; the code only sets up imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to defining the Client alias and __all__ exports, with no data processing or external input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The documentation contains a copyright date set in the future (2025), which may be a typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, a class alias assignment, a documentation string, and an export list. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities. The presence of future-dated copyright info is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward module setup for AWS SDK interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for AWS Lex V2 models, primarily involving imports, class aliasing, and export declarations. There are no suspicious activities, malicious code, or security risks detected.",
