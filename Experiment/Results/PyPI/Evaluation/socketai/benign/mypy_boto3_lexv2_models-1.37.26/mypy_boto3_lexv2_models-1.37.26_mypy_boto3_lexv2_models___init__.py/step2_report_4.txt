  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from internal modules (.client and .waiter), assigns an alias `Client` to `LexModelsV2Client`, and defines `__all__` for exports.\n   - The documentation string provides usage examples, which are benign and typical for SDK modules.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future and might be a typo, but it is not malicious or suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - The code is purely an interface layer with no external input, no network calls, no data processing, and no embedded secrets.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The security risk is also correctly 0.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions, as there are none present.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future date in the copyright, which is not a security concern.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align with the code content and analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The documentation and structure are standard. The only minor anomaly (future copyright year) is not security-related.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is safe, benign, and well-structured. The reports' evaluations are accurate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual content.",
