{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the lexv2-models service, importing client and waiter classes for use in AWS Lex V2 interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .waiter), documentation comment, and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python module defining classes and constants.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes from local modules and assigns the client class to a variable Client. It also defines the __all__ list for exports. The documentation string provides usage examples and links, with no indication of malicious intent. No user input handling, network operations, or credential management exists that could be exploited. The code structure is typical of an SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign interface module for AWS Lex V2 models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
