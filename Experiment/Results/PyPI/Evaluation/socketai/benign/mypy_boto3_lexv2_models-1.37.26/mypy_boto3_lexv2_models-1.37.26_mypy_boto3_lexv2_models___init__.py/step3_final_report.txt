{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for AWS Lex V2 models, importing client and waiter classes and exporting them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports internal classes and defines exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows are present; no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is static and import-based.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with static imports, class aliasing, and documentation. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or external data handling. The structure is typical for such modules, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The documentation example is benign, and the code does not perform any actions that could be malicious. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with the analysis.",
