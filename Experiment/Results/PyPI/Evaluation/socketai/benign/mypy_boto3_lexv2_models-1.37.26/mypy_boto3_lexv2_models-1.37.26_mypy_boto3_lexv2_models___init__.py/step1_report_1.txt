{
  "purpose": "To serve as the main interface and import module for the lexv2-models service, providing access to waiters and client classes for AWS Lex V2 models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .waiter), and inline documentation and comments.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data inputs, user data, or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports modules and defines exports without data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The license and documentation comments are standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class aliasing, and a __all__ declaration for exports. It includes a documentation string with example usage, which appears benign. The imports are from internal modules (.client and .waiter), and there are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network calls, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical SDK module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module setup for a Python SDK, importing classes and functions, and defining exports. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code.",
