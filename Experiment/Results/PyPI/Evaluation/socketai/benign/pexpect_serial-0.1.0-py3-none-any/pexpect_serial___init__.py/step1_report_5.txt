  "purpose": "The code imports the SerialSpawn class from a relative module and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.serial_spawn).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports a class and defines __all__, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module that exposes the SerialSpawn class from a local module. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external communication. The import and __all__ declaration are standard Python patterns for module exports. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. It merely exposes a class from a local module with no suspicious activity or security concerns.",
