  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ variable to specify publicly accessible components, specifically the SerialSpawn class from the serial_spawn module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing SerialSpawn from a relative module __main__ (serial_spawn).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and specifies __all__ for module exports. It does not process any input, perform network activity, or execute any dynamic code. The import is relative, which is standard in package development, and there are no indications of malicious intent. The code structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a standard module export definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
