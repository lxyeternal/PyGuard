{
  "purpose": "Library for handling internal TDS protocol communication, database operations, and related data structures for MSSQL connections.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, constants, and class initializations that do not handle external input directly; no obvious data source handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted external data, network communication functions are low-level socket wrappers, but no malicious activity such as data exfiltration or command execution is evident.",
  "flows": "No clear flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; most code is defining constants, data structures, or utility functions without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "The function `tds7_crypt_pass()` performs password mangling with custom bit-shifting, which is a common TDS protocol operation, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors are detected. No dynamic code execution, eval, or similar patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, data classes, and utility functions related to MSSQL TDS protocol. It includes functions for reading data streams and handling protocol messages. No external data sources or sinks appear to be exploited maliciously. Password mangling conforms to protocol standards. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The focus is on protocol implementation and error handling, which are typical for a database driver module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured MSSQL TDS protocol implementation with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not include backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. No supply chain sabotage signals are detected.",
