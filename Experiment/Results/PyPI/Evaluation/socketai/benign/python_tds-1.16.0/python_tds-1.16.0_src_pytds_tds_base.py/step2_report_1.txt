  "review": "Let's evaluate each report carefully, following the step-by-step instructions:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is mainly constants, data classes, utility functions, and error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Logic flaws or mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Risk: 0.1 — low, justified given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's assessment aligns with the code content. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is standard protocol definitions and utility functions. Password mangling is protocol-specific, not malicious.\n\n- **Logic flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — justified as low.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Consistent with the code; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The functions are typical for a database driver, with password obfuscation that follows known schemes.\n\n- **Logic flaws?**  \n  None detected.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  No signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code defines protocol constants, classes, and utility functions typical for MSSQL driver code.\n\n- **Logic flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code handles network I/O, errors, and data serialization in a standard way.\n\n- **Logic flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — justified, given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0).  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, justified by the code's purpose as a protocol utility library, which inherently involves network and data handling but no malicious intent.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, justified by the code's function but no real security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured MSSQL driver component with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The provided scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.",
