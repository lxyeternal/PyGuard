{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utilities, constants, type definitions, and exception classes for a Python module interfacing with MSSQL/TDS protocol",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (datetime, socket, struct, typing, pytds, OpenSSL), global constants, class definitions, functions for data handling and encoding, and configuration variables",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data handling occurs in functions like force_unicode, tds7_crypt_pass, and in exception creation; however, no direct sinks (such as network transmissions or file writes) are evident in this code segment",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., password in tds7_crypt_pass, message in _create_exception_by_message), through data transformation functions, to exception raising and return values; no external data is sent or received in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The cryptographic function uses simple XOR and bit shifts, which is standard for obfuscation, not malicious. The code structure is typical for a database driver. No suspicious network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines constants, data types, utility functions, and exception classes for handling MSSQL/TDS protocol interactions. The cryptographic function implements a basic obfuscation algorithm for passwords. No external or untrusted input is directly used in a way that would lead to security issues. No data leakage, command injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The overall design appears to be standard for a database driver supporting MSSQL, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured part of a database driver library with no malicious intent. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this segment. The functions and classes serve their intended purpose without suspicious behaviors.",
