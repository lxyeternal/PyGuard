  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard MSSQL/TDS protocol utility module, with no malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The password mangling is protocol-specific and not malicious. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential info leaks in exception messages if logs are not secured. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.1."
