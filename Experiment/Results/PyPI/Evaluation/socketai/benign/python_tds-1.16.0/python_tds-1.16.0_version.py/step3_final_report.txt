  "purpose": "Version management utility that retrieves the current version using 'git describe' or falls back to a stored release version, updating the version file if necessary.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'RELEASE-VERSION' file; executes 'git describe' command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; subprocess output is trusted; file writes are controlled.",
  "flows": "Subprocess output flows from 'git describe' to version string; fallback reads from file; version string may trigger file update.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masks errors; no input validation; reliance on environment's 'git' command.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version retrieval tasks, invoking 'git describe' and reading/writing a local version file. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. Exception handling is broad but typical for such scripts. The subprocess call depends on trusted commands, and file operations are straightforward. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified based on the benign, utility nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard version management utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
