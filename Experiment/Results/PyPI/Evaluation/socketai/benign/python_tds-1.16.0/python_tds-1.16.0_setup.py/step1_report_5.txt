{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure the 'python-tds' package including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, uses 'version.get_git_version()' for versioning.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external input/output that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from a file and sets package configuration based on static values and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; standard setup script structure. The 'version' module's 'get_git_version()' could be external but is typical for dynamic versioning.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from a file and defines package metadata for setup. No code execution based on untrusted input, no embedded malicious code, no network communication, or obfuscated logic. The use of 'version.get_git_version()' is a common pattern for dynamic versioning, assuming 'version' is a trusted local module. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security issues. It safely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
