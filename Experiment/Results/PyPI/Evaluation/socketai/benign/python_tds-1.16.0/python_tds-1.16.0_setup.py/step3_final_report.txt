{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'pytds', configuring metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', importing 'version' module, calling 'setuptools.find_packages(\"src\")', and setting package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or security-sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from file; external 'version.get_git_version()' provides version info; no data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' during setup, which is unconventional but benign; reliance on external 'version' module without inspection, but no malicious behavior inferred.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the external 'version' module, but no evidence suggests maliciousness. The 'print' statement is harmless. All signals point to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
