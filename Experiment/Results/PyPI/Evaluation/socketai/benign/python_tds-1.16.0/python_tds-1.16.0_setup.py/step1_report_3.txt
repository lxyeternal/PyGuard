{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'python-tds' for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file, importing 'version' module, and calling 'setuptools.find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements from file -> configuring package setup -> retrieving version info -> final package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or suspicious behavior. The use of 'version.get_git_version()' relies on external 'version' module, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It reads dependencies from a requirements.txt file, specifies package metadata, and sets up package discovery. The print statement for 'setuptools.find_packages(\"src\")' is merely informational and does not affect execution or pose security risks. The 'version' module's 'get_git_version()' function is external; without its code, no malicious intent can be inferred. Overall, the script appears to be a conventional setup script with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It reads dependencies securely, configures the package correctly, and contains no suspicious code or obfuscated elements.",
