{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'python-tds', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; importing modules for setup; calling 'setuptools.find_packages()' to list packages.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements from file -> setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' statement during setup, which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; dependencies loaded from a local file; no network activity or code execution paths observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup using setuptools, reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and configuring package metadata. The use of 'print' is benign and likely for debugging. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
