{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'python-tds', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, calling 'setuptools.find_packages', and importing a custom 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data is used in a way that could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements from file, retrieving version information, and passing package configuration to setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The 'version' module's function 'get_git_version()' is called, which could internally execute commands but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from an external file, utilizes setuptools to configure package metadata, and prints available packages in 'src'. The code appears standard for a Python package setup. No external inputs are used in a dangerous or untrusted manner. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are evident. The use of 'version.get_git_version()' relies on an external module, but no malicious behavior is suggested by this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads dependencies, configures package data, and displays package info.",
