  "purpose": "Utility functions for mapping collation IDs and LCIDs to character set names, and handling collation serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as sort_id and lcid used for charset determination; internal data structures for collation info.",
  "sinks": "Code lookup for codecs; internal data serialization; no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Mapping from sort_id or lcid to charset string, then to codecs; serialization/deserialization of collation data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward mappings and standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data mapping and serialization for SQL Server collations and character sets. It uses standard modules like codecs and struct, with mappings based on known collation IDs and LCIDs. No system commands, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are deterministic and rely on controlled input values. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for collation and charset management, with no malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the code poses no supply chain threat.",
