{
  "purpose": "Implements a TDS (Tabular Data Stream) session class to manage connection, request serialization, response parsing, transaction control, and protocol communication with SQL Server or compatible databases.",
  "sources": "Network input streams via '_reader', environment and login parameters, external modules for cryptography and protocol handling.",
  "sinks": "Network output via '_writer', environment variables, internal state modifications, error handling, and response processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network streams into internal parsing functions, and from internal request functions to network transmission; response tokens are parsed and handled accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no backdoors or malicious data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, protocol-compliant implementation of a TDS client session, handling login, environment changes, query execution, transaction management, and response parsing. It uses standard cryptographic and network modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The data flows are typical for a database driver, and external dependencies are used as intended. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and maintainable, indicating a legitimate supply chain component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a TDS client session, with no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It poses a minimal security risk consistent with typical database driver modules.",
