  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-referencing the code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a class `_TdsSocket` managing TDS protocol database connections.\n- Handles login, session management, MARS support, TLS fallback, and connection lifecycle.\n- Uses standard modules and practices; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity detected.\n- The code appears to be a typical, legitimate database connection handler.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, IPs, or domains.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration or backdoors.\n- The logic aligns with standard database connection management.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No apparent logical errors or security flaws in the provided snippet.\n- The code seems well-structured and standard for its purpose.\n- No issues with the scores assigned based on the provided code.\n\n### Review of individual report scores:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, justified by the benign nature)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (reasonable)\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (justified)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (reasonable)\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same as above; consistent and reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same assessment; no issues.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Same; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n### Consistency and scoring:\n- All reports consistently assess no malware, no obfuscation, and low security risk.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate for a standard database connection class, as it could be exploited if misused, but no direct vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2-0.3 could be justified, but 0.2 is reasonable.\n- **Overall:** No evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard low risk for connection management code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, legitimate database connection class with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend maintaining the current scores, as they align well with the code's nature.",
