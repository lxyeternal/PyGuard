{
  "purpose": "Provides backward compatibility for specific modules and dependencies related to SQL Server connection handling.",
  "sources": "Imports _token_map from tds_session module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code only consists of import statements with comments indicating usage; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing necessary components for backward compatibility. There are no functions, data processing, or external data inputs. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The comments clarify that _token_map is needed by a specific connector, indicating intentional, benign dependencies. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a simple compatibility purpose with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard import code with no malicious intent.",
