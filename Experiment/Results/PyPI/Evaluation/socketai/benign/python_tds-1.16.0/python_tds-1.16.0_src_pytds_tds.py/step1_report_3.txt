{
  "purpose": "This module provides backward compatibility for certain database connector components, specifically related to the tds_session and tds_base modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load _token_map from tds_session and tds_base module references.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or vulnerabilities are evident from the import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The comments clarify the purpose of imported variables but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and a variable. The comment indicates that _token_map is needed by sqlalchemy_pytds connector, which suggests this is for compatibility. No external input handling, data processing, or suspicious code structures are present. No potential attack vectors or malicious code are observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as a compatibility shim without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and typical for Python modules managing backward compatibility.",
