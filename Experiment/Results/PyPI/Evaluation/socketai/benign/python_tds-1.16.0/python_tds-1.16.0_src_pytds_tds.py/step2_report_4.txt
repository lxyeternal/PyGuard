  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal module that imports `_token_map` from `.tds_session` and `tds_base` from the current package, with comments indicating these are needed for the `sqlalchemy_pytds` connector. The code contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Backward compatibility.\n- Findings: No untrusted data flows, no anomalies, benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility for `_token_map` and `tds_base`.\n- Findings: No untrusted data sinks, no anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility for `tds_session` and `tds_base`.\n- Findings: No data leaks, no anomalies, benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is simple import statements with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility for `_token_map` and `tds_base`.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, no anomalies, benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility for `_token_map`.\n- Findings: No data flow, no anomalies, benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard import statements.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a compatibility shim.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Evaluation\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments\n- The code's simplicity and the comments indicate it is a standard, benign compatibility layer.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on the code and reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.",
