  "purpose": "Provides backward compatibility by importing _token_map from tds_session and tds_base module, ensuring support for sqlalchemy_pytds connector.",
  "sources": "Imports _token_map from .tds_session and tds_base from current package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static import statements only",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with comments indicating purpose",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with comments explaining their necessity for backward compatibility. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The imports are from internal modules, and the code serves a clear purpose without handling untrusted data or executing external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward compatibility layer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation.",
