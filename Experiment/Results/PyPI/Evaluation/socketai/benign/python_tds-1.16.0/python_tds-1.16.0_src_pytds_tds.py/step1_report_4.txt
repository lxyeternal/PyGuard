{
  "purpose": "Provides backward compatibility for the tds_session module, specifically related to the _token_map and tds_base components needed by sqlalchemy_pytds connector.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .tds_session (_token_map) and . (tds_base)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute code with untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports internal modules and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains import statements for internal components, explicitly mentioning their necessity for compatibility with the sqlalchemy_pytds connector. It includes no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. The comments clarify the purpose of imported items, and the structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not involve any suspicious activity or risky code patterns.",
