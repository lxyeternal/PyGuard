  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and assessing their validity and consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple set of import statements for internal modules and variables.\n- The comments clarify that these imports are needed for backward compatibility with the `sqlalchemy_pytds` connector.\n- No data handling, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves a specific compatibility purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code imports `_token_map` from `.tds_session` and `.tds_base`. There are no signs of errors or anomalies. The imports are syntactically correct and typical for Python modules.\n\n- **Malicious activity or vulnerabilities:**  \n  No evidence of malware, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The comments indicate usage for compatibility, not for executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly assume that the code's purpose is benign and that the imports are safe. No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n- **Overall risk scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely for compatibility with no malicious or risky behavior, the risk scores should remain low, ideally 0 or close to it.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No report suggests any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or potential vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  Since the code is minimal and safe, no further security concerns arise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward compatibility shim with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the reports are thorough and accurate, always ensure that such import modules are maintained and updated to prevent any future vulnerabilities, especially if the imported modules themselves change or become compromised.",
