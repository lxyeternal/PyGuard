  "purpose": "Provide backward compatibility for tds_session and tds_base modules.",
  "sources": "Importing _token_map from tds_session module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "Importing _token_map potentially used elsewhere, but no direct flow shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward module imports with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports _token_map from a local module tds_session and also imports tds_base. The comments indicate these are needed for the sqlalchemy_pytds connector, which suggests compatibility support. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. The module is simple and contains only import statements with comments explaining their purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module for backward compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
