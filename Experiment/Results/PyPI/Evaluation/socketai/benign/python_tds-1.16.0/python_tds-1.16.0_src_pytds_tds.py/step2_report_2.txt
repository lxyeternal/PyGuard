  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements, importing a variable `_token_map` from a local module `tds_session` and the entire `tds_base` module.\n- Comments indicate these imports are needed for backward compatibility with the `sqlalchemy_pytds` connector.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The reported issues (i.e., the code being a benign compatibility shim) are accurate.\n- The logic and reasoning in each report are sound; they correctly identify the code as straightforward and non-malicious.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential areas for improvement:**\n\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable. However, if the imported `_token_map` or `tds_base` modules contain malicious code (not visible here), that could change the assessment. But based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of such.\n- Since the code is very minimal, the likelihood of issues is extremely low. The confidence level of 1 across all reports is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, straightforward compatibility module with no security concerns. The scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
