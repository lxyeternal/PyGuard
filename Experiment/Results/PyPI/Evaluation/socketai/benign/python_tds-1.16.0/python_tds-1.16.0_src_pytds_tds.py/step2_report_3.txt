  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal module that imports `_token_map` from `.tds_session` and `.tds_base` from the current package.\n   - Comments indicate these imports are for backward compatibility with the `sqlalchemy_pytds` connector.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external inputs.\n   - The code is straightforward, with only static import statements.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, user input, or perform any network or file operations.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The imports are from internal modules, which are assumed to be part of the same package.\n   - The purpose appears to be providing compatibility, not executing malicious code.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscation is also 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n   - These scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Security Risk & Overall Risk Scores:**\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0 and a low overall risk score (mostly 0.0 to 0.1).\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, these scores are justified.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk scores based on the provided code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Logical Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, which matches the analysis.\n   - They do not identify any overlooked issues, such as the possibility of malicious modifications in the imported modules themselves. However, since the report focuses on this specific file, and the imports are from internal modules, this is acceptable.\n   - The reports correctly do not assume any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments seem accurate.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (appropriate; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (appropriate; no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a benign, straightforward module for backward compatibility.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No further action or increased risk scores are warranted.",
