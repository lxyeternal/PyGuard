{
  "purpose": "Provide backward compatibility for the tds_session module, specifically related to _token_map and tds_base dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .tds_session import _token_map; from . import tds_base",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; only static imports are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely imports modules and variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and only includes import statements with comments. No suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that provides backward compatibility by importing _token_map and tds_base from local modules. The comments indicate these are needed by the sqlalchemy_pytds connector. No data handling, user input, or network activity occurs. The code lacks any suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import operations without any suspicious activity.",
