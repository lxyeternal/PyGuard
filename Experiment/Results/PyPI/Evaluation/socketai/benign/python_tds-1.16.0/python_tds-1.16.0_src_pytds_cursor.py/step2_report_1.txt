  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes standard cursor functionality, including executing queries, stored procedures, bulk insert, and streaming large data. Data flows into session methods; no external network activity beyond database communication.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code aligns with typical database driver implementations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with a benign, standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malicious signals.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar, with emphasis on potential security concerns due to dynamic SQL in `copy_to`. The code constructs SQL commands via string formatting, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** The dynamic SQL in `copy_to` could lead to injection if parameters are malicious. However, no evidence of actual malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 — slightly higher due to potential injection risk but no actual malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard driver code; potential security concern in string construction but no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focus on bulk load via `copy_to`, with similar observations as report 2. The use of string formatting in SQL commands is noted but appears controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** Same as above; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard implementation with minor caution on SQL string construction.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar pattern, emphasizing execution and bulk load, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity outside database context.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical database driver code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes standard cursor operations, with no suspicious external activity.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, legitimate implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. **Consensus: 0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation detected. **Consensus: 0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The only concern is the use of dynamic SQL string formatting in `copy_to`. While this is a common pattern, it could pose injection risks if inputs are untrusted. However, the code appears to use proper quoting functions (`tds_base.tds_quote_id`) for identifiers, and the actual data parameters are passed separately, reducing risk. Given the overall benign nature, the risk is low but not zero.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (minor concern due to dynamic SQL string formatting, but no evidence of exploitation or malicious intent)\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of database cursor classes for SQL Server.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious sabotage.\n- The only minor concern relates to dynamic SQL construction in `copy_to`, which should be used carefully with trusted inputs.\n- Overall security risk remains low.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (to reflect the potential for injection if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious activity detected)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a typical database driver implementation with no malicious signals. The potential security concern in `copy_to` warrants cautious use but does not constitute malware or sabotage.",
