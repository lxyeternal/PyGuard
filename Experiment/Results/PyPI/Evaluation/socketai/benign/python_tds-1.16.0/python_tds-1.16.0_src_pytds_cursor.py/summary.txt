  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SQL Server database cursors with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The only minor concern involves dynamic SQL string formatting in copy_to, which should be used with trusted inputs to prevent injection. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code appears safe for use in production environments."
