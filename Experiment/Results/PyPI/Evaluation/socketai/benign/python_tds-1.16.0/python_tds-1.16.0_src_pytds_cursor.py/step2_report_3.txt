  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, well-structured implementation of database cursor classes for SQL Server, supporting MARS and non-MARS, with features like executing queries, stored procedures, bulk insert, streaming large data, and message handling.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration.\n- The code's dynamic SQL construction, especially in `copy_to`, is noted but deemed safe if parameters are sanitized or properly quoted.\n- The use of session methods and the overall pattern align with typical database driver practices.\n- The malware scores are all 0, with low security risks, and high confidence levels (~0.9), indicating the reviewers see no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of issues:** No signs of code that are not present or misrepresented.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical flaws or mistakes identified. The only minor concern is the dynamic SQL in `copy_to`, which is standard but should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores of 0 are reasonable; no evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** Low (0.2–0.3), appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no obfuscation (score 0).\n- **Potential assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes that dynamic SQL could be risky if inputs are untrusted but does not classify it as malware.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Dynamic SQL in `copy_to`:** Constructed via string formatting, but the code uses quoting functions (`tds_base.tds_quote_id`) for identifiers, which mitigates injection risks if used properly. The reports correctly flag this as a potential concern but not malicious.\n- **Streaming large data:** Handled via `set_stream`, standard practice.\n- **Session and connection management:** Properly handled, with deprecation warnings for connection property, which is acceptable.\n- **No network activity outside database communication:** Confirmed by all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 — low, mainly due to dynamic SQL construction, which is common in such utilities but warrants cautious use.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, slightly cautious about dynamic SQL but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate database driver implementation with no signs of malicious activity. The low scores and high confidence are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are thorough and align with my analysis. The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for database interaction layers. The only minor concern is the dynamic SQL in `copy_to`, which is standard practice but should be used with trusted inputs. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
