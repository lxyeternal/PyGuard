  "purpose": "This code implements a Python module for establishing and managing connections to MS SQL servers, including TLS setup, load balancing, failover, and socket configuration.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as dsn, server, failover_partner, user, password, environment variables, and socket options.",
  "sinks": "Socket creation and configuration, login procedures, TLS context setup, and connection objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into socket connection setup, TLS configuration, login, and connection object creation; errors and retries are handled during socket and login phases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code manages database connection setup with proper handling of TLS, authentication, retries, and load balancing. It uses standard socket options, avoids hardcoded secrets, and implements error handling and exponential backoff correctly. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a database connection module for MS SQL, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles sensitive data appropriately and follows standard security practices. The overall security risk is low, and the code is free from obfuscation or malware.",
