{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS ECS-related enumerations and constants to ensure type safety and consistency in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. The literals themselves are defined directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "None present. The code only declares type aliases using 'Literal'. No data processing or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks. The code is purely declarative, establishing type annotations without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual behavior, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a documentation string and license info, followed by a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. The bulk of the code defines numerous 'Literal' types for various AWS ECS configuration options. These are simple string unions, used for static type checking. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external data access occurs. The structure and format are typical for a module dedicated to type annotations. There are no indications of malicious intent, code injection, or malicious behavior. All constants are descriptive and follow AWS conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious type annotation module for AWS ECS literals. It contains no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. It simply provides type definitions to improve code safety and readability.",
