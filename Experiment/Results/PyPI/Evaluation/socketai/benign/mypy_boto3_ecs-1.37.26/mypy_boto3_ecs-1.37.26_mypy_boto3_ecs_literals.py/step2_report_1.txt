  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, source, data flow, anomalies, and overall logic.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for ECS and AWS resources; purely static, based on hardcoded string literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow; static definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed; code is purely type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies this as benign, static code meant for type safety, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defines string literals for AWS ECS and other services; uses conditional import for Python compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external input; static constants only.\n- **Anomalies:** None; code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correctly identifies this as a benign, purely declarative module for type annotations.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type aliases for AWS resource identifiers; no dynamic code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None; static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign, serving as static type annotations.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS ECS enumerations; uses conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** None; purely static.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard type annotation module.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defines string literals for AWS ECS types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, static, type annotation definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, backdoors, obfuscated code, or secrets are present.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety and autocompletion for AWS SDKs, which is benign.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external data handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.5 or lower. The code is straightforward and transparent; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0, as the code is static type definitions with no security implications.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on all reports and the detailed analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured static type annotation module for AWS ECS and related services, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
