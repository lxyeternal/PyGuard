{
  "purpose": "Defines various string literal types for AWS ECS service literals using Python type annotations for improved code correctness and auto-completion.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing modules, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and defines string Literal types.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is purely static type definitions with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and consistent with standard type annotation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes string literal types for use in type annotations, facilitating type safety and documentation. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard. No user input handling, network communication, or data processing is present. The code does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated components. It strictly serves as a static type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for defining string literal types for AWS ECS and related services. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected. The code is well-structured and does not pose any supply chain or runtime security risks.",
