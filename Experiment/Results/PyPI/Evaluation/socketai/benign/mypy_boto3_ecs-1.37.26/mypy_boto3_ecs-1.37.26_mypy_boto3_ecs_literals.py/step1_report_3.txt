{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various ECS and AWS resource identifiers using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and defines multiple Literal types with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; the code mainly defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static type annotations are used for code clarity and type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; the code is purely declarative for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version. It then declares many string literal types representing ECS and AWS resource identifiers. All definitions are static, hardcoded strings serving as type aliases. No code reads input or writes output, nor does it perform any runtime logic or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code’s purpose is to provide type safety and clarity for AWS resource identifiers in type-annotated Python code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of type alias declarations for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for improving code correctness.",
