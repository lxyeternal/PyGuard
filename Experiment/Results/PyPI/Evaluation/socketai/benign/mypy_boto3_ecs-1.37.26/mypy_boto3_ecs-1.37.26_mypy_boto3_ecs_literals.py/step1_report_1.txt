  "purpose": "Define type literals for ECS service configuration and related AWS resources to support type checking in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. Definitions of type aliases with string literals.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into critical operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is solely type annotations and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type aliases for various ECS and AWS resource string literals, using conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It contains no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no data processing logic. The purpose is to facilitate type safety and autocompletion. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. It appears to be an intentionally designed, benign set of type definitions supporting AWS SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS ECS and other AWS services, with no malicious or security risk indicators. It merely aids in type checking and code clarity.",
