  "purpose": "Defines static type aliases for AWS ECS and related resource literals using Python's Literal type, supporting multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to type aliases, with conditional import for 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or untrusted data flow; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "None; static type alias declarations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward static type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS ECS and other AWS services, with no dynamic code, external input handling, or network operations. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs. Its purpose is to improve type safety and IDE autocompletion, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS ECS resource identifiers. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its static, harmless nature. The overall security risk score is 0, malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0.",
