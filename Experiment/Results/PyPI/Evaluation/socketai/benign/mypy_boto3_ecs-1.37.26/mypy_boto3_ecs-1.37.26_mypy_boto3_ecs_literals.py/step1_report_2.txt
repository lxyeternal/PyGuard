{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations using Python's Literal for various AWS ECS and related service string constants, facilitating type safety and code clarity for AWS SDK usage.",
  "sources": "The source data is primarily hardcoded string literals representing AWS ECS and other AWS service constants, imported via conditional type import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process or output untrusted external data; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only establishes type annotations for known AWS string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code solely consists of static literal definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with documentation and copyright notices, then conditionally imports the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then declares a large number of string literal type aliases representing AWS ECS and other AWS service constants. The pattern is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no external input handling, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The content appears to be a standard, well-structured module for type safety, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining static string constants as type aliases for AWS ECS and related services, with no malicious intent, no external data processing, and no suspicious behavior. It serves as a utility for type-safe code in AWS SDK contexts.",
