  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overlooked risks.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is static type annotations for AWS ECS and related resources, with no dynamic or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is benign, purely static type alias definitions, with no data flow or security concerns.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both zero, which is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is just static string literal definitions for AWS constants, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Zero, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is static, with no runtime logic or external data processing, purely for type safety.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Zero, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on the straightforward declaration of string literal types for AWS ECS and services, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity or security risks detected.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Zero, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a description of static string literal type definitions for AWS ECS, with no dynamic or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no anomalies or security issues.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Zero, fitting the context.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`.  \n- **Potential Risks:** There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code, external data access, secrets, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** None detected, as the code serves solely as type annotations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern across all reports and the code's nature, I concur that the code is benign. It is a well-structured, static set of type definitions for AWS ECS and related services, with no malicious or security risk indicators.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of type annotations for AWS resource string literals, with no malicious or security concerns.",
