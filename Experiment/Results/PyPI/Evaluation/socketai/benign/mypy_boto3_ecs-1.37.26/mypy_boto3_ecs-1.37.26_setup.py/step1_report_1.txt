{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-ecs package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and gathers package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code. No dynamic code execution or data manipulation is present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; all data sources are static or read from files for configuration purposes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with typical package configuration, no unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a markdown file for description, and uses setuptools to define package configuration. All code appears to be boilerplate for Python package setup. No dynamic or insecure code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is legitimate, contains no malicious code, and poses no security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
