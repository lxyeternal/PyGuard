  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package called 'mypy-boto3-ecs' using setuptools, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all inputs are static or file reads for setup purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static inputs are used throughout the script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The script performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pathlib for file handling and setuptools for package setup, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All inputs are static or from local files. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or untrusted data handling. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to typical setup procedures without any suspicious elements.",
