{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'mypy-boto3-ecs' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and uses static package metadata for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data processing; setup parameters are hardcoded or based on local files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from pathlib and 'setup' from setuptools. It reads the README.md file to set long_description. The setup() function is called with static metadata including name, version, author, email, description, classifiers, keywords, URLs, dependencies, and package data. All values are hardcoded or derived from local files. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are processed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no indication of malware or security risks.",
