  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-ecs library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, static metadata fields, dependencies, package data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, no external commands, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data used solely for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports 'Path' and 'setuptools.setup', reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. There are no dynamic operations, no user input handling, no network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All signals indicate a benign package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
