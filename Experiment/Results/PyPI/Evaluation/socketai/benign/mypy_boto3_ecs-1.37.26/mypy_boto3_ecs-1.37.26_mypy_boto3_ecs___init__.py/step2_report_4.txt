  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes, defines an alias, and exposes an API for ECS.\n- No data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is clean, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- The only questionable aspect is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but could be flagged as a documentation or data inconsistency.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough reasoning.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code is purely boilerplate, with no external data, user input, or sensitive operations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It could be flagged as a documentation inconsistency, but not a security risk.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard interface module with no security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, well-structured Python module for ECS API exposure, with no malicious or risky elements. The scoring reflects this appropriately.",
