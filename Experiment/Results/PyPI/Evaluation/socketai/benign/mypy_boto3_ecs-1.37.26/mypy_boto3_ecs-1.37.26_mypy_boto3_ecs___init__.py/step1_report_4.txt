{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to interact with AWS ECS services, including client creation, paginators, and waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), and the inline documentation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Imports and module exports flow logically without untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behavior detected. Documentation is extensive but does not contain embedded code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and functions related to ECS management. The inline docstring includes sample usage, which appears benign. No code execution, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. All imports are from internal modules and do not suggest malicious external dependencies. The code structure is clean and adheres to typical Python module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, non-malicious interface wrapper for AWS ECS operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It is safe for use.",
