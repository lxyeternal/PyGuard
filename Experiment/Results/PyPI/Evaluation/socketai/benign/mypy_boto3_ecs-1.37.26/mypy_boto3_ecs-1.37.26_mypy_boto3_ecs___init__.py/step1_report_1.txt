  "purpose": "This code defines the main interface for the ECS service in a Python package, including imports, class definitions, and documentation.",
  "sources": "It sources classes and functions from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and loads them into the package namespace.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not perform any data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; it only establishes class and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is mainly boilerplate and import statements with inline documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and defining the public API via __all__. It includes docstring documentation with usage examples. No runtime data handling, user input processing, or external data interaction is visible. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears to be a clean module setup for an ECS client interface.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface module for ECS, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured setup file with documentation. No malicious intent or harmful operations are detected.",
