  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS ECS service client, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method implementations, primarily reading from boto3 and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods return 'PageIterator' objects; no untrusted data flows directly into critical sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' methods accept parameters with type unpacking, returning paginated responses. No data flows into untrusted sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard boto3 paginator patterns, no obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type definitions and class wrappers for boto3 ECS paginators with type annotations. The imports and class structures follow typical patterns for type safety, with conditional typing based on Python version. The 'paginate' methods are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoor code. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a type-hinting package for boto3 ECS paginator objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of type-annotated paginator classes for AWS ECS, designed to improve type safety in Python. No malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. The code is safe and appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious utility module.",
