{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for ECS service client pagination in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from sys, imports type definitions from type_defs, and utilizes parameters in the paginate methods (via **kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs of various request types; these could potentially be used maliciously if manipulated, but they are standard in boto3 paginator usage. No untrusted data is explicitly used to influence system behavior beyond typical boto3 patterns.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from **kwargs in paginate methods, which are passed to the underlying Paginator. The response data flows from the Paginator to callers. No external untrusted data source manipulation or network connections are explicitly evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard boilerplate for boto3 paginator classes with type annotations. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and appears auto-generated or boilerplate in nature.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for boto3 ECS paginators, adhering to standard patterns with type checking for Python >=3.12. It imports necessary types, sets up base classes conditionally based on typing checks, and provides method signatures for paginate. No malicious logic, network activity, or secret handling is detected. The code functions purely as type annotations and class wrappers, with no behavior that could harm or exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, boilerplate paginator class definitions with comprehensive type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
