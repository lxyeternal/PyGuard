  "purpose": "Type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 ECS paginators to enable static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from boto3 and type_defs modules, class inheritance, and the paginate method accepting **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods pass **kwargs to boto3's paginator; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in **kwargs flow into boto3's paginator; no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, type-safe wrapper around boto3 ECS paginator classes, providing type annotations for responses and request parameters. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, inherits from boto3's Paginator, and defines paginate methods that delegate to boto3's implementation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of **kwargs is typical for boto3 API calls and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for type annotations of boto3 ECS paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
