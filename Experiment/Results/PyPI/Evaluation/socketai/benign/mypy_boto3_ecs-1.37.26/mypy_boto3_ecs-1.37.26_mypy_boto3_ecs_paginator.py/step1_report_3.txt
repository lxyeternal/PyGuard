{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for ECS service client paginators, enabling better static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters accepting **kwargs with specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted **kwargs which are passed directly to the underlying boto3 paginator. No other data sinks or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Source (kwargs in paginate methods) -> Passed to Paginator.paginate -> returns PageIterator with response data types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard type-annotated class definitions for boto3 paginators with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for ECS, extending generic Paginator with specific response types. Conditional imports and type checking constructs are standard for Python 3.12+ compatibility. The 'paginate' methods are overrides that accept flexible kwargs typed with predefined type defs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic is present. The code is a typical type annotation and class wrapper around boto3's pagination, with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes for ECS, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly facilitates static type checking for boto3 ECS paginators.",
