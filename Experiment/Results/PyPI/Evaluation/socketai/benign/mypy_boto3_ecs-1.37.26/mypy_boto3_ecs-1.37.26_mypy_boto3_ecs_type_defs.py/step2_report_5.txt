  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data schemas without executing logic or handling data dynamically.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None. The report correctly identifies the code as a static, schema-focused module with no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious code detected.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n  - Risk: 0.95 — justified, as the code could be used maliciously if misused, but as-is, it's benign.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code remains a static set of type definitions with no runtime logic or external input handling.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report notes the absence of secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, acknowledging potential misuse but no inherent risk.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is purely type annotations and data schemas.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The report emphasizes the benign, structural nature.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code defines static data types and no runtime logic.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The detailed analysis confirms no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - Malware: 0 — suitable.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a set of static type annotations.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The analysis correctly states that no runtime or malicious behavior exists.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \nPerfectly aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.95), but all are justified given the nature of the code (type schemas). The higher scores reflect potential misuse if the code were embedded maliciously, but as-is, the code remains benign.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, considering potential misuse but no inherent danger)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS ECS SDKs, with no malicious or suspicious content. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
