{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and structured data definitions for AWS ECS service and task configurations using TypedDicts and type unions.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, import statements, and external literal imports; no external input sources or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present; the code strictly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, external input handling, or processing logic; only static type definitions and data schema structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, focused on type annotations for API request/response schemas; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and extension modules for type annotations and defines a comprehensive set of TypedDicts, Unions, and constants to model AWS ECS API data structures. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is typical for compatibility. No dynamic execution, input reading, network calls, or embedded commands are present. The code does not execute any logic beyond defining data schemas. The presence of docstrings and type annotations suggests it's for SDK or API schema generation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for ECS service definitions. It is purely declarative, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The design aligns with SDK or API typing modules and contains no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
