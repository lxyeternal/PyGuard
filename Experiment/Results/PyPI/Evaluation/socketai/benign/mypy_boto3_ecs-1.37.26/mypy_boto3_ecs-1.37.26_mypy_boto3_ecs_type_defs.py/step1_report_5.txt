{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS ECS service configurations, used for type safety and code clarity in Python projects interacting with ECS.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, constants from imported literals, and external dependencies like sys, datetime, and typing modules. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code defines data structures and type annotations; it does not include runtime data handling, input/output operations, or network interactions that could be sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is purely static, establishing data schemas without dynamic data processing, so no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code strictly defines types and data structures, adhering to standard patterns for type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining TypedDict structures, type aliases, and constants for AWS ECS service configuration. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No code executes any runtime logic or handles untrusted input; it solely provides type annotations and data schema definitions. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be a well-structured type definition module, typical for SDKs or API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, standard type annotation and data schema definition module intended for safe use in Python projects. It does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could be malicious. The overall security risk is negligible.",
