{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS ECS service and task configurations, facilitating type safety and clarity in SDK usage.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code primarily defines types, classes, and data structures for use within applications.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data or perform actions based on external inputs; the code solely provides type definitions and class structures.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to static type annotations and structured data definitions; no runtime data flows or processing logic involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains comprehensive type definitions with no apparent hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code appears to be standard for SDK type hinting and structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines data types, classes, and unions for AWS ECS SDK usage, employing type annotations, TypedDicts, and Union types. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code's purpose is solely to enforce data structure consistency. No external data sources, no runtime logic, and no side effects are present. The initial imports are standard and do not execute any code. Overall, the code appears benign and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS ECS SDK in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is consistent with standard SDK type annotation practices, serving as scaffolding for safe application development.",
