{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and data structures for managing ECS service configurations, task definitions, containers, and related resources in Python, primarily for use with boto3 ECS SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type definitions, imported literals, and possibly external configuration parameters passed during runtime; no direct data input sources like network or file I/O are present within these type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks could include AWS API calls that send configuration data; no direct data sinks or untrusted output points are evident within this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, as the code mainly consists of type annotations and TypedDict definitions. Data flow would occur during actual execution when data is passed into functions or API calls that utilize these types.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely structural, with no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. The presence of detailed type definitions and import statements is standard. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines type annotations for ECS resource management, including resource configurations, requests, responses, and complex resource unions. It employs standard Python typing practices with conditional imports based on Python version. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, file I/O, or executable logic that could be malicious. The inclusion of imports from future and typing extensions, as well as comprehensive type definitions, is consistent with safe, well-structured SDK-like code. No indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or privacy violations are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for ECS resource configuration and management, implemented safely and with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It serves as a static type structure for use with ECS SDKs or similar tooling. Overall, it presents no security risks or malicious behavior signals.",
