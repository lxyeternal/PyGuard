  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Purely type annotations and data schemas for ECS, no external input or data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flows, no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Static definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, SDK-like schema definitions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95 (high, but justified due to potential misuse in broader context).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The high risk score reflects the importance of these definitions in security-sensitive contexts but is justified given the potential for misuse if integrated maliciously elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for ECS, no direct data input, primarily static definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active data sinks; data flows during runtime but not within this code.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, well-structured type definitions, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely structural, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, but noted).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The very low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for ECS, no external data sources or runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks or flows; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK type annotations, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, standard for SDKs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, no runtime data input or processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active data sinks; static definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard type definitions, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, purely structural.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type annotations, no runtime or external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, well-structured type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, non-malicious, typical for SDKs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently report 0, which is correct. No malicious code, no embedded commands, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct; the code is transparent and declarative.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0 to 0.1), justified by the nature of the code being static type definitions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas for AWS ECS SDK usage.\n- No runtime logic, no data processing, no external input handling within this snippet.\n- No embedded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- The high security risk score in Report 1 is justified if these schemas are misused in a malicious context, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect potential misuse if integrated maliciously, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the nature of the code. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
