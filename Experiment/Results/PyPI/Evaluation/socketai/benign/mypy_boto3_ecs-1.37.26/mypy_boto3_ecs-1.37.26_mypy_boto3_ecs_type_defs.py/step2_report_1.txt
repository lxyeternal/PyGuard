  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and any signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Purely type annotations and data schemas for AWS ECS, no external input or code execution.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is declarative, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The use of conditional imports and comprehensive type definitions aligns with SDK or API schema generation.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is negligible. The high confidence (0.95) is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on ECS data schemas.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The mention of potential data sinks (like API calls) is theoretical; the code itself is purely structural.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware remains 0, obfuscated 0, and risk very low. The confidence (0.95) is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with emphasis on the lack of external data sources or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis:** Clear that this is a straightforward type definition module with no runtime logic or external dependencies that could be malicious.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated 0, risk minimal. The confidence (1) is well-founded.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, static type annotations for ECS SDK usage.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious code, runtime logic, or suspicious patterns. The code is a standard SDK type module.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk negligible. The confidence (1) is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on safe, static type definitions.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external input handling. The code is purely declarative.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk minimal. The confidence (1) is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** Only static type annotations and data schemas for AWS ECS SDK.  \n- **Logical flaws or anomalies:** None. No obfuscation, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). These are reasonable given the nature of the code.  \n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting the purely declarative, safe nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation techniques are present.  \n- **Risk score:** Should remain very low, around 0 or 0.1, since there's no malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign, purely structural, and SDK-like. No changes to scores are necessary. The code is a well-structured, safe set of type annotations with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal, theoretical concerns about data origin, but overall very safe)\n\nThis careful review confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its intended purpose.",
