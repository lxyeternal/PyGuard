{
  "purpose": "The code provides detailed type annotations and data schemas for AWS ECS service definitions, primarily serving as SDK or API schema representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through type annotations and data structure definitions; no external data sources or runtime input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code is purely declarative and static.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows exist within this code; it only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, Unions, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility, with no executable logic or dynamic code. It is a schema-like module intended for type checking and SDK modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with its static, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS ECS SDK usage, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate, and the confidence in this assessment is very high.",
