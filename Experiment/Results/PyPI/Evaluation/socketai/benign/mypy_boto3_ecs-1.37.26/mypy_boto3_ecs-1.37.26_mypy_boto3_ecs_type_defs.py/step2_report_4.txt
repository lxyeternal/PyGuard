  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, cross-referencing the code and the provided evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data schemas for AWS ECS SDK usage. No executable logic, secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 (high confidence that it's safe).\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is purely type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static, with no external data input or malicious behaviors. Slight mention of \"security risk\" at 0.1, perhaps due to the nature of data modeling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is reasonable, given the code's purely structural purpose. The mention of potential data sinks is theoretical; no actual data flow or execution occurs.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a straightforward set of type definitions with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, emphasizes that the code is static, with no runtime or external input handling, and no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlighting the code's role as a type annotation module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a set of static type definitions; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assessed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas with TypedDicts, Unions, and constants for AWS ECS API interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores, mostly near zero, are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed as 0; no malicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, structural nature, a risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05 (very low, reflecting that this is a purely structural SDK module)\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire set of reports correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The high confidence scores are justified, and the low risk assessment is appropriate.",
