  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data schemas for AWS ECS SDK usage. No logic, data processing, or malicious code is present.\n- **Security & Malware:** The report assigns malware score 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, which is high given the purely declarative nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The report's assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code as static type definitions for ECS configurations, with no dynamic or malicious logic.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1) than report 1, but still very low, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in such type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the assessment is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The report aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, correctly states that the code is only type annotations and data structures, with no runtime logic or malicious intent.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1, indicating certainty.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious elements.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms that the code is only static type definitions, with no external data sources or malicious behaviors.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, aligned.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates that the code is solely type annotations and data schemas, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, fitting.\n- **Confidence:** 1, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code Content:** Purely declarative, defining types, unions, and constants for AWS ECS SDK modeling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected; no executable code, no secrets, no dynamic logic.\n- **Security Risk:** Virtually zero, as the code is just type annotations.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature, should remain very low, around 0.0–0.1.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No suspicious or malicious elements are present. The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (or even 0.0 if strict minimal risk is preferred). The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for SDK purposes, with no security concerns.",
