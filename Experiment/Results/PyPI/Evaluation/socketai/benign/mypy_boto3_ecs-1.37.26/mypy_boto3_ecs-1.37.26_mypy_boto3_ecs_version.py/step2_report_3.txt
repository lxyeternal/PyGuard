  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.26\"\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data processing.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The comments are benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code is static, contains no dynamic or external inputs, and is a common pattern, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n   - The code is purely metadata, serving as a version identifier.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward and readable)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Additional Remarks:**\n- The version string \"1.37.26\" appears normal and does not raise any suspicion.\n- The copyright year \"2025\" is in the future relative to the current date, which might be unusual, but this does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's nature.",
