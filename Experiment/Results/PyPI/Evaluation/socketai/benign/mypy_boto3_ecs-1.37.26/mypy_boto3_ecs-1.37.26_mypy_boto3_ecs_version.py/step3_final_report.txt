  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data reads.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string with a comment. It contains no dynamic behavior, inputs, outputs, or external data handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty in the benign nature. The copyright year being in the future (2025) is unusual but does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
