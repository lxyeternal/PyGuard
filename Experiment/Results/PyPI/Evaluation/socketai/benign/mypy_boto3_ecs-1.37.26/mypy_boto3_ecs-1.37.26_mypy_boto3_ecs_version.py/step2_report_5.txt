  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.26\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or external data reads.\n- The code is minimal and straightforward, typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard version declaration.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n**No significant flaws or mistakes in the reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n- The high confidence is justified.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, and the code is benign, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n- If any score were higher, it would require evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities, which are absent here.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is a simple variable assignment.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n- No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations & Personal Estimate**\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the existing assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
