  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns a value to a variable, with no flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright comment, followed by a single variable assignment for __version__. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The version string is hardcoded, which is common practice and not inherently suspicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose any security risks.",
