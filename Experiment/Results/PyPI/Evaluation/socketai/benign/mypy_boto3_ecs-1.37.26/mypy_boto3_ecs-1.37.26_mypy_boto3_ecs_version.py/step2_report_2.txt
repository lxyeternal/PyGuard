  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is minimal, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Confirmations and validations:**\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies are consistently described across reports.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- No issues are detected in the code itself.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No report claims or implies any suspicious or malicious intent beyond version declaration.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The analysis correctly identifies that this code is benign and poses no security risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain incident report correctly identifies the code as harmless, with no security or malware concerns.",
