  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to parse arguments and `sys.stdout.write()` to output data.\n   - No external data fetching, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is straightforward, readable, and standard for such utilities.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code performs only benign, informational output.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No external dependencies or network interactions.\n   - The only potential concern could be if it were used maliciously to impersonate or mislead, but given its static nature, this is unlikely.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports concur that the code is a simple CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malware.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n   - The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n   - The **security risk** score of 0 is justified, as there are no security concerns.\n   - The **risk score** in each report is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential for Re-evaluation:**\n   - Since the code is straightforward and static, there's no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n   - **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0                     |\n| Overall Risk    | 0                     |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
