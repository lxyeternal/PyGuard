  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for argument parsing",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting information",
  "flows": "Argument check in main() leads to either print_version() or print_info() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that outputs predefined package info or version based on command-line arguments. It uses standard modules with no external dependencies, no dynamic data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign intent, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code's behavior is predictable and safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
