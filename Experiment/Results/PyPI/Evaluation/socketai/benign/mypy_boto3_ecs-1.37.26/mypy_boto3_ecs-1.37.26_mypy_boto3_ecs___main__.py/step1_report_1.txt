  "purpose": "CLI tool for printing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information.",
  "flows": "User input (--version argument) triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that provides package info and version details. It uses standard Python functions and sys module calls to handle input and output. No user input data is processed beyond checking for a command-line argument. No external data fetching, network activity, or file operations are present. The script does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is that it displays static package info, but this is typical for CLI tools and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely outputs predefined package information and version details based on user input.",
