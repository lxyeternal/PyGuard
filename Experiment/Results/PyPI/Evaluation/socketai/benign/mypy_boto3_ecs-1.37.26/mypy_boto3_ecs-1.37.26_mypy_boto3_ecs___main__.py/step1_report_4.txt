  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and solely outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print package info and version to stdout. It checks for '--version' argument and accordingly prints version info; otherwise, it prints package details. No data from untrusted sources is processed, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended for informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no hidden functionality.",
