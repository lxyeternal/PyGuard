{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line interface entrypoint that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, it calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, it calls print_info() which outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI handler that checks for '--version' argument and responds accordingly. It only outputs static, predefined strings. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The structure and code are typical of a CLI utility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that provides package information and version details. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
