  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses standard Python modules (`sys`) with no external dependencies.\n- No user input processing beyond argument checking.\n- No network activity, file operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for informational purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None. The code only outputs static information.\n- **Malware or backdoors:** Not present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- The scoring for malware (`0`) aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The overall security risk score (`0`) is appropriate.\n\n### Score Justification\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n### Critical Observations\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions, so raising the malware or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n- The purpose of the code is purely informational, which is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **Malware score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at **0**.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scoring. The code is a simple CLI utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior, and no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
