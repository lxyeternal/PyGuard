{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, and outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "sinks": "Outputs data directly to stdout via sys.stdout.write(). No other sinks such as network, files, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is: if '--version' is in sys.argv, print version info; otherwise, print package info. Data flows from internal functions to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() which handles command-line arguments. It only outputs static information to stdout. There are no input streams, no data processing, and no external communication or side effects beyond printing information. The code structure is simple and standard for CLI tools. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
