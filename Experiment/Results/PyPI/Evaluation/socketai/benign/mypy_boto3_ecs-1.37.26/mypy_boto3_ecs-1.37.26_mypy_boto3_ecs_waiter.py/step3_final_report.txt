  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for ECS waiters, serving as a structural and documentation aid for boto3 ECS client waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines classes and methods with no data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data handling; method parameters are for typing only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class extensions with documentation links, no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for ECS waiter classes, extending botocore.waiter.Waiter, with methods accepting **kwargs for waiter configuration. It uses conditional imports for Unpack based on Python version. The structure is standard, with no runtime data handling, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The use of **kwargs is typical for SDK wrappers and does not introduce security risks. The code's purpose is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of class definitions for ECS waiters, intended for type safety and documentation support. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present.",
