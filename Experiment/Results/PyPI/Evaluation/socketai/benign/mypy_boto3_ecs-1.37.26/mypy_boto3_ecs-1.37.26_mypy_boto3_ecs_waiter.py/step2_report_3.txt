  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of the findings, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, type-annotated set of ECS waiter classes, with no runtime data handling or external data processing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0, confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as benign, purely for type annotations and class definitions. The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on the use of **kwargs and type annotations. It notes that **kwargs could influence AWS resources via boto3 but emphasizes no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies; standard use of **kwargs and type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slight securityRisk score (0.1) seems to reflect that **kwargs could influence AWS resources, but since this is a wrapper around boto3 waiters, this is expected and not malicious. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The reasoning is sound. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward class definitions, no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is purely structural, no malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis; no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No external data sources, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; purely type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0.0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in report 2 (0.1), justified by the fact that **kwargs could influence AWS resources, but this is standard and expected for such wrappers.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, I would assign a risk score of **0.0** to **0.1** at most, since it’s a standard type annotation wrapper with no external data handling or security implications.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The minor security risk score in report 2 is justified but could be considered negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nI concur with the existing assessments. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as a type annotation aid for ECS waiters.",
