{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for ECS service status using boto3-stubs for type annotations and improved IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class method parameters with **kwargs for waiter options.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling; no network, file, or system modification functions present.",
  "flows": "Class methods pass **kwargs to superclass wait methods; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is straightforward type annotation and class extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait method that accepts flexible **kwargs typed via Unpack with specific type defs. No data is read from external sources or written to sinks; no dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for typing support and documentation purposes, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured module providing type annotations and wrapper classes for ECS waiters. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements; it is primarily for type safety and documentation support.",
