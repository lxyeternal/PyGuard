  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type annotations and class definitions for ECS waiters, with no runtime data handling or external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — justified, as the code is benign and serves as a type safety layer.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate; the code is straightforward, with no security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on type annotations and class structures, using **kwargs for passing options.\n- **Potential Concern:** The use of **kwargs in wait methods could, in theory, be exploited if misused, but since these are just method signatures with no runtime data processing, the risk remains minimal.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly elevated due to the use of **kwargs, but in context, it's standard and safe.\n- **Justification:** The code doesn't process untrusted data; it merely forwards kwargs to the parent class. The minimal risk score seems acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard class definitions, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware and obfuscation, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward type annotation layer, with no data processing.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- **Notes:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with one report (Report 2) assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the use of **kwargs, but still minimal.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for ECS waiters, with no security issues or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the code's nature. The only slight point is the 0.1 risk in Report 2, which is reasonable but could be adjusted to 0.0 for strict security assessment, given the lack of data processing or external input handling.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0",
