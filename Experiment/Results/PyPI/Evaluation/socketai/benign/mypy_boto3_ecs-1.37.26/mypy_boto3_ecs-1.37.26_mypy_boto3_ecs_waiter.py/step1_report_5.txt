  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for ECS service client waiters, providing structured type hints for AWS ECS waiters.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions imported from '.type_defs' and uses system version info for conditional imports. No external or user input data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines class methods with type annotations, but no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual or obfuscated code patterns. All imports and class definitions follow standard patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is purely structural, providing type annotations for waiters in AWS ECS SDK via boto3 stubs. It imports system modules, conditional typing imports, and defines classes inheriting from 'Waiter' with annotated 'wait' methods. No external data processing, user inputs, or network calls are embedded. The code is consistent with standard type hinting and class extension practices. No suspicious behaviors or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation module for AWS ECS waiters with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely enhances code clarity and type safety.",
