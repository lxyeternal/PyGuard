  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for ECS service client waiters, facilitating typed interactions with boto3 ECS waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and type_defs module; class method parameters using Unpack with specific type defs.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no data processing, storage, or transmission occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines class structures and method signatures without runtime data flows or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code contains only type annotations and class method definitions with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type annotation and class definition for waiters, leveraging standard AWS SDK patterns. It imports necessary modules, defines waiter subclasses, and annotates method parameters with specific types. There are no runtime data handling, external data sources, or potential injection points. The usage of 'Unpack' is conditional on Python version, which is standard for type hinting. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of typed ECS waiter classes for boto3. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support for AWS ECS waiters.",
