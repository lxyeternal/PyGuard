  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for ECS service waiters in boto3, providing structured waiting mechanisms for AWS ECS services and tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class method parameters using **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Use of **kwargs in wait methods, which are passed to the parent Waiter.wait(), potentially affecting AWS ECS resources via boto3.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs from the caller flow into the wait method, then into the parent Waiter.wait() which interacts with AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward class and method definitions with no hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for ECS waiters, with references to external documentation. It defines subclasses of Waiter for specific ECS states, with wait methods accepting flexible keyword arguments typed with Unpack. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or external data leaks. The use of type annotations and dynamic **kwargs is standard for such wrappers, and no input sources or sinks seem to lead to security issues beyond the intended AWS API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of AWS ECS waiter wrappers with proper type annotations. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as an interface for AWS service waiting mechanisms.",
