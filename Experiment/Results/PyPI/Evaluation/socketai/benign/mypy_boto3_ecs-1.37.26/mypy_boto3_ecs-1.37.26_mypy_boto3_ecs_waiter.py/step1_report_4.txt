{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and class definitions for ECS waiter objects in a Python SDK, facilitating waiting for specific ECS service states.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (sys, botocore.waiter, and custom type definitions) and the docstrings providing documentation URLs.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks; no network or system modifications are directly performed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves class method definitions that accept arbitrary keyword arguments with specific type annotations, primarily used for waiting operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions, imports, and docstrings; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of typed waiter classes for ECS, relying on the botocore.waiter.Waiter superclass. It imports necessary modules, defines classes with wait methods, and annotates method parameters with specific types. The URLs point to documentation, indicating transparency and no hidden or malicious links. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The use of type annotations and conditional import for Unpack demonstrates standard best practices for type safety, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type-safe wrapper around ECS waiters for use in larger applications. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK interface definitions.",
