  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS ECS client, providing type safety and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, local modules, and the class methods for ECS operations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code defines interface methods, type annotations, and documentation references without executing external commands or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Method definitions with type annotations serve as interface declarations; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code strictly provides type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a strongly-typed interface for the ECS client, utilizing Python type hints, overloads for paginators and waiters, and referencing external documentation. There are no runtime code executions, data manipulations, or network operations. The class methods are purely interfaces with descriptive docstrings. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. It appears to be a secure, well-structured stub implementation for AWS SDK typing.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign interface for the ECS client with type annotations and documentation references. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
