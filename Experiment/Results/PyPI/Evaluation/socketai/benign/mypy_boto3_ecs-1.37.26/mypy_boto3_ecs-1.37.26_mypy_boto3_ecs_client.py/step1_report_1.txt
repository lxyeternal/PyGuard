{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS ECS service, enabling type-safe interactions with the boto3 ECS client.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module, typing modules, botocore packages, and local type_defs, paginator, and waiter modules.",
  "sinks": "Methods that create or modify AWS ECS resources, or retrieve data, including create_, delete_, describe_, list_, update_, and get_paginator/get_waiter functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters via **kwargs unpacked into specific request type definitions, with responses typed accordingly; no data flows directly from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code predominantly consists of method definitions with docstrings referencing external AWS documentation. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. No signs of malicious data exfiltration or network communication are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly-typed interface for the ECS client, including properties, method signatures, and overloads for paginators and waiters. It relies on external modules for type definitions and uses standard practices for type annotations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as hidden network connections, data theft, or backdoors are present. The content appears to be standard boilerplate for a boto3 client stub implementation with extensive documentation and type safety, aiming to facilitate development rather than execute any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, non-malicious stub definition for the ECS boto3 client, providing type annotations and method signatures for safe, predictable use. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
