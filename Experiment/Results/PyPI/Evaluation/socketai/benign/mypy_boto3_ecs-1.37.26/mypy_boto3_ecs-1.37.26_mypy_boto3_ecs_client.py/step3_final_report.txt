{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and method signatures for the AWS ECS boto3 client, serving as a static interface for type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type hints, and documentation links within the class definitions and overloads.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform runtime operations.",
  "flows": "Static method signatures and type annotations define the interface; no data flows or runtime logic are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward type stub with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured type annotation layer for the boto3 ECS client. It contains method signatures, overloads for paginators and waiters, and extensive documentation references. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. The absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns indicates it is purely a static interface. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with its purpose as a type stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious type annotation interface for the AWS ECS boto3 client. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
