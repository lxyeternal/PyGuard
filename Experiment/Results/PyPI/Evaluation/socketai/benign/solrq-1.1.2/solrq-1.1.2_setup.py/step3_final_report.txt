  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'solrq', defining package metadata, version extraction, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '__init__.py' file; reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Extracting version via eval() from '__init__.py' to assign VERSION variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on content from '__init__.py' to parse version, which could be risky if the source is maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with minimal complexity. The only notable point is the use of eval() to parse the version string, which is common but can be a security concern if the source file is compromised. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The eval() usage is on a controlled source file, assuming source control integrity. The overall risk is low, but the eval() pattern warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the eval() on external source content, which could be exploited if the source file is tampered with. Scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) due to eval(). Overall, the code is safe under trusted source control conditions.",
