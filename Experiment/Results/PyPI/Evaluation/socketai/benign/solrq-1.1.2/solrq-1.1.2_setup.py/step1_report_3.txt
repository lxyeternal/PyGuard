  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging a Python library called 'solrq'.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__init__.py', reading README.md, fetching package list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted input or external data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> uses in setup(), reads README content -> used in long_description.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup tasks with no suspicious behavior or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, extracting version info from a source file, reading README content, and passing parameters to 'setuptools.setup'. It uses standard functions and does not perform any dynamic or malicious actions. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network or file manipulation beyond expected setup processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
