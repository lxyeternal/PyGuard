  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; reads version from `__init__.py` and description from `README.md`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; data flows are straightforward.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of `eval()` on version line, but minimal risk if source is controlled.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected. The use of `eval()` is typical but should be noted as a minor concern.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The minimal `eval()` risk is acknowledged. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; reads version info from `__init__.py`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted sinks; data flow is limited.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of `eval()` on source file content; potential risk if `__init__.py` is maliciously altered.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the security concern with `eval()`. No malicious activity detected, but the eval() introduces a possible attack vector if the source is compromised.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.4.  \n**Justification for risk score:** The report correctly identifies that `eval()` on external content is a potential security concern, even if the current code does not perform malicious actions. The risk score of 0.4 seems reasonable, considering the potential for malicious modification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; no anomalies.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; straightforward flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Completely standard, safe, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; standard setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script, safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (though risk is minimal).  \n**Assessment:** Correct; the minor risk score reflects the eval() concern but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard package setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted sinks.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, typical setup code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- The primary concern across multiple reports is the use of `eval()` on content from `__init__.py` to extract the version.  \n- While the current code does not exhibit malicious behavior, the use of `eval()` on external files is a known security risk if the source files are tampered with.  \n- The risk scores assigned (ranging from 0.2 to 0.4) seem appropriate, with some reports acknowledging the potential danger but noting that the code is not malicious per se.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation in any report.  \n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The overall **malware score** should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is present.  \n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.  \n- The **risk score** should be **around 0.2 to 0.4**, reflecting the potential risk introduced by `eval()` but not actual malicious intent.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for the `eval()` concern, but overall minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern regarding `eval()`. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the risk score slightly higher in some cases due to the `eval()` usage, but overall, the code appears safe.",
