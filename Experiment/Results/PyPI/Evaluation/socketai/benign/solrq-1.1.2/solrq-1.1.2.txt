      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the eval() on external source content, which could be exploited if the source file is tampered with. Scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) due to eval(). Overall, the code is safe under trusted source control conditions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for constructing safe Solr queries. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
