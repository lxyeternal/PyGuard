  "purpose": "Define and register various Metric classes for storage and retrieval in a registry system, including mapping metrics to integers and setting up encoders/decoders.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function parameters that read class types and registry dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Registry dictionaries that potentially map untrusted class types to identifiers or encoders, though these are internal and controlled.",
  "flows": "Input class types from parameters flow into the registry creation process, producing mappings and registries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of hashes for dynamic registry keys is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and libraries related to metrics and storage. It defines a metric registry mapping classes to integers, which appears to be a straightforward implementation. The 'register_metrics' function creates new registries by hashing class names if no explicit value is provided, and merges these with existing registries. The use of class names and hashes for registry keys is typical for dynamic registration. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured registration system for metrics, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard registry setup for metric classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious activities, nor does it contain hidden or obfuscated behaviors. The design is consistent with legitimate registry management for a metrics library.",
